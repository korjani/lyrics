That night that you got on a plane to Los Angeles I turned back into the me that I was 
That guy that would go out to buy a new porno and come back with twenty...the pervert you love 
And as I drove I remembered that you made a tape 
For me to play if I ever had a lonely day 
I slipped it in and the Stereophonics came on singing about matches 
Well at least someone still believes in the melody 
I, I think that I've heard it already but I 
I think that I must admit that as bad as it gets 
Someone still believes 
The sound of American radio's making me feel like I just killed my mom and my dad 
These pop songs are meant to be simple so people who make them we take them and break them in half 
But as I drove I remembered that you made a tape 
For me to play if I my ears were ever being raped 
I slipped it in and the Tragically Hip came on singing about matches 
Well at least someone still believes in the melody 
I, I think that I've heard it already but I 
I think that I must admit that as bad as it gets 
Someone still believes 

WhhoooAAAAAAWhhooo 

Well at least someone still believes in the melody 
I, I think that I've heard it already but I 
I think that I must admit that as bad as it gets
