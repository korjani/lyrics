He's got the dirtiest shoes that I ever seen
Chew on a blunt wipe his butt with a magazine
Smokin' his crack wash it down with gasoline
Still he push the button, E.F. Hutton when he speaks to me
Oh you know he told me "Shake it, don't break it
It took too damn long to make it"

[Chorus]
Leroy is my mojo man
Leroy is my mojo man
He come he take me by the hand
Cause Leroy is my mojo man tonight . . . alright!

He's just a pimp with a limp and some vaseline
He told me to "Look, over there!" and stole my nectarine
Said, "Don't turn your back on me black, I'm a sex machine" 
Still he push the button E.F. Hutton when he speaks to me
Oh you know he told me, "Shake it, don't break it; It took too damn long to make"

[Chorus]

Oh you know he told me, "Shake it, don't break it, it took too damn long to make it"
