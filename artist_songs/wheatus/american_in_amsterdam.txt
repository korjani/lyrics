It's only been an hour but I think I feel the power.
Tell me where do you guys wanna go to?
Well I could go for that but I need to buy a hat,
I think I saw some for sale on the small streets.

[Chorus:]
Can I play the game without a plan?
I think Pete has the map but tell me what's the difference?
Do not know exactly where I am.
I'm an American in Amsterdam.

Phil the mushroom jesus,
He is standing in between us preaching words that he doesn't believe.
I think that he is cracking,
Cuz he keeps calling me captain & he's barking and growling at strangers.
Later on tonight he's gonna turn back into Elvis,
When they kick his ass out of the sex show.

[Chorus:]
We play in a band that has no fans.
I think Pete lost the map, I don't know where we're going.
I'm trying to remember who I am.
I'm an American in Amsterdam.

Mike prefers a quiet conversation in the pub,
But the English are pissed drunk & raging.
"Hey Bono?" they said when they threw peanuts at my head and said
"Hey prick can we try on your glasses?"
Now I am just a dork, ut listen I come from New York so I said:
"Hey, what are you guys Irish?"

[Chorus:]
Came to play the game without a plan.
Pete puked on the map but tell me what's the difference?
I do not know exactly who I am.
I'm an American in Amsterdam.
