Hey!
Here I am
And I want you to see baby
I wanna watch you watchin me in motion
To taste the secret side of me
Every time I look at you, I know
You're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah

Hold my hand
I'm going to set you free baby
I'm gonna let fly all over me
Show me a lock, I'll show you the key
Every time you feel like holding back
I'm gonna pull you deeper
Always straying from the beaten track
And I will be the reaper

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah

Sugar............, Sugar............, Sugar............, Sugar............

Every time I look at you
I know you're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah
