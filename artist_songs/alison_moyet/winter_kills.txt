Green
In your love
On bright days
You grew sunblind
You thought me
Unkind
To remind you
How winter kills

Lost
In daydreams
You drove too fast
And got nowhere
You rode on half fare
When you got too scared
How winter kills

Tear at me, searching for
Weaker seams

Pain
In your eyes
Makes me cruel
Makes me spiteful
Tears are delightful
Welcome your nightfall
How winter kills

I tear at you, searching for
Weaker seams
