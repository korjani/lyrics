What can I do to make light of this dull dull day
What switch can I pull to illuminate the way
Show me one direction
I will not question again
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain

We all need a love resurrection
(just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love resurrection
(just a little divine intervention)

What seed must I sow to replenish this barren land
Teach me to harvest, I want you to grow in my hand
Let's be optimistic, let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together we'll never fall apart again

We all need a love resurrection
(just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love resurrection
(just a little divine intervention)

Show me one direction
I will not question again
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain
