In a fleeting moment of a restless day
Driven to distraction
I was captured by the game
I have often wondered why I ever wanted to
Leave these scattered hours behind me and speed myself to you

I choose never to forget

I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Set to work idle hands
Shake these thoughts
Had I planned them they never would be teasing me
As viciously as these

I would not have believed you
Had I never seen
Now you and I are intimately pictured
In my dreams
I could not forsake you or fall tumbling away
And if I live in wonderland
I'm better off this way

I choose never to forget

I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Set to work idle hands
Shake these thoughts
Had I planned them they never would be teasing me
As viciously as these

Is this love?
