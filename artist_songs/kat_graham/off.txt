If you wanna get it, take it off for me
Show me all the spots, that my hands can be
Don't be shy, crank up the heat
Turn it up, turn it up, let's get it on
Tell me that you need, what I got for ya
Give it to me good, wake the neighbors up
Don't be quiet, let me hear you loud
Turn it up, turn it up, let's get it on

[Chorus:]
Let's get it on get it on
Got your clothes on take 'em off
Come on baby tell me what you want
Let's get it on, get it on
Let's get it on get it on
Got your clothes on take 'em off
Come on baby tell me what you want
Let's get it on, ge-get it on
So what you wanna do (let's get it on), is what I wanna do (let's get it on)
So what you wanna do (let's get it on, get it on, get it on)
So what you wanna do (let's get it on), is what I wanna do (let's get it on)
So what you wanna do (let's get it on, get it on, get it on) what I wanna do

Why you wearing clothes, we don't need all that
Got nothin' on, but the smile I have
Don't play nice, I wanna see you bad
Keep it up, keep it up, let's get it on
I'mma work you out, yeah we go all night
Keep on going, till the sun gone shine
I won't stop, till you tell me to
Keep it up, keep it up, let's get it on

[Chorus]

Gimme all your love and, all your affection
Put a rubber on heart, in need of protection
Tight dress on, cause I want that attention
Gimme all your love love, gimme your love love
Gimme all your love love, gimme your love love
Gimme all your love love, gimme your love love
Gimme all your love love, gimme your love love
Gimme all your love love... give it to me now

[Chorus]
