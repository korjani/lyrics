I know it's over now, cause, I got the right man to love
I finally stopped the calls, yeah, I had to give you up
No more silly games (no) ain't tryna play the fool
(But) when I see your face (I) feel like I used to

I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like, maybe this ain't over
I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like, maybe this ain't over

What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they would never understand
What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they would never understand

Had to stop this love, it wasn't right to keep
Cause you ain't leaving her, no, he ain't leaving me
I think deep down we know, we're never meant to be
But damn I miss your touch (and) all the things you did to me

I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like, maybe this ain't over
I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like, maybe this ain't over

What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they will never understand
What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they will never understand

Let's keep it, keep it on the low
Let's keep it, keep it on the low (let's keep it)
Let's keep it, keep it on the low (let's keep it)
Let's keep it, keep it on the low

What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they will never understand
What are we gonna do now, when you got your girl and I got my man
Keep it on the low, cause they will never understand
