Been in it for a minute, and I just can't quit ya
Knowin' that I'm bad for you
You know damn well, this has to end
But you say there's nothing we can do

I can't resist, it so I get submissive
With every thought of you
Gotta give it up, with just my luck
Push me harder in love with you

Look, what you've done to me
Done to me, done to me
Baby look, what you've done to me
It's hard to be, without ya

Look, what you've done to me
Done to me, done to me
Baby look, what you've done to me
It's hard to be, without ya

Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)
Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)

Everytime I say no, I come back for more
Even though I said we're through
All you gotta do, is look at me right
Lookin' like you want it too

You say stop, but we keep at it
Tell me that you're tryin' too
I say go, walk out of my life
But there's one thing we gotta do

Look, what you've done to me
Done to me, done to me
Baby look, what you've done to me
It's hard to be, without ya

Look, what you've done to me
Done to me, done to me
Baby look, what you've done to me
It's hard to be, without ya

Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)
Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)

Feel it in my body knowin' that I'm losin' all control
Feel the way you love me and I just, can't let it go

Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)
Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)

Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)
Ooh, come here baby, come here baby
Ooh, come here baby (be my lover, be my love)
