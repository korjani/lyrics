That should be you and I
Two people with nothing to hide
Baby wouldn't that be nice?

Take me to church or take me home
I want to be close, but with the lights turned on
Cause all of the feelings and all of our lies
Are killing me cause I'm into you

All of my secrets turn me on cause nobody knows
My guilty conscience has gone rogue and it's left me alone with
All of my secrets, won't let me go
All of my secrets, yeah
All of my secrets, keep holding on
All of my secrets

Take me to a crowded room
And put your hands under my dress
Let everyone see the truth
So nobody has to guess

Take me to church or take me home
Take me somewhere where the world can know
Cause all of the feelings and all of our lies
Are killing me cause I'm into you

All of my secrets turn me on cause nobody knows
My guilty conscience has gone rogue and it's left me alone with
All of my secrets turn me on cause nobody knows
My guilty conscience has gone rogue and it's left me alone with
All of my secrets, won't let me go
