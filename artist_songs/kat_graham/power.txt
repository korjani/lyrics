I used to be a flower on the wall in the back row
Never was a homecoming queen just a shadow
Now I got a crown 'cause you gave it to me
Cleopatra strong, yeah you found it in me
Throwing all the pages of the past out the window
When you tell me that I'm beautiful, I feel it, I breathe it, believe it
Got me feeling indestructable, I love it, I scream it
With you, I'm a queen upon my throne
With you, I build a kingdom out of stone
You fill me up, you fill me up
I've got that power, power, power with you here
I've got that power, power, power with you here
It's so electric, baby, what you do to me
I've got that power, power, power with you here
You tell me that you love me in the fog on the mirror
You like me with no makeup on so you can see me clearer
Now I got a crown 'cause you gave it to me
Cleopatra strong, yeah you found it in me
Everything I ever dreamed about, got it right here
With you, I'm a queen upon my throne
With you, built a kingdom out of stone
You fill me up, you fill me up
I've got that power, power, power with you here
I've got that power, power, power with you here
It's so electric, baby, what you do to me
I've got that power, power, power with you here
When you tell me that I'm beautiful, I feel it, I breathe it, believe it
Got me feeling indestructable, I love it, I scream it
I love it, I scream it
With you, I'm a queen upon my throne
With you, built a kingdom out of stone
You fill me up, you fill me up
I've got that power, power, power with you here
I've got that power, power, power with you here
It's so electric, baby, what you do to me
I've got that power, power, power with you here
I've got that power, power, power with you here
