[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Mavado, tell em lick a shot; hollow. [gun shot]
Tell 'em say we straight; arrow
Tell 'em the flow tight; narrow
Everyting me did a'start, them borrow.
Cruised up, link my dudes up
The coupe black & blue, yup, it's bruised up!
I'm like, "Who's up?" Girls is used up
These bitches is my sons, I tied my tubes up!
Tell 'em again, bad gyal, toast is oozed up
I hit up Instagram, post some nudes up.
Uhn - bon fire, rev it, pop a wheelie!
Caribbean girls run it, ask RiRi!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Badness check, sexiness check

Let me dance for you
I might be thinking 'bout leaving my mans for you, (yeah)

[Outro: Mavado & Nicki Minaj]
