...Another one

[Hook: Drake]
Stay down with my day one niggas, and we in the club screaming
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new (DJ Khaled)
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new
I stay down from day one so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas
Stay down from day one,
So I say
(Fuck a  fake friends where your real friends at? Started!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ah, man this shit so ill that we had to restart it
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden
Money counter go burrr when you selling out the garden
Four car garage, pornstar ménage
Birdman go burrr cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
Switch your ass really call started from the bottom, yes lord
OVO sound man I'm proud of my niggas,
Knew we would make it never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me
If I had a baby mama she would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Aye, that's luxury dawg, day one niggas you're stuck with me dawg
Ever since YouTube niggas been calling me the leader of the new school
Fuck with me dawg, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Your bitch all in my photographs, hoe niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified, nothing niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game, feed fam nigga fuck fame
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing
Down in turks and caicos, dope boy that's my dress code
All I hug is blood nigga, Khaled that's my flesh though
All I want is love nigga, money bring that stress though
Smoke good I love life, strip club like every night
Every night my same niggas day one straight menace
Rozay!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I'm here with my niggas, I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name, well that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hating, I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies I wish we could trade places
Bitch we good fellas, boy all them niggas with you they just
Pole bearers and if we ball catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast Young Money stay young
I been Cash Money since day one
Tunechi

[Hook]
