[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)
I'm the one, yeah
Hear, you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin', don't run outta time now

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh

I'm the only one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh

[Quavo:]
Yo, yo. Quavo
I'm the one that hit that same spot. Hit it.
She the one that bring them rain drops, rain drops.
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch, hopscotch?
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot, hot.
I make your dreams come true when you wake up. Dream.
And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey
You can run inside my life from that fame bus
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous, yeah
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us. Why?
'Cause when we pull up—prr prr—all angles

[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no

[Chance The Rapper:]
Okay, though
She beat her face out with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

[Lil Wayne:]
Lookin' for the one, well, bitch, you're looking at the one
I'm the best yet and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any-fuckin'-body
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Moolah gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God

[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)
