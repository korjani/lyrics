I know a nigga that's doin' life
All because his Codeine had fo'
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold, that fuck nigga told
His home boy was a Dboy, but he act like a CI
Takin' notes like a PI, carried on like a peon
You see a fuck nigga holler "FBI"
I've seen him on first 48, said he had everything on tape
And he the nigga with the gun and the drum
And his hands hold and fuck nigga turned staple
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin' 'bout a nigga that put him on on death row
These niggas too cutthroat, and as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up
