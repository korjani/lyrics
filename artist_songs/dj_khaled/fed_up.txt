DJ Khaled
the streets is fed up (who else nigga?)
we fed up (we the best)
the runners, usher talk to em

[Usher-Chorus]
it was all a dream yeah homey I am on my job
and you can’t take that away from me (can’t take that away)
yeah I got my team and I got all of my niggas behind me (see me nigga)
and they give me the love I need (yeah)
I got my foot in the door we still hustlin for more
check in the game and back in the light (yeahh)
I’m fed up (ayy) I’m fed up (ayy) I’m fed up (ay)
I’m so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely positively on my grizzy
even though I’m sick and I’m tired I gets busy
started a 62 but it ended up a frisbee
and me I like to sit at the stove until I’m dizzy
ball so hard it’s like I brought the game with me
left my glove so white you thought I brought jermaine with me
bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I’m fed up, I’m fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryna sue me bitches tryna do me
way these niggas actin you’d a thought they never knew me
but these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I’m fed up probably why I’m actin like the old me

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I’m sick and tired of you suckas so now I’m fed up
somebody catch the chain I’m bout to tear his head off
shorty bendin over know I’m bout to tear it up
before you let your top back get your bread up
made history but now we claimin victory
get ya out the white house go back to your efficiencies
suckas feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I’m fed up, I’m fed up)
like IRS you wonderin what I’m makin yearly
let them brown bags circulate (stack) so I perpetrate (never)
we shining in the bottom cause we down to twekalate
lookin at the parking lot better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right (Ross)

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uh, me and Wayne was gettin high on em
he leaned over and told me just don’t retire on em
and when they give ya they shoulders never cry on em
and when they love you to death just never die on em
and the question still remains
have I counted all the money that I’ve managed to obtain?
niggas dedicating overtime to damaging my name
and somehow I’m still the hottest mofucka in the game

[Lil Wayne]
I’m happy to be back man….
I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all prenatal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Frado
Uhh I’m sick of being criticized
That’s why I’m higher than a star trek enterprise
I do it big don’t get mad cuz you minimized
I keep a red flag case I get penalized..uh
Its young money like you didn’t know
Stop playing I hit Drizzy with the give and go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us, you seeing things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart no tin man
Uhh..Kha Kha Khaled I’m fed up,
flow wake the dead up
Weezy

[Usher]
yeah how bout I been in this been breakin records since ‘9-4
so I aint gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
records that I hold
and records that I’ve sold
and I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeahhhhh)
don’t bite the hand of your provider
cause man if I aint influenced you you a liar
I’m on fire you just a biter you need to wake up and realize

[Chorus]
