Inside you know a heart fooled of hope
Inside you know an empire of soul

To hold on for love
Hurts me, it's slow
One word's enough
One word this time
It never comes

Faith...
It's all the rage

To hold on for love
Hurts me, it's slow
One word's enough
One word this time
It never comes
It never comes

Faith...
It's all the rage
It's all the rage
It's all the rage
