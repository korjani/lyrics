Send a message, to my heart
Tell it everything, from the start
Make it honest, make it true
It’s the only way, we’ll see it through

Send them all, the letters
Fit them all, together
Set in stone, forever
Make it whole, and never
Tell a soul, endeavour
To be told

Send a message, to my heart
Send a message to my heart
With every beat I hear it speaking loud and clear
Send a message to my heart

Break it gently, or break me down
Don’t say anything, don’t make a sound
Actions, although they hurt
It’s the feelings, that really burn

Send them all, the letters
Fit them all, together
Set in stone, forever
Make it whole, and never
Tell a soul, endeavour
To be told

Send a message, to my heart
Send a message to my heart
With every beat I hear it speaking loud and clear
Send a message to my heart

Send them all, the letters
Fit them all, together
Set in stone, forever
Make it whole, and never
Tell a soul, endeavour
To be told

Send a message to my heart
Send a message to my heart
Send a message to my heart
Send a message to my heart
