Hey, Miss Murder, can I—
Hey, Miss Murder, can I
Make beauty stay if I take my life?

Whoa-oh-oh

With just a look they shook
And heavens bowed before him.
Simply a look can break your heart.
The stars that pierce the sky;
He left them all behind.
We’re left to wonder why
He left us all behind.

Hey, Miss Murder, can I—
Hey, Miss Murder, can I
Make beauty stay if I take my life?

Whoa-oh-oh
oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass
Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down.

The stars that mystify
He left them all behind.
And how his children cried
He left us all behind.

Hey, Miss Murder, can I—
Hey, Miss Murder, can I
Make beauty stay if I take my life?

Whoa-oh-oh

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it.
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out without hope.
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised.
Reaching for that golden ring we'd never let go,
Who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Hey, Miss Murder, can I—
Hey, Miss Murder, can I
Make beauty stay if I take my life?

Whoa-oh-oh

Hey, Miss Murder, can I—
Hey, Miss Murder, can I
Make beauty stay if I take my life?

Whoa-oh-oh
