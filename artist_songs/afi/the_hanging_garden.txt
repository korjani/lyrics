[The Cure cover song]

Creatures kissing in the rain,
shapeless in the dark again.
In the hanging garden, please don't speak.
In the hanging garden, no one sleeps.
In the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
Catching haloes on the moon,
gives my hands the shapes of angels.
In the heat of the night, the animals scream.
In the heat of the night, walking into a dream...
Fall, fall, fall, fall into the walls.
Jump, jump out of time.
Fall, fall, fall, fall out of the sky.
Cover my face as the animals cry,
in the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
Creatures kissing in the rain,
shapeless in the dark again.
In a hanging garden, change the past.
In a hanging garden, wearing furs and masks...
Fall, fall, fall, fall into the walls.
Jump, jump out of time.
Fall, fall, fall, fall out of the sky.
Cover my face as the animals die.
In the hanging garden.
as the animals die.
Cover my face as the animals die.
In the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
In the hanging garden.
