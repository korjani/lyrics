Warn your warmth to turn away,
Here it's December,
Everyday. [small girlish echo:] I like that

Press your lips to the sculptures,
And surely you'll stay. [distant:] love like winter

For of sugar and ice,
I am made. I am made

It's in the blood,
It's in the blood.
I met my love before I was born.
He wanted love,
I taste of blood.
He bit my lip, and drank my warmth,
From years before, from years before.

She exhales vanilla lace,
I barely dreamt her, yesterday. [echo:] yesterday
Read the lines in the mirror through,
The lipstick trace.
Por siempre

She said "It seems you're somewhere, far away" to his face.

It's in the blood,
It's in the blood.
I met my love before I was born.
She wanted love,
I taste of blood.
She bit my lip, and drank my warmth,
From years before, from years before.

Love Like Winter.

Love Like Winter.

Winter.
Three, four

It's in the blood,
It's in the blood.
I met my love before I was born.
He wanted love,
I taste of blood.
He bit my lip, and drank my warmth,
From years before, from years before.
From years before.
