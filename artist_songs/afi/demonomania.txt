[The Misfits cover song]

Look upon me, I am the beast...
Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania, my father was a wolf.
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania, my mother was a whore.
you check and see we aren't like other wolves.
It's in the blood, I wanna be the fucking savior.
Humans are weak, what else you fucking do?
Humans are weak, I want your blood.
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania, my father was a wolf.
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania, my mother was a whore.
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania, my mother was a whore.
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania, My father was a wolf.
