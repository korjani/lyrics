[Whispering]

Walked into our world and made
Horrible sounds.
I can still hear them today
(strangely they seem)
Beautiful now,
though they outlast my love.

Still each time I always meant,
Every word,
Every one.
Though in time they finally bent,
Every word,
Every one.

Every word.

"I will wait for you." She said,
Endlessly.
"I will wait for you." So spoke,
Misery.

I returned to you but found,
My empty home.
The radio told me to stay.
As it burned down
I sang alone.
You will outlast my love.

Still each time I always meant,
Every word,
Every one.
Though in time they finally bent,
Every word,
Every one.

Every word.

"I will wait for you." She said,
Endlessly.
"I will wait for you." So spoke,
Misery.

Oh.

I have been waiting for you,
Biting as you taught me to.
I have come to relieve you,
Of life and love.

I will wait for you.
I will wait for you.
I will wait for you.

I will wait.

I will wait.

"I will wait for you." She said,
Endlessly.
"I will wait for you." So spoke,
Misery.

"I will wait for you"
Wait for you,
Endlessly.

"I will wait for you."
So spoke.

So spoke,
Misery.

I will bite straight through.
As I wait for you
Dear,
Endlessly.
