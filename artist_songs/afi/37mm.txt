Bring your secrets to me,
Just give me your hands,
And I'll let you feel the wounds.
They put in me.

If you believe in me,
How can I be dissolving?
If you'd believe me,
I'd tell you everything.

Do you fall too?
(everytime that I)
Yes, I fall.
(everytime that I)
Do you want to,
(try to pacify)

Fall into me?
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.

Silence can you hear me?
Press me to your lips,
And I'll suck the poison out.
Who will heal me? me..

If you keep killing me,
How can I keep absolving?
Your sins into me,
Begin the poisoning.

Do you fall too?
(everytime that I)
Yes, I fall.
(everytime that I)
Do you want to,
(try to pacify)

Fall into me?
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.

Time, time, time,
We're not, waiting.
Time, time, time
We're no one.

[distant:] unknown. unknown.

Do you fall too?
(everytime that I)
Yes, I fall.
(everytime that I)
Do you want to?
(try to pacify)

Fall into me
(fall into me)

Do you fall too?
(everytime that I)
Yes, I fall.
(everytime that I)
Do you want to,
(try to pacify)

Fall into me
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.
