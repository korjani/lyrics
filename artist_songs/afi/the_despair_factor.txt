Along the path where the stream is talking,
I breathe the mist and continue walking. 
The wood it whispers in a language of it's own. 
As a sigh escaped my lips,
I feel the light caress of fingertips that,
steal away the breath and leave me on my own.

Waiting by the stairs. (Waiting, I despair)
Waiting, I despair. (Waiting by the stairs)

My whole life is a dark room. 
One, big, dark room.

Do I hear the hollow sound,
Footsteps resounding on this frozen ground, 
Or the familiar disappointment of the echoes of my own? 

Waiting by the stairs. (Waiting i despair)
Waiting, I despair. (Waiting by the stairs)

[whispers:]
Somehow I ended up here in between,
Where there is always the comfort,
Of knowing I'll never be seen.
When I fall
When I fall
I wait for just one touch,
And I fall

Weightless,
Endless,
Faithless, I'll adore you. 
A single touch, before I fade. Painless let me pass through.
Weightless,
Endless,
Faithless, I'll adore you. 
A single touch, before I fade. Painless let me pass through.
