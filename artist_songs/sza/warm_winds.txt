[Intro: SZA]
Hey, hey glory child, hey

[Verse 1: SZA]
Hey glory child, don't you worry
Stuttering, shaken off your fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

[Hook: SZA]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today, you could
Come home today

[Verse 2: SZA]
I am shooting stars you will never see me
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel, here to take
Always playing catch me if you can
Gingerbread you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes let go and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

[Hook]

[Beat Change]

[Intro: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away
Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away
Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away

Call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

[Hook: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
Quit clipping on your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

Quit clipping on your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride

[Verse 1: SZA]
Sometimes, I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes, I crack my veins so bad
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SZA]
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live, lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann
You will never judge me for that
You will always love me for that

[Outro: SZA]
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
