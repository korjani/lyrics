Let the church say Amen
Release all my sins at the pulpit
Its the beginning [8x]
Its the beginning of my sermon
You hold my hand as an infant
Palms to the sky, Adonai, Ya Allah
Till they all come down
Till we all fall down
Down...

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

Up here, the air is so thin
Mountains on my fingertips
I stand at the tippy, screaming at the top of my lungs
Tears in my eyes
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you hear me?!
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you're near me?!

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

It's the beginning
