I used to like you the way you were
When you were nice to me
When you were insecure
Found out how dope a nigga you really are
Now you got lots to say
Now you got hoes for days
Where do I fit in
Now you got everything
Now you so over me
Where do I get in
I mean can I just come over later
I'm over worked and under loved
Can't you just do me a favor
Could you pretend that I'm the one you love
Yea, yea

Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us

I bet you like me the way I was
When I was insecure
I mean I'm still for sure
I know I'm better than you and know what I deserve
More than borrowed time
More than nouns and verbs
I wanna be somebody's somebody
I don't want to collect dust in your pocket
I mean can I just come over later
I'm over worked and under loved
Can't you just do me a favor
Can you-
Yea, yea

Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us

Let's pretend that we are more than passing ships in the night
Let's pretend like it's just us
Let's pretend that we are strong enough to put up a fight
Let's pretend that it's just us
