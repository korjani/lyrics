I apologize for waiting to tell you for so long
I am not human
I am made of bacon, fairy tales, pixie dust, I don't feel
I hung myself and didn't die
I'm omnipotent, I'm alive
Not real, I'm alive

You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

[Hook:]
Caught up in the blast
Caught up in the action
Caught up in the bursting flame
There's comfort in dying
There's comfort in burning I burn

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
Living as a unicorn gets so lonely
I have no answers
I have No questions
Stuck in your tandem
Heat that's worth standing
I like it

[Hook]

I can feel the accidents happening slowly
Falling for the rapture ever so boldly
I will go willingly
You don't have to kidnap
I'd like to be kidnapped
You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
