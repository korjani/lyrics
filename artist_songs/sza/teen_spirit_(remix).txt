[50 Cent:]
Yea, 50
I view a mind like something I can explore
A fat ass is cool but baby I want more
Someone I can adore
Be down for
Share time even my spare time travel on G5s baby no airlines
Shine like we suppose to shine
Because baby when we grind it's like everything's on the line
Your my bottom that's the best be my best friends
Step out with me best dress
I want the world to see you like I see you through my eyes
Sunshine blue sky you beautiful dream of mine
I forgive you for confusion and mistakes that you make
Like everything about you even freckles in your face
Quit playing come here

[SZA:]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me!
To think I had it..
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping on my shoulder
I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it..

[Hook:]
Yeah yeah, I feel you talking
Yeah yeah I feel you moving
Yeah yeah let's do it already
Yeah yeah..

[Verse 2:]
Chipping away at boulders
I conquer fire
40 days 40 nights
No New Star
Fuck your Third Eye!
I be the One
Neo of the Sun
Give me simplicity
To lonely seems like real fun
I feel you
Creeping up my leg I hear you talking
Moving on my shoulder I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it

[Bridge:]
Don't come close
Don't come close
You don't even know me, know me

[50 Cent:]
I'm not conventional or offer to my concepts
Look in my eyes girl I woo you with my intellect
It says gangs not a game this is real shit
Said you was down the one I should keep it real with
Now you acting like I owe you and you sayin I don't know you
And you sayin I don't know you I don't know the pin to my ATM
When the bill collector come bet you know me then
I ain't fucking with you

[SZA:]
Yeah yeah, I feel you talking
Yeah yeah I feel you moving
Yeah yeah let's do it already
Yeah yeah..
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
