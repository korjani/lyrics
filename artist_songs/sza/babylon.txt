[Intro:]
Clarity is a state of mind
Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
I ain't buying that
No matter what the...

[Hook:]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1:]
I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway?
Not me

[Bridge:]
Are you hating youself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now
I bet you hate me now
Bring on the thorn and crown
Crucify me

[Verse 2:]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway, spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway?
You're mine any day
It's burning
Take me
I wanna feel
Your power
This final hour
Tell me

Are you losing yourself?
Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

[Bridge]
