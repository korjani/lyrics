You say you love me 
I don't know, I wonder why 
You, yes you say you need me 
I don't know, I wonder why 
Maybe tomorrow I will know 
Maybe tomorrow it will show 

You say you need me 
I don't know, I wonder why 
You could not want to love me 
I don't know, I wonder why 
Maybe tomorrow I will know 
Maybe tomorrow it will show 

You say I'm your kind of man 
I don't know, I wonder why 
That I'll never understand 
I don't know I wonder why 
Maybe tomorrow I will know 
Maybe tomorrow it will show 

You say you love me 
You say you love me 
You say you love me 
You say you love me
