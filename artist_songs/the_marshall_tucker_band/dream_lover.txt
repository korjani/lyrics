Was a time when friends of mine said
Love was just a game
Find a girl and give her a whirl, then
Move on, all the same

But I was never happy
Always searching for this one
The dream to be my lover
And the dream she'd give me a son

I've searched this whole world over
'Bout a hundred times or more
Always looking for a girl I could love
Forever more

Dream lady, sexy Sadie, oh, I've dreamed
All my life of you
Dream lover, there's no other, oh girl
You could make all my dreams come true

[CHORUS]

Dream lover, oh, where are you?
If I could find you I'd love you true
Dream lover you're in my mind
Oh, lord, why does love have to be so unkind?

But I found a girl with loving
One to share my hopes and dreams
A friend to stand beside me
And the lover of my dreams

[CHORUS]
