When the morning sun
Melts the morning dew
I'll be loving you

When the evening sun
Tells me the day is done
I'll be loving you

[CHORUS]

And I'll be loving you
Until my dying days
And I'll be loving you
Just an old fool set in my ways

Although it seems
That you are in my dreams
I'll be loving you

Somehow I know
It's really gotta show
That I'll be loving you

[CHORUS]

It won't mean the same
If you never know my name
Cause I'll be loving you

When the morning sun
Melts the morning dew
I'll be loving you

[CHORUS]
