It's a lonesome road
And a hard way to live
But it's the only life that I know
I met some people, I traveled around
But home's always the best place to go

It's a lonesome feeling in my mind
A feeling that I can't leave behind
Carolina's where I'm at, and
I'll always hang my hat
Under those Blue Ridge Mountain skies

I got me a woman back home
She gave me a baby, too
And she stands by my loving side and
Does anything I ask her to

It's a lonesome feeling in my mind
A feeling I can't seem to leave behind
Carolina's where I'm at, and
I'll always hang my hat
Under those Blue Ridge Mountain skies

There's an old man, sittin' in a rockin' chair
He's got the best beagle dog in the county I've been told
But his shotgun done got too rusty
That 'ole beagle dog he done grown a little too old
As he stares up into heaven, I'm sure I know the reason why
He's thinking about that promised land in them Blue Ridge Mountain skies

It's a lonesome feeling in my mind
A feeling I can't seem to leave behind
Carolina's where I'm at, and
I'll always hang my hat
Under those Blue Ridge Mountain skies
