Gonna take a freight train
Down at the station, Lord
I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain
Jump off, nobody gonna know

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
I'm gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady, now
A mean ol' woman, Lord
Never told me goodbye

Can't you see, oh, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna buy a ticket, now
As far as I can
Ain't a-never comin' back
Ride me a southbound
All the way to Georgia, now
Till the train, it run out of track

Can't you see, oh, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

Can't you see (oh, she's such a crazy lady), can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see (Lord, I can't stand), can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

Can't you see (I'm gonna take a freight train), can't you see (down at the station, Lord)
What that woman, she been doin' to me (ain't never comin' back)
Can't you see (gonna ride me a southbound, now), can't you see (all the way to Georgia, Lord)
What that woman, she been doin' to me (till the train run out of track)
