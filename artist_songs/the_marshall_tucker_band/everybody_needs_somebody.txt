Listening for a faint sound
Gazing out the window I see
Winds blowing clouds
Wish they were taking me
A lonesome song on the radio
Reminds me of where I'd like to be

[Chorus:]
Everybody needs somebody
To help them make it through life
Arms to hold, words to soothe
Someone to say that it's all right

Too many miles of road, I really can't complain
These lonely hotel rooms are driving me insane
My life's a hard life, wouldn't have it any other way
Someday darling, I'll be coming home to stay

[Chorus]

Songs of the highway, one night stands
It can take it's toll on any kind of man
Lord, I miss you and I ain't afraid to say
Someday darling, I'll be coming home to stay

[Chorus]
