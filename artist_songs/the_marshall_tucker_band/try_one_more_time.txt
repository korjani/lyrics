My glass is empty, but innocently 
Just sittin here thinkin how much you mean to me 
Thought about leavin, but you know you're one of a kind 
And even though we tried it all 
I'd like to try it more time.. 

Said tonight at the party, you wore your finest dress 
You walked around in style lookin so much finer than the rest 
And when you walked up to me, Lord 
You know I was so proud 
And even though we tried it all 
I'd like to try it more time..
