Am I the kind of man 
That lives by his heart 
Who believes in God almighty 
Not fearin' the devil or the dark 
Always there when you need me to be 
Hold your hand, say I love you 
In those hours of need 
Wish you could close your eyes 
Truthfully one day say them things to me 

Am I the kind of man 
That thinks he's strong 
To stand up in a crowd 
And admit when he's wrong 
When you're in trouble 
To no one else you'll ever plead 
Knock on my door, say honey 
You're the man I needed to see 
Wish you could close your eyes 
Truthfully one day say them things to me 

I know I ain't been much 
But I'm tryin' 
Things have been rough lately 
I'm not denyin' 
But I'm gonna try somehow 
To be a better man 
'Cause my heart and soul 
Is tryin' as hard as it can 

Am I the kind of man 
Who believes in peace 
Who'll stand up and fight in a minute 
Over something that he believes 
Loves all his brothers 
Treats his elders with respect 
Never heard me say that I don't give a damn 
What the hell, who gives a heck 

Wish you could close your eyes 
Truthfully one day say them things to me 
'Cause you're the only woman alive 
That can make that kind of man out of me
