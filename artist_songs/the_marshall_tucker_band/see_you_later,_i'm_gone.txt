I've been thinkin' about the way you've been doin' me, now for a long long time.
When a woman acts the way you do, well somewhere ya have to draw the line.

Empty liquor bottles, and crowded bar rooms, seems to be your home.
Now that I know the way you feel for me, I guess it's time for me to move on.

I have tried everything, to make you see my way.
But now I'm tired of being made a fool, I beleive it's time I had my say, aw ya.

Goodbye woman, I'm leavin' you, so long heart ach, so long.
I hope you're happy somewhere down lover's lane, see you later I'm gone.
