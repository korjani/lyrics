I say, how can you say
Where I'll be from day to day
When I don't even know myself
But the life that I lead
Is so full of mysteries
That's why I'm always on my way
And I'll be running like the wind
Running like the wind

The words you're about to hear,
Even to me they're not very clear
You see love has never come my way
But come and fly with me
Through life's many fantasies
And I'll show you a new dream every day
And I'll be running like the wind
Running like the wind
And you'll never hear us say
We might be back again some day
Well we won't - we'll be running like the wind
Running like the Wind

I'm sure in your mind
That you vision this paradise
A place we could live for evermore
So let's search wide and far
For that mountain or that shooting star
A sign that might show us that way 

And we'll be running like the wind
Running like the wind
And you'll never hear us say
We might be back again some day
Well we won't - we'll be running like the wind
Running like the Wind

One day you'll realize
As you look into my aging eyes
You'll hold my hand and you'll say
That you'll always drift my way
Like two leaves blowing on an autumn day
And love me as long as there's wind in the sky

And we'll be running like the wind
Running like the wind
And you'll never hear us say
We might be back again some day
Well we won't, we'll be running like the wind
Running like the Wind
