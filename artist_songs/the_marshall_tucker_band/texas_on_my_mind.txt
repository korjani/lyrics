I can't believe this time I'm leaving
All along you'd thought I'd stay
But a man's got to do what his heart
Tells him to come what may

So I guess this time tomorrow
I'll be on my way
'Cause I got Texas on my mind again today

I can't deny I've had this feeling
Every minute I've been gone
But someday you will see
You will forget me moving on

So when the sun comes up tomorrow
That's the end of my stay
'Cause I had Texas on my mind again today

Every time I hear an old guitar
Fiddled in harmony
It takes me back to what I long for
A place I long to be

So I guess I'll take this old guitar
I'll be up and on my way
'Cause I got Texas on my mind
Lord, I got Texas on my mind
I got Texas on my mind again today
