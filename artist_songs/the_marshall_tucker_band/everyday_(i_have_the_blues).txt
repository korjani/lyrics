Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday,
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share
