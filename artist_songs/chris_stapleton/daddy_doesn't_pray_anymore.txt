[Chorus:]
Daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore

I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace

[Chorus]

There was a time when we didn’t get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I’d hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]

Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God’s word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn’t make a sound
This afternoon we’ll lay him in the ground
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore
