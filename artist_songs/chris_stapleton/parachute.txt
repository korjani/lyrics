Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus:]
You only need a roof when it’s raining
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

There’s a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

[Chorus]

If you think you’re going down
Just know I will be around

[Chorus]
