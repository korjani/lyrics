There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright,
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face,
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes,
But sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else.

Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on,
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you,
Cause ever since, and every single night you been gone,
Sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else.
