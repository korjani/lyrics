Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye
he'll "do," he'll never be "done to"
he takes on whoever flew through
"WELL, IT'S THE NORMAL THING TO DO"
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love
now kissing with his mouth full
and his eyes on some other fool
so many women
his head should be spinning
AH, BUT NO!
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words:
"there's no need to be so KNOWING
take life at five times your 
average speed, like I do"
until Jim feels the chill
"oh, where did all the time go?"
once always in for the kill
now it's too cold
and he feels too
