Satellite's gone up to the skies
Thing like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while

Soon it will be filled with parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I cannot stand the TV

Satellite of love
Satellite of love

I've been told that you've been happy
With Harry, Mark and John
Monday, Tuesday, anyday but Thursday
With Harry, Mark and John

Satellite's gone up to the skies
Thing like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I cannot bear the TV
