I'm doing very well
I can block out the present and the past now
I know by now you think I should have straightened myself out
Thank you, drop dead

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no love in modern life

I'm doing very well
It's a miracle I've even made it this far
The motion of taxis excite me
Will you peel it back and bite me?

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no hope in modern life

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can't fight
No true friends in modern life

Diazapam... that's Valium
Tarmazpam, Lithium

HRT, ECT... how long must I stay on this stuff?

Please don't gimme anymore... [repeat]
