He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)

My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"
