Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Oh, Dagenham Dave 

"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave
