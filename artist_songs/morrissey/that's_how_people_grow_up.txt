I was wasting my time
Trying to fall in love
Disappointment came to me and
Booted me and bruised and hurt me

But that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

I was wasting my time
Looking for love
Someone must look at me and
See their sunlit dream
I was wasting my time
Praying for love
For a love that never comes
From someone who does not exist

And that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

Let me live
Before I die
No not me
Not I

I was wasting my life
Always thinking about myself
Someone on their deathbed said
There are other sorrows too

I was driving my car
I crashed and broke my spine
So yes there are things worse in life than
Never being someone's sweetie

That's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

That's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

As for me I'm okay
For now anyway
