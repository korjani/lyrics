Oboe concerto

All the best ones are dead 
And there's a song I can't stand 
And it's stuck in my head

There's a song I can't stand 
And it's stuck in my head

Oboe concerto 
All I do is drink to absent friends 
And there's a song I can't stand 
And it's stuck in my head

There's a song I can't stand 
And it's stuck in my head

The older generation have tried, sighed & died 
Which pushes me to their place in the queue

Round, rhythm goes round 
Round, round rhythm of life goes round 
Round, the rhythm goes round 
Round, round rhythm of life goes round 
Round, the rhythm goes round 
Round, round rhythm of life goes round 
Round, the rhythm goes round 
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
