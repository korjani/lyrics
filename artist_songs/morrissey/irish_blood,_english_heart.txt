Irish blood, English heart 
This I'm made of 
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of 
And no regime can buy or sell me 

I've been dreaming of a time when 
to be English is not to be baneful 
to be standing by the flag, not feeling shameful 
racist or partial 

Irish blood, English heart 
this I'm made of 
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of 
And I will die with both of my hands untied 

I've been dreaming of a time when 
the English are sick to death 
of Labour, and Tories 
and spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell 
and denounce this royal line that still salute him 
and will salute him 
Forever...
