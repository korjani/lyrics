Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS
