Something in you caused me to
take a new tack with you
You were going through something
I had just about scraped through
Why do you think I let you get away
with the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

No one I ever knew
or have spoken to resembles you
This is good or bad
all depending on my general mood
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

Magistrates who spend their lives
hiding their mistakes
They look at you and I
and envy makes them cry
Envy makes them cry

Forces of containment
They shove their fat faces into mine
You and I just smile
because we're thinking the same line
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

You're not right in the head
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why

This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
Because you're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you...
