Losing in front of your home crowd 
You wish the ground 
Would open and take you down 
And will time ever pass? 
Will time never pass for us? 
Your weary wife is walking away 
Your nephew, it's true 
Well, he thinks the world of you 
And I have to close my eyes 
Losing in front of your home town 
The crowd call your name 
They love you all the same 
The sound, the smell, and the spray 
You will take them all away 
And they'll stay 
Till the grave 
Your weary wife is walking away 
Your nephew, it's true 
Well, he thinks the world of you 
And I have to close my eyes 
Losing in your home town 
Hell is the bell 
That we'll not ring again 
You will return one day 
Because of all the things that you see 
When your eyes close 
Your weary wife - walking away 
Your nephew, it's true 
He still thinks the world of you 
And I have to dry my eyes
