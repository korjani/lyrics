Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you 
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength 
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you 
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"
