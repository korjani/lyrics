And now in my cell 
(Well, I followed you) 
And here's a list of who I slew

Oh, don't say you don't 
Please say you do, (oh) I am:
The last of the famous International playboys

And in my cell 
(Well, I loved you)

Such things I do 
Just to make myself More attractive to you 
HAVE I FAILED ? 
Oh, the last of the famous International playboys 
The last of the famous
