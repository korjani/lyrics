With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)

I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying 
("goodbye")

I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
