An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you
