And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do? 
And is evil just something you are

Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths

A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy
