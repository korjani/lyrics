I'm writing this to say
in a gentle way
Thank You - but no
I will live my life as I
will undoubtedly die - alone
I'm writing this to say
in a gentle way
Thank you...
I will live my life as I...
for whether you stay
or you stray
an inbuilt guilt catches up with you
and as it comes around to your place
at 5 a.m. it wakes you up
and laughs in your face
