You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care, but don't stare
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
They who wish to hurt you
Work within the law

This world is full, oh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
and love me"

You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care and say a prayer
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
Educated criminals work within the law

This world is full
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me
And love me"

What really lies
Beyond the constraints of my mind?
Could it be the sea
With fate mooning back at me?
No, it's just more lock-jawed pop-stars
Thicker than pig-shit
Nothing to convey
So scared to show intelligence
It might smear their lovely career

This world - I am afraid -
Is designed for crashing bores
I am not one
I am not one
You don't understand
You don't understand

And yet you can
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
And love me
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Would you do, would you do what you should do?
