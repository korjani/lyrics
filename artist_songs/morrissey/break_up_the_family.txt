The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye
