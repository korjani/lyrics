My love,
Wherever you are,
Whatever you are,
Don't lose faith.
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you.
Please wait . . .
Please wait . . .
Ah, ha, ha,
Wait . . .
Don't lose faith.

You say that the day
Just never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away.
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
To you.
Please wait . . .
Don't lose faith
