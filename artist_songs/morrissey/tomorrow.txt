Tomorrow,
Will it really come?
And if it does come,
Will I still be human?

All I ask of you,
Is one thing that you never do,
Would you put your arms around me,
(I won't tell anyone).
Tomorrow,
Does it have to come.

All I ask of you,
Is one thing that you'll never do,
Would you put your arms around me,
(I won't tell anybody).
Tomorrow,
And what must come before...

Oh! The pain in my arms!
Oh! The pain in my legs!
Oh! My shiftless body.

Tomorrow,
It's surely nearer now.

You don't think I'll make it,
I never said I wanted to.
Well, did I?

Oh! the pain in my arms!
Oh! the pain in my legs!
Oh yeah! and oh yeah!
And, Oh yeah! and oh yeah!
Oh! Through my shiftless body.

Tomorrow,
Tomorrow.

All I ask of you, oh, oh-oh,
Is would you tell me that you love me,
Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me.

Oh! I know you don't mean it.
Oh! I know you don't mean it.

Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me oh! Tell me oh! Tell me oh! . . .
