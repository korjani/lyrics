I am hated for loving
I am hated for loving
anonymous call, poison pen
brick in the small of the back again
I still don't belong
to anyone - I AM MINE
I am hated for loving
I am haunted for wanting
anonymous call, poison pen
brick in the small of the back again
I still don't belong
to anyone - I AM MINE
I am falling
with no noe to catch me
I am falling
and there's still
no one to catch me
anonymous call, poison pen
brick in the small of the back again
I still don't belong
to anywhere
I just don't belong
