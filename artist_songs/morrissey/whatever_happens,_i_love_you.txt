Late, secret means
But never in my favour 
But when all is said and done 
It's you I love 
Cold loving prose 
We stole each other's clothes 
But when all is said and done 
It's you I love 
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes ...
Fights for rights 
Everyone's oh so quick with advice 
And when they've all said their piece 
It's still you I love 
Now just like then 
Then, then, then, then, then, yes, yes 
No, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
Mmm ...
