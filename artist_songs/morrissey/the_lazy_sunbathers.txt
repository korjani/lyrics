A world war
was announced
days ago
but they didn't know
the lazy sunbathers
the lazy sunbathers
the sun burns through
to the planet's core
and it isn't enough
they want more
Nothing
appears
to be
between the ears of
the lazy sunbathers
too jaded
to question stagnation
the sun burns through
to the planet's core
and it isn't enough
they want more
Religions fall
children shelled
"...CHILDREN SHELLED?  THAT'S ALL
VERY WELL, BUT WOULD YOU 
PLEASE KEEP THE NOISE
DOWN LOW?
BECAUSE YOU'RE WAKING
THE LAZY SUNBATHERS..."
