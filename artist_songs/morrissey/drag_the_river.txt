Drag the river and within her you may find a sliver
Of the one of whom you speak and whom they seek
she would gaze into the river as we’d look into a mirror

And her reflection would beckon her to
Join me join me join me join me
Happy we will be

On the coastal shore I’m sure you’d break down if you saw
And abhorrent torrent crashing as it pours
The counter current holds a secret at the rise of tides

And it swells all alone for this heart born too high
So join me join me join me join me
I’m certain I heard her cry

By the river with the soul of submersible stone
Every second of my life prepares to go
She would call into the river as she’d cry out for her mother

So stark, so haunt, deep enough for all I was
Oh join us join us join us join us
And happy we will be
