The one I love is standing near
The one I love is everywhere
I can woo you
I can amuse you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud
The one I love roosts in the mind
Can snap this spell
Or, increase hell
I can chase you and I can catch you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud
Oh, black cloud
Oh, black cloud
I play the game of Favorites now
I can I must I will I do
I can please you
Or, I can freeze you out
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud, black cloud
I can choke myself to please you
And I can sink much lower than usual
But there's nothing I can do
To make you mine
