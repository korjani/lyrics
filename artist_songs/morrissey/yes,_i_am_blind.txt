Yes, I am blind
no, I can't see the good things
just the bad things
Yes, I am blind
no, I can't see
there must be something
horribly wrong with me?
Love's youg dream
I'm the one who shopped you
I'm the one who stopped you
'cause in my sorry way I love you
Love's young dream
aren't you sorry for what you've done?
well, you're not the only one
and in my sorry way I love you
Yes, I am blind
but I do see
Evil people prosper
over the likes of you and me
ALWAYS
Little lamb on a hill
run fast if you can
good Christians want to KILL you
and your live has not even begun!
