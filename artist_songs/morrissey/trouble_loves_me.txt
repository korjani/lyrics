Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round
