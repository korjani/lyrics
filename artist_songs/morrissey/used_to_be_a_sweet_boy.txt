Used to be a sweet boy
holding so tightly
to Daddy's hand
but that was all
in some distant land
Blazer and tie
and a big bright healthy smile
used to make all
of our trials worthwhile
Used to be a sweet boy
and I'm not to blame
but something went wrong
something went wrong
and I know
I can't be to blame
