Moonriver 
Wider than a mile 
I'll be crossing you in style 
Someday 
Oh, Dreammaker 
You heartbreaker 
Wherever you're going 
I'm going your way 
Two drifters 
Off to see the world 
I'm not so sure the world 
Deserves us 
We're after 
The same rainbow's end 
How come it's just around the bend? 
It's always just around the bend? 
[repeat]
