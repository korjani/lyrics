It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
And once again I turn to you
Once again I do I turn to you
It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
I'm the same underneath
But this you, you surely knew

Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And if you don't know this
Then what do you know?
Every second of my life I only live for you
And you can shoot me
And you can throw me off a train
I still maintain
I still maintain
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
But I'm still the same underneath
This you surely knew
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you anymore

Can you please stop time?
Can you stop the pain?
I feel too cold
And now I feel too warm again
Can you stop this pain?
Can you stop this pain?
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
