I was bored in a fjord

And I curse the heart and soul 
Of Scandinavia

Let the people burn 
Let their children cry and die 
In blind asylums

But then you came along 
And you held out your hand 
And I fell in love with you 
And Scandinavia

I kiss the soil 
I hug the soil 
I eat the soil 
And I praise the God who made you

Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia 
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia

Pinned to a crime in Trondheim 
I despise each syllable In Scandinavia

Let the people burn 
Let their children cry and die 
In blind asylums

But then you came along 
And you held out your hand 
And I fell in love with you 
And Scandinavia

I kiss the soil 
I hug the soil 
I eat the soil 
And I praise the God who made you

Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia 
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia
