Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW
