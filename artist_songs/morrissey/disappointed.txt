Our unsleepable friend
gets the message on an ill-wind
'all your friends and your foes
would rather die than have to touch you'
TO SAY THE LEAST: truly disappointed
truly, truly, truly
Drank too much
said too much
and there's nowhere to go - but Down
young boy - I wanna help you
SEE THESE LINES?: truly disappointed
truly, truly, truly
Don't talk to me now
about people who are "nice"
'cause I have spent my WHOLE LIFE
in RUINS...
because of people who were "nice"
This world may lack Style, I know
but each bud must blossom and grow
Young girl one day we really will be old
but the thing is: I love you NOW
This is the last song I will ever sing
No I've changed my mind again
GOODNIGHT
AND THANK YOU
