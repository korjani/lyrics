Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...
