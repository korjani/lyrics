What would you do for a dollar?
I know you want something to do, my darlin'
Wouldn't you like to have some money to spend?
What would you do with my money now?
Do you see yourself in diamonds
Do you see yourself in diamonds
Probably not (Probably not)
Take it to the store and get a Coke
Or some tall boys, a pack of smokes and a can of spray paint

Down by the giant drainpipe
Light firecrackers while we crack cans of beer
And if those boys aren't skating there
Maybe we can paint pentagrams and pot leaves along the walls

You fell down, now you should get up
No-one cares that your knees got cut up
After all it's just a little blood
And you don't have nice clothes anyway
You don't have anything that's nice at all
And you need a new asthma inhaler

Down by the giant drainpipe
Light firecrackers while we crack cans of beer
And if those boys aren't skating there
Down by the giant drainpipe
Light firecrackers while we crack cans of beer
And if those boys aren't skating there
Maybe we can paint pentagrams and pot leaves along the walls

I'll see you by the water
We can hang out all night long

Or some tall boys, a pack of smokes and a can of spray paint
Light firecrackers while we crack cans of beer
And if those boys aren't skating there
Down by the giant drainpipe
Light firecrackers while we crack cans of beer
And if those boys aren't skating there
