Life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
Used to put the cars in my baby mama's name
4 A.M. for breakfast we was cookin' cocaine, now it's lunches
Brunches, interviews by the fuckin' pool
No security, I'm solo with my fuckin' tool
Niggas tweetin' 'bout a murder, bust a fuckin' move
If we comin' through, we leave their bodies on the fuckin' news
Channel 7, Channel 2, Channel 5, nigga
Hit me up, I bet my homies down to ride, nigga
And it's just how this shit go where I reside, nigga
Welfare, food stamps, how we survive, nigga
Yeah, I guess it's hard for me to shake this
Automatic, bad habit, help me break this
Rollin' through, my shooters war up and face shit
Crack rock, straight base, ain't shit to play with, yeah, nigga
Uh, yeah
Crack rock, straight base, ain't shit to play with, yeah, nigga

And it feels like I'm not really gettin' through
And it feels like I'm not really gettin' through
And it feels like I'm not really gettin' through
Yo what's up?

[Stevie Wonder:]
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
I never dreamt of making my dreams come true
I never dreamt of making my dreams come true
