If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because I'm me
Because she said, "He's the one that drill the charms
Honey let's go wrong"
I just want to know
What's wrong with me?
Being in love with you

[Camp Lo:]
Yeah
9th grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
[?] only Django
[?]
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A come back, flat black paint on a Chevy

If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because I'm me
Because I'm me
Because I'm me

[Camp Lo:]
Never mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony
Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out baby

I just want to know
What's wrong with me?

"Watch the shit, it's good"
