(Colours, colours)
(Wonderful, wonderful colours)
(Oh, colours!)

After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart

Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play
I wanna join you in the urban surf
And learn to love you in a neon way
Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play
I wanna join you in the urban surf
Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play
I wanna join you in the urban surf
And learn to love you in a neon way

Over sea, under stone
No-one wants to be alone
Everybody's going somewhere
After dark and the bars are slow
Where do all the mermaids go?
Everybody's got there somewhere
Everybody knows it's somewhere

After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
