Put your hands in the air, let me know you out there

[Tyga:]

Rock out, that's Janis Joplin, she a red head no Dennis Rodman
Don't bullshit me, I'm a Red Bull sipper don't cut my wings
On the tail of the jet all you see is steam, gotta bad bitch nude in the front seat
She make it bounce, bring your body I bring an ounce
Don't chase pussy, that's cat and mouse
Every day I'm turnin' out

Hungover and I'm back out
White party and I'm blacked out
Black card that just maxed out

I'm about to just black out
