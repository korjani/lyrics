Well, it's how I see you
When I see you from below
And I feel no other
Sights or sounds of things I know

Only your glow,
Only your glow

So converse me without
Steady tone of where you've been
But I know that you're a
Timid love beneath the skin

Breaking you in,
Breaking you in

I don't know you,
But I know what you do
I don't know you,
But I know what you do

And I know you carry
A sense of weariness, I see
You're the one I'm wanting,
With the plainest clarity

Turning in me,
Burning in me

I don't know you,
But I know what you do
I don't know you,
But I know what you do

You'll never be sincerely right
If I stand here with you

And it's how I see you
When I see you from below
When I see you from below
When I see you from below
When I see you from below
