We only wake 'cause our eyes are open
Open so wide we walk in the dark
Trying so hard to keep what we're losing
Using our feet to show them the movements

And they wake up, and they go out
Head in a cloud

We were like them before we were older
Just like they're grow to be as we are
And still only speak with wording of caution
Sow and we reap what we're putting forward

And they wake up, and they go out
Head in a cloud

We can look down, see what we were
Shaking our fingers and using our words
We're all awake; we don't go out
Head in a cloud

Rush goes to the head it's all perception
I know, even so we all need time to grow
