Run, Run, Don't trail behind keep moving
The beasts wont stop till we're dead
All the scrapes on our knees 
Will tell you where we've been, where we have bled.

Oh we play, 
in autumn days

Won't lay down our heads till the day is won 
Won't stop running till we reach the sun 
Chasing all the things that are keeping us young
We won't stop running till we reach the sun 

Oh we're building a home
With the mud and the stones and the branches we bind
We're all just searching for something
Bigger than we're all able to find

Oh we play, 
in autumn days

Won't lay down our heads till the day is won 
Won't stop running till we reach the sun 
Chasing all the things that are keeping us young
We won't stop running till we reach the sun
