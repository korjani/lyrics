If the road of truth is fine
Which one of us is out of line?
Although you say you can prove it more
I can feel it down to my core
In a world where our word's gold
I sit and believe what I'm told
But in this blue world filled with bones
I'll just keep dancing on my own

(On my own, on my own…)

It's a useless waste of time
I don't care what's on your mind
The truth is never for us to find
We could lock horns all day
But really, who cares what we say?
We will be lost before we fade

I can almost hear it cry
This feeling that you somehow deny
Just how did you fail to hear
The roaring, grinding of your gears
Cause you didn't take the loss
Your future self honors the flaws
And some of us will rot awake
Watching you as you fix all your mistakes

But while you'll understand
Subtle movements of the land
Within the limits of these chains
There's only so much to explain
One day you will find this wall
The one that's infinitely tall
And as we move the hour hand
Are we just dancing in the sand?

It's a useless waste of time
I don't care what's on your mind
The truth is never for us to find
We could lock horns all day
But really, who cares what we say?
We will be lost before we fade
