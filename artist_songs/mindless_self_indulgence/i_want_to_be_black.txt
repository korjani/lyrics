I’m so white, you’re so black
Once I go black now I'm never going back
I’m so white, you’re so black
I wanna be at where you are at
I’m so white, you’re so black
My skin color is a minor setback
I’m so white, and you’re so black
I wanna trade 

From the palest gray to the darkest day
From the whitest light to the blackest night

I wanna be black like Malcolm X
I wanna be black I really mean it
I wanna be black like MLK
I wanna be black like Morgan Freeman
Set me free

I’m so white, you’re so black
Once I go black now I'm never going back
I’m so white, you’re so black
I wanna be at where you are at
I’m so white, you’re so black
My skin color is a minor setback
I’m so white, and you’re so black
I wanna trade

From the palest gray to the darkest day
From the whitest light to the blackest night

I wanna be black like Malcolm X
I wanna be black, I really mean it
I wanna be black like John Amos
I wanna be black like Morgan Freeman
Set me free

I will practice every day
Won’t be an embarrassment
I’ll get those subtleties down
All the way please let me in
To your club because I want to change
From the palest gray to the darkest day
From the whitest light to the blackest night.

I wanna be black, why can't you see?
I wanna be black, I really mean it
I wanna be black like MLK
I wanna be black like Morgan Freeman
Set me free

From the whitest light to the blackest night
