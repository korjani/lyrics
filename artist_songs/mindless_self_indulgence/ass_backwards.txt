(Hello, Children.
Would you like to hear a story? Well okay then.
Let me tell you a story about one motherfucker, two motherfuckers, three motherfuckers, four motherfuckers.
One motherfucker, two motherfuckers, three motherfuckers, they were born to roll.)

Well I rock and you roll
And I’m a stupid muthafucka
Goin’ outta control
I’m a break the English language with my four letter flow
I know you fucking hate it that’s what I’m paid for
‘Cause I roll and you rock and if you don’t fucking like it you can suck on my cock
You want to get on down I’m on fuck patrol
The lights are on but nobody’s home

Why can’t you just admit it that I’m better than you
You better just admit it ‘cause you know that it’s true
I’m gonna bring your world crashing down around you
I’m gonna fuck you up without further ado because
I go about things the wrong way baby
Ass backwards [x2]
I go about things the wrong way baby
Ass backwards [x2]

(Oh my. They’re having quite an adventure. Let’s turn the page and see what the fuck they do next.)

‘Cause I’m hard and you’re soft
I’m not only the client but I’m also the boss
Just like Pete Doherty and Kate Moss
I’m a hit rock bottom with a round of applause
‘Cause I’m soft and you’re hard and I’m the pussy wussy bugle boy from company retard
I shoulda quit this shit long ago but I can’t say no to all the fuckin’ dough

Why can’t you just admit it that I’m better than you
You better just admit it ‘cause you know that it’s true
I’m gonna bring your world crashing down around you
I’m gonna fuck you up without further ado because
I go about things the wrong way baby
Ass backwards [x2]
I go about things the wrong way baby
Ass backwards

(Oh my goodness.)
Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in [x8]
I go about things the wrong way baby [x3]
Ass backwards

(Well, that’s all for now. Goodnight, stupid children.)
