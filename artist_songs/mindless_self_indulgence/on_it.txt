Catastrophe
Imma kill a motherfucker with a fax machine and break... it down... for you... to see

On it - watch me bleed
On it - rest in peace
On it - h-h-hide
You are... So good so far [x2]

Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin'
Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin' (goin'-goin'-goin'-goin')

In the morning I'm gone
Putting you in your place

Rock the walls, rock the bass

On it - watch me bleed
