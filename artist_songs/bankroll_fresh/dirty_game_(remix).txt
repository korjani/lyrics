[Bankroll Fresh:]
You gotta keep your eyes open now, man
This shit is getting deep
Where my cup at?
You keep your eyes open nigga
Yeah

[Bankroll Fresh:]
See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to my main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes
Streets so fucked up, man this is dirty game
Drink drink, smoke smoke, just to ease the pain [x2]

[YFN Lucci:]
Gotta ease the pain, I just gotta ease the pain
I say I gotta change the game
Shit'll never be the same
They killed my brother for a lane
Pussy boy tryna get a name
Now we ride around tryna catch a stain
100 rounds, we tryna kill everything
These niggas wish they can pop shit like this
They hatin' cause a nigga getting it in
I hope you lil' niggas listening
I'm worth more, I just came in
I'm on tour, you know that back in
I'm in that big Benz, I gotta back in
Yeah, you know I usually ride with that Mac 10
I'm too short, get smoked like a Newport
They asked me who I do it for?
Now my nigga gotta go to court
Gotta roll some weed and smoke another joint
Fuck it nigga, roll another one
Last year I lost my brother Nut
Lost Muffin all over nothing
Aye

[Bankroll Fresh:]
See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to my main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes
Streets so fucked up, man this is dirty game
Drink drink, smoke smoke, just to ease the pain [x2]

I see my bitch change on me
My main bitch doing side things
My side bitch acting like my main
My main bitch tripping, going insane
I've been trying to keep it in the lane
I've been trying to keep it in the row
I've been trying pull up give and go
I've really trying not to explode
These niggas been tripping anyway
These niggas been tripping everyday
I've been trying to get money, getting paid
Trying getting money like my nigga Ace
Money Making Mitch, on some real shit
I like big money, so I pop big shit
I'm getting money so you niggas having bitch fits
I'm getting money so you niggas having bitch fits
Pull up nigga, I'm who your bitch with
Louie V nigga, like I left Dapper Dan
20-17, I'm a move to Amsterdam
These niggas hating, they gonna really need an ambulance
We toting K's like we come from Afghanistan
Whole hood wildin' out, like the Taliban
Get you ass wet for a whole pack of xans
I got Street Money, can't do nothing but win

See my close friend change, turned my side hoe to my main
Ridin' rear view every time I change lanes
Streets so fucked up, man this is dirty game
Drink drink, smoke smoke, just to ease the pain [x2]
