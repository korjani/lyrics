Need to wrap it, had to have it, Mathematics

Ballinnn on these Bitches Mannn...

[Chorus:]
I Ain't Never Had Shit

[Verse 2:]
Fucking money up
Couple hundred bucks
Crib a Milli plus
Furniture from Huff's
Man this shit plush
Flat Screen... Touch
Elevated Up
Silver sueded up
Camel cabled up
Counting paper up
Paper counting, got me counting paper cuts
Big Garage, It could fit a fucking bus
Bankroll ballin, he's going to fuck it up
Glass ceiling top peeling, what the fuck
Fuck is up
Mutha Fuck
Duel Master, it's a buck?
Hit the lot, pick a truck
AP glittered up, crystal'd up
Bezeled out, Filled it up, (Filled E'm up)
From the ground, Momma's house, build it up
Magazine, Filled it up
Pusssy Nigga play K, Rip your guts
Nigga What...
Street money
Keep money
Jeep running
Summer Time, skeet something
Two Hoes, and me something
Three Something (Threesome)
Bitch I'm cumming
Peace something...

Ohh He, the one with the racks on right now
Who me

[Chorus]
