I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas

Um-m-m, I should’ve knew, I should’ve knew
But I never in a million years expect this shit’ll come from you
Where the hate come from?
I thought it was love, I thought it was blood
Shit hurt me to the heart
Guess that ain’t what it was, that ain’t what it was
Niggas pillow talking like hoes
Back to back, acting like bitches
Niggas love you when you down
When you get money niggas started switching
I can see it nigga, I see you niggas, see you niggas
Scope on that motherfucker, 223 you niggas, 3 you niggas
See through ass niggas, your move phony, you niggas fake
Worried ‘bout another nigga’s business, why you worried ‘bout what I make?
Why you worried ‘bout my shit? Why you worried ‘bout my racks?
Why you worried ‘bout my pack? Why you worried ‘bout my sack?
Your bitch on my dick

I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas

Shit hurt me to my heart, shit hurt me to my heart
Shit hurt me to my heart, shit hurt me to my heart
Lord, I swear this shit lord
Would’ve drew my blood for you
I showed my blood for you
I showed my love for you
She ain’t do the same for who?
You did everything for who?
Nigga you made who?
Nigga you paid who?
Nigga we made you
Nigga was on your head nigga
We stayed you
We stayed down in silence
These niggas forgot about it
Real niggas listen to shit
Nigga hope you gain some knowledge
And one thing I learned
Nigga the streets don’t love nobody

I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
I can’t believe these niggas
