Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my fucking God

ATL ball Life
Might come through a stop light
New bands
Shit blue raped
Them New Hund's there on candler

Got fitty racks on me fuck it lets gamble
Boss up on these bitches
I'm raising my standards
Throwback barry sanders
Duce Duce with da hammer
Be true to you
Also kidnap you for ransom

I want da Beamer coupe
G sell a bean or two
Bring me two ninas through
Might throw a barbecue
Gucci on Gucci
Two G's on the goggles
I came from the bottom
Push start on the auto

Bankroll da logic book
Me at The Garden
That's way in New York
Nigga Brooklyn to Harlem

Harlem globe trotter trick
Trick off witcha partner
Yo bitch is a shopper
She scared of the doctor

Chew through the city in a helicopter
I'm smoking this shit up, a hippie a rasta

I'll fuck your bitch scratched her off of my roster

Off of my roster I'll stretch her no problem

Shirt Valentino, I'm bigger than Nino
All black El Camino I'm kicking that Lingo

Too many C Notes
I'm serving Gambino
I'm serving y'all mean though so run through your C notes

Tuck your shit in when we come in like Debo
You niggas here acting like Danny Devito
