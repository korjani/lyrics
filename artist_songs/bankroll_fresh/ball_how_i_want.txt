[Intro:]
I see the vision, nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
I'm a fly nigga, God put me in a Bentley
Put me in the kitchen, fuckin' with defenses
Fuckin' with the fishes, hand counting 60
Thumb through the 50, got 6 tens, that's a 60
Young nigga gon' be a millionaire
But these broke hoes ain't gettin' shit
Man, my bitch is a immigrant
She come from another distance
I pulled up in a instant
Talk to the car, it correspond
Say you wanna get it right now, nigga?
Better give me everything that you want

[Hook x2:]
Ball how I wanna, stunt how I wanna
Floss how I wanna, winter and the summer
Super trap mode, Forgiatos on 'em
Bitch I don't want ya, bitch I don't want ya
You can get ya ho, I don't want her, hey
You can get ya ho, I don't want her, hey
You can get ya ho, I don't want her, hey
You can get ya ho, I don't want her, gone

[Verse 2:]
Man, I don't want the bitch, you can have her back
Fake ass Berkin bag, dirty ass track
Ugly ass tummy tuck, bitch, you fat
Caked up make-up, bitch, get back
Bitch, please freeze, get on your knees
Bitch only call when the bitch in need
In everybody business, fuck yo' feelings
I'm ballin' hard, throwin' ones to the ceiling
Me and Zayto', bitch it's Bankroll
I got 50 grand, I'm a flex it on the hoes
VVS shinin', they cold, whoo
VVS in her earlobe, whoo
I'm gettin' money, it show
You a pussy nigga, you told
Real niggas stick to the code
Bitch, keep something? Hell no!
