Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
Think I'll just give in

Taking medication
Till my stomach's full
Neither side is sacred
Crawling in the hole

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps it clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Taken time is all but true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I can't give in

Taking medication
Till my stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
When I'm in my home

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps it clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Taken time is weird but true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
We all just give in

Taking medication
Till my stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
When I'm in my home

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps it clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Learn from history, all that’s true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again
