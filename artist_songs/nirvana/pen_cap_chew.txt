Oh lesser God
Oh loathe me

Oh oh ...

You get you get you get you get to me
Holy is the time its such an easy way to go
You get you get you get you get to be
Hide the struggle in the skin under a fingernail

[x2]
Oh lesser God
Oh loathe me
Oh lesser God
Oh your lonely

Waste your time by saving worthless gullables
Kill a Politician and then wear his clothes
This decade is the age of Re-hashing
Protest and then go to jail for Trespassing
Do you mean insane?

[x3]
Go Home ...
