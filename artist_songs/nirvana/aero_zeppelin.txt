What's a season in a right if you can't have anything
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything
What's the meaning in a crime, it's a fan if anything
Where's the learning in a line, it's a brand, it's a brand

How a culture comes again, it was all here yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
There's only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans

They'll be fans [alt: If you brand] [x3]

[x2]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways

Hey ... [x7]
