I'm long gone from vertical,
Somewhere south is stopping me
I'm long gone from the american dream,
You may decide it's something new
I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide it's not for you.

I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide there's nothing there

Hold it in your gut [x8] (Alt: Born in a junkyard)

I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide that it's not good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave,
You may decide on stopping me
I'm long gone but I'll let you lose,
You may decide it's something new
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave,
You may decide on stopping me.

Hold it in your gut [x8] (Alt: Born in a junkyard)
Gone!
