Hey, the love of two
A desire, is whats for you
is it real? A lulliby?
Face to face, with an unamed mouth
Hey! Hey! Heyyyy!  Hey! hey! Heyyyy!
Feel the spirit form, in his eyes was loving for
And his lion's were raging high, hunts himself & fears his ripe
Hey! Hey! Heyyyy!  Hey! Hey! Heyyyy!
Heyyyyyyyyyyy!
