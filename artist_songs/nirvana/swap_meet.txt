[x3]
They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show

Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
