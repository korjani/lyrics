Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I'd - rather be dead than cool
I don't know why - every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why - less is more, love is blind
I don't know why

Stay
Stay away [x3]

Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why - fashion shits, fashion style
I don't know why - throw it out and keep it in
I don't know why - have to have poison skin
I don't know why

Stay
Stay away [x3]

I don't why [x2]

Stay
Stay away [x3]

Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I'd - rather be dead than cool
I don't know why - every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why - less is more, love is blind
I don't know why

Stay
Stay away [x3]

I don't know why [x2]

Stay
Stay away [x3]

Stay away [x5]

God is gay!
