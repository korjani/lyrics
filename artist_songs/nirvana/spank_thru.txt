And as the soft pretentious mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
And the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily

We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby

I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
living without you girl you'll only break my heart ...

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it - I can shape it and/or mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it - I can spank it, I can beat it ejacu-late it ... Aah!
I've been lookin for day Glo - Always hearing the same ole'
Sticky boredom with a book -
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could
