Now that I got ya wantin me in the worst way
Thought I'd get freaky girl startin with some foreplay
Let me know if you're ready
Cause it's about to get dirty
Wanna have a party with your body and get you crunk
How do you like it
Tell now what you want
Ain't gonna stop til you're sweaty
Tonight baby I'm only gonna freak you

[Chorus:]
Wait a minute
Girl let me set the mood (set the mood)
Freak you freak you down to this interlude (this interlude)
I wanna play a little bit of N2U
Girl cause I'm into you
Don't you dare go there without me
Wait hold up now let it go
Girl, let me set the mood (set the mood)
Freak you freak you down to this interlude (this interlude)
Play a little bit of N2U
All while I'm doin you
Don't you dare go there without me
Wait hold up now let it go

Hit you with a dose
Of my body's explosive
Bring a little joy and pain
Just as long as you're happy
What will it take to get you rowdy
Your favorite CD is on and it's up real loud
I'm high off you love and I don't wanna come down
So brace yourself cause you're going 12 rounds
And after that we'll be sleeping sound

[Chorus]

The time has arrived for you to ride
I grab your neck
I grab your hips
Then grab your thighs
There's a sign on the door
It says don't interrupt
There's no getting up
Until I'm finished loving you

[Adlib and Chorus: to fade]
