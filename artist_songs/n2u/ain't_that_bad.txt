It's been a while ya trippin babe
How you wanna stay away
Missin you like crazy
Tell me what's the deal lady

Can we ease up this pain

This thing that we fought about
Ain't worth the love we talk about
We got a bond and it takes two to work it out

Can't give it up no way

I am made for you, you were made for me

You're soul is the most precious thing that I've held
We're connected here by faith, that's why you're my mate

Can we drop this now and just let this be

A perfect man what a goal would a perfect woman hold
Such a better though to the one who loves her

What I gotta do to make you smile
Cause you know I haven't seen you laughing in a while
Baby what we going through ain't that bad

What I gotta do to make ya see
When I'm hurting you I'm hurting every part of me
Tell me can we back that we had
What we going through ain't bad

I can role play if you learn to play a role
It's a fifty/fifty thing come on let's begin
We got behind so behind

We got things to see things and places to go
So much catching up to do baby girl come on
Let's be one again

What I gotta say to make you smile
Cause you know I haven't seen you laughing in a while
Baby what we going through ain't that bad

And what I gotta do to make ya see
When I'm hurting you I'm hurting every part of me
Tell me can we back that we had
What we going through ain't bad

Can we try to make things right
What I gotta say to make you smile
Baby tell me
Oh oh oh baby

What I gotta do to make you smile
Cause you know I haven't seen you laughing in a while
Baby what we going through ain't that bad

What I gotta do to make ya see
When I'm hurting you I'm hurting every part of me
Tell me can we back that we had
What we going through ain't bad

What I gotta do to make you smile
Cause you know I haven't seen you laughing in a while
Baby what we going through ain't that bad
