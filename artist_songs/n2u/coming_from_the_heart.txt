Don't even wanna think about it think about losing you come on now just forget about it I don't no wat I'll do your the color in my picture the reason for my song your my sun light in early dawn (ummmm) everyday that I wake up it like I blessed all over again (oooo yea) to spend another day with you let's me know how blessed I am (I am) and no matter what we been through you never ran away wat I'm really trying to say

[Chorus:]
It's coming from the heart all this things I say are real don't no where to start because everything you do fulfills breaks my every wish didn't know we'll be like this, this is coming from the heart coming from the heart

[Verse 2:]
Are love is like the mountain I can't believe the clouds so high it coming from the heart and if we keep on claiming (claiming babe) I think we could touch the sky (ooo it coming the heart) should the world ever stop turning I would still love you (yea I will) every word I say is true (ooo)
