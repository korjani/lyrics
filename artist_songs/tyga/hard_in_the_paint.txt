Uh, I ain't never been cheap
I spend it all
Never made varsity, but I fucking ball
Fourteen? Fuck school I'm a rapper dog
Snapback boy, take that fucking fitted off!
Fall to their knees
Plead for their right to breathe
Lord please devour all my enemies!
That was Pac talkin'
Bitch now back up off me
I'm that yellow gold boss and you looking Boston
Walk the water if I could bitch I think I'm Moses
Tell them shut the fuck up! with all that commotion
Counting money get enough
Get a promotion
I'm sizzlin' up hotter than a bowl of momma porridge
Whole body covered in green like dinosaurs
Get me neck baby bend all your spinal cords
Uh, goofy ass goofy goofy
Tryin'a blend in like a mothafucka smoothie
Take a seat you fucking up the movie
I'm on the couch standing while you staring at the movement
Young Money bitch I do this!
Hand in the mind, both sides, one lie, two crimes other side don't fire
Fully dazed like a dream
I ain't moving bitch we groovin'
Rell said it's 5 Duece Hoover, fully trippin I could prove it (uh)
Switch blade where ma boot is
All that sweet talk leave a nigga to-toothless
Now u goofy
I'm a asshole
And ma car doofus
Mikey rock chucks like cool kids (bitch)
It so dangerous
Haters envy me cause they ang-ry
So if you want that beef
Then the bitch then I'm arranging it
More famous then these no name niggas that you hanging with
All my homies on like the cables is
Sa-Sa-Say go
Watch TV Tyga psycho
Don't play Tycho
50 tyson I'll bite you
No license, still drivin
Use to lease now I buy it
Ho cash blood diamonds
Niggas violent, babies crying
Mr nice guy (nice guy)
Come sell the product
I'm a nice guy (nice guy)
But I never went to college (hahaha)
Can't live long in the imagination
Don't compare to no basic
Bitch I'm better
Stop debatin' mothafucka
Mo-mothafucka
