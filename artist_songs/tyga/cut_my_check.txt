Drop your hands into your lap and relax

[Bridge:]
Been around the world seen with the best (with the best)
My kicks you haven't seen them yet (not yet)
Where the girls just looking for the sex (the sex)
Throw your hands from the east to the west (to the west)

[Hook:]
Tell them all just cut my check (my check)
Tell them all just cut my check (my check)
Tell them all just cut my check (my check)
Tell them all just cut my check (my check)

Look rappers, I'm tell you what's about to happen
As I add up, your money is mathematics
As an animal, Dracula out of his casket
Who's hungry [?]
Who matters I'll make them unmatter
Batter batter I throw money, stripper catch it
They mad happy
No meal, I'm Christmas deal
[?]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Hear hear hear this that real weird
I'm going to steer steer this with the e-gear
Might appear in the shape of a shark fin
Signal the docks that I'm hot and I'm heartless
Gorilla bar mitzvahs, ape when the record spins
[?]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Tyzilla, welcome to the thriller
Shimmer on my neck but I bet it ain't glitter
King of the poppa, pop killa killa
Middle of the [?] will I get my sizzle
Hot hot man, God God God, damn
Girl grab me but I melt through her hands
Land of LA, Cali where they bang
I'm just a star that never change

[Bridge]

[Hook]
