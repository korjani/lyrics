Nigga's honey make you desert, wash it down with some liqour
Li-lit up, the pill make a bitch turn flipper
You so um, all on the bottom of my zipper

Pinocchio rappers man, all I see is liars (Ahh!)
Rough riders, gang niggas, kush buyers
Get smashed, Halloween, Mike Myers
My religion, plenty women no choirs
They call me the royal penis, they're highness
For when they give it up, pour it up, leave it wit' us
Eatin' my dust, you bustas dusty still on the bus
Truly quick, pick her up or you ain't bad, you ain't nothing
All my niggas eatin' like the last supper, nigga
