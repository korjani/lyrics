I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma stop
And I wake up every morning
Like where am I
Where am I

My deadbeat love what he does
For release are kiss and hugs
They offer drugs off to clubs
Cigarettes smoking some bube
But what he does none above
Just watching them drunk is fun
Gotta get buzzed
No groupie love on the tour bus
Knockin on wood take her to the woodshop
Pop plenty much
Livin in this fixer up
Plus the air conditioner sucks
Driver drivin' slow hard this tolls slippery roads now I’m just wishing
I was back at home

I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

Half asleep but still I dream
Wishing she was next to me
But I don’t gotta girlfriend
Tonight Miss Ouri Ashley
She will be come lay with me
We can watch some MTV
Flipping through some magazines
Look it’s me, don’t look at me
I’m to bright to see luminous, don’t you agree?
A man ain’t nothing
'til that man out hustling
Gurl trying to get me busted
Cleand or something sayin
I'm in trouble cops lookin for the suspect (what you say?)
Well fuck 'em Cuz I..

I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

Shit, we doing a hundred
I don’t think this prevost is made for it
Feeling the three wheel motion any minute bus flip over
And we’ll be rolling in the road found dead in Oklahoma
Only hung over so he doesn’t notice what’s approaching
Oh shit, here comes eighteen wheeler towing
I’m ready to jump out this motherfucker, driver please let door open
Shit is hopeless
Getting closer
Eyes closing
Collision notices
In the ocean floating where the boats is
Thank god told at least

I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

Genesis 24:56
Do not detain me, now that the lord has granted success to my journey
Send me on my way
So I may go to my master
