How's it feel to watch your bank account go from a zero
To a million, I can tell you 'bout the feeling, I can tell you not
Build for this shit, my nigga you should leave the building
Cause when we in the building you gotta be built for real shit
Real life death threats cause of my icy necklace, what
You want my chain, will that take away your pain, fuck it
Take my watch, my rings and my Range
My 10 million dollar mortgage, you still the same lame
Motherfucker that ain't want it bad as I did, you ain't rap like I did
You just say it how you want, but when we talking platinum nigga voice [?]
Born and raised in L.A, we was 'Boyz N tha Hood'
Yeah, I been turnt up, I been the noise in the hood
Boys with the boys, jumping out on boys from the bush
Yeah, now the hardest choice I make is which one should I push
The Bentley or the Roll Royce, I grew up and got [?]

I'm forever 'bout whatever yeah we ready for war
I ain't dancing on the dope, what I'm selling is pure
You fascinated with the flow I'm masturbating
I'm stroking my ego, we know you mad I made it
Being broke'll make you evil, the love of money will do the same
Who to blame, either way I need a new Bugatti
You been hating for a minute you need a new hobby
You ain't getting paid off that shit, you better lay off that shit, bruh
I fell in love making it rain on that bitch bruh
Fell outta love I can't complain about that shit tho
You see my son yeah he the best of me, give him all the good of me
Give y'all what's left in me, uh
Appetite for destruction, I got the recipe
Everybody eats, but we'll get to that later, let's get to this paper
Cause you ain't doing shit 'til you get to these haters
Am I getting to you niggas, you getting rich off hating?
Shit, then tell me how's it feel to watch your bank account go from a zero
To a million, I can tell you 'bout the feeling, I can tell you not
Build for this shit, my nigga you should leave the building
Cause when we in the building you gotta be built for real shit
Real life death threats I'm the overnight success what
You want my fame, will that take away your pain, fuck it
Take my watch, my ring and my Range
My 10 million dollar mortgage, you still the same lame
Motherfucker that ain't want it bad as I did, you ain't rap like I did
Ain't have to scrap like I did, ask them niggas from the set you ain't get back like I did
When they lying on you sit back and laugh like I did
Was my whole career you idea, why they hate me nigga I have no idea
Back when I had no I.D they knew my name, all I ever knew how to do was do my thing
Hate me now, motherfucker
