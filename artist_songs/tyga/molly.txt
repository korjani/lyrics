[Intro:]
Hi - I am looking for Molly
I've been searchin' everywhere and I can't seem to find...
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Bands all in my dollars
I'm everywhere, it's poppin'
Can't fall in love, I got options
I'm high school, that's college
King gold chains, that's Notre Dame
That green, yeah, I got it
I show up in the party
Like "where the fuck that molly?"
OD, we're OGs
We don't fuck with no police
I'm too fly to be low key
Them 24 inch Kobes
All black, that's yours to see
She give me pussy, that's your seed
Broke niggas, stop beggin' me
Cause that's the shit that I don't need
I'm swervin', I'm drivin'
Ain't got time to be tired
I'm superturnt, don't try me
Killin' your mind off and fuckin' your body
Bitch want a flick? Pose for my posse
Got too much shit to worry about gossip
I'm on a bad trip and...

[Hook:]
I can't seem to find...
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Lil' bitch, my section is important - my new car's imported
My bank account is enormous - weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it - she poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it - if I want it I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds - gotta press "Up" to see us
I've got a whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never, ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I make then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary, and...

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mally Mall]
Put it in my drink - put it in my drink
Put it in my drink - you already know
Put it in my drink - put it in my drink
Put it in my drink - you already know
She had me smokin', had me smokin'...
Smokin' on my reefer
She had me smokin', she had me smokin'...
Smokin' on my reefer

[Hook]
