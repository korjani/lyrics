And a Bentley truck? Bout 100,000

Diamonds flooded
Holy water blessed me like our father
Witness my faith, burned believers die, make you a martyr
Keep a laser, Han Solo, snakes leather, I'm focused
Add it up nigga, add it up
Bag it up, what's the fuckin' total?
I just opened new accounts (I see the snakes)
No piggy bank, just large amounts (I see the snakes)
I just switched the license plate
My lawyer said that I beat the case (I'm gonna beat the case)
Ruby Tuesdays Wraith
Arm and Hammer Maybach leather
Cocaine on her face, we just made a triple X movie
Payrolls in the safe, indoor jacuzzi
Outdoor jacuzzi
She gon' pop that coochie

Pinky rings on every ring, way you see me go bling-bling
Real shit I'm so honest (I see the snakes)
Sunset on my Pac shit (I see the snakes)
Tattoos in the videos (I see the snakes)
Designer, lookin' like a Gucci store
Paparazzi flash
Nabbin' bitches, bouncin' that ass

Just gave away all my Louie (and got it Gucci)
