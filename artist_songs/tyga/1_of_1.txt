You, you my only one
You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one, and I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

Back to the front with you
Don't let em make you regret it
They'll be fake if you let em
Don't let em make less out of something
That means so much to you
I wanna make you feel comfortable
Girl you know I fuck with you
Like summer school and Lunchables
We the untouchable, yeah
You don't have to suffer, no, yeah
I was made custom for you
Only giving my love in to

You, you my only one

I wanna go one on one with you
One on one, and I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

Take the thug in me and put some in you
Now you wearing bandanas
Rocking your man's flannels
Flight to Dubai, gotta pop a Xanax
Mi no love for dem batty bwoy antics
Gon make me pull choppers out the attic
I'm a savage, straight savage
Yeah, they laughed at my dreams of living lavish
We no pretender, we both remember
All these hoes was ghost fore I had the Phantom
Fore I had the Gram, I couldn't get at em
Uh, before I rock rings like Saturn
They ain't wanna hang out, wanna try to plan it
That's why I give all I have to you
They don't know I got the juice, they don't know
They don't know I touch money like masseuse
Dem don't know, I was made custom for you
Only giving my love in to

You, you my only one
You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one, and I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

Back to the front with you
Yeah, grind and bump with you
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
Don't have to front, it's true
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
