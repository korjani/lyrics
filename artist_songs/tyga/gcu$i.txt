Ghetto contour untamed sophisticated ignorance
Never heard nobody, nobody nah nah nah

I know it's hot and this ice don’t help
Yeah this ice that I got is the kind that don't melt
(Hold on let this shit keep goin')
Yeah I be cooler than I look

And everytime I come around, they say the summer's back
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
But are you really? (Are you really?)
Are you really ready? To get high and sweaty
