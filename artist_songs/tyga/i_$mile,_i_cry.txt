I smile, I cry
In love I fall
I’ve won, I’ve lost
And I’ll do it all again
This is who I am
Who I am
All I got
It’s all I need

Started out wit zero
Just a fist full of tear
Just a pad and a pencil
As I scribbled down my fears
Screaming out I'm ready to die
That's a lie. I ain't going nowhere
Till all my niggas get a Benz
I'm sitting in the crib with the miraculous view
I FaceTime my little man, you know daddy miss you
But I gotta rock this tour and get this mortgage
Smile for us mama, damn you so supportive
So make sure I'm cleared, no distortion
I know we used to argue but you'll always be important
Don't cry for me
Looking out the window, flying over Miami
All bottles prolly poppin' but I'm turned in my album
Get amnesia when they ask
"Who you got your style from?"
You niggas make me laugh till I cry
Scared to use your voice, all you have is your sight
A blogger’s gon’ blog, a baller’s gon' ball
Charge it to the game and get it in the lane and take the charge
72 and 10
I guess you can't win 'em all
Till my niggas hold on like you waiting on the car
And if you fall its my fault. Shit you know I got you

I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall
(You know I got you)
I've won, I lost
(Ugh you know I got you)
And I'll do it all again
(I do it like I got to)
This is who I am
(Ugh you know I got you)
(Yeah you know I got you)
Who I am
(You know I got you)
All I got is all I need
(I do it like I got to)

Ugh, pressure make diamonds
I put pressure all the times
So, I'm always at the jeweler getting fresher all the time
Time for a white suede happy to see me shine
Got me crying on your shoulder, Rawwest Nigga Alive
Superb, stand up guy, tallest nigga alive
GQ Party Chateau Marmont
Saint Laurent suit, I had to show my mind
Pull up in the phantom, cameras know my car
Now you looking like me, bitch stole my look
Never played by the book
You see the shows I've booked
Money over bitches, see the hoes I shook
It was long cold nights on the road I took
All the shit I kicked, I should soak my foot
Don't cry for me, hear my flow you know I'm good
Ugh yeah you know I'm good
Cause a blogger's gon' blog, a baller's gon' ball
Check the names in the hall, see my name on the wall
You see everything I do
Matches everything I talk
I swear the summer's mine
And I never let you fall
And if you fall, it's my fault
You know I got you

I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall
(You know I got you)
I've won, I lost
(Ugh you know I got you)
And I'll do it all again
(I do it like I got to)
This is who I am
(Ugh you know I got you)
(Yeah you know I got you)
Who I am
(You know I got you)
All I got is all I need
(I do it like I got to)
