She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to twirly swirly, in my vanilla coupe
She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof
She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too
I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm ridin' through

She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
All these money hungry hungry hippos wanna love me
All these diamonds dusty, mine just clear and sunny
I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly
I'm in the ghetto, the gutter, I got the sugar the butter
I got the mama the brother, oh yeah your son is a hustler
She wanna fuck and suck, but I ain't gon' rush it
I'm the ice cream man, I ball every summer
These boys wanna run it, that's cool cause I need more runners
Tell 'em get me more condoms, we doin' more fuckin'

She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to twirly swirly, in my vanilla coupe
She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof
She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too
I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm ridin' through

Banana clip, bandana tied around my head
Bandana bread we gettin' fed
I like my pie a la mode
She instagramming a move, a pic of me and my goons
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly
I'm in Saint Laurent candy paint Ferrari, baby lick this caramel
Bathing ape that camo, I came with an army
She wanna fuck then suck me, I think it's Sunday Monday
Tuesday I be busy, Wednesday I be out the country
When the club is jumpin' tell them niggas cut the bungee
Tell 'em cut the check, my number's jumpin'

She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to twirly swirly, in my vanilla coupe
She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof
She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too
I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm ridin' through
