Spreading terrorism through the music 
Rebelling against all this bullshit 
Fire is the heat that burns deep inside 
Raging and out of control 

Spreading terrorism through the music 
Rebelling against all this shit 
Energy in the purest form 
Controlled chaos, bring it on... 

Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy 
Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy 

Spreading terrorism through the music 
Rebelling against all this bullshit 
Urban guerillas on the front line 
Arm in arms, bring it on... 

Rise, rise, rise 
Above this bullshit 
Rise, rise, rise 
Above this bullshit 

"Night will come and I will follow 
For my victims no tomorrow" 
"Non-conformity in my inner self 
Only I guide my inner self" 

Bring da pain to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill 
Bring da rage to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill 
Bring da shit to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill 
Bring da pain to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill...
