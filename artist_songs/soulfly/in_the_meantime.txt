Earth tone suits you
so give it a smile
if I could hold your feet down
get to know for awhile

to make due is a promise
hard to keep without help
never taught to look in
I'm too concerned with my health

help me spread right, ash is
cow fertilized
come down in a feed town
strength to minimize

hold it

in the meantime
