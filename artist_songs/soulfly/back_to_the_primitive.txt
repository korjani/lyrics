Um, dois, tre^is, quatro... 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
We got our life to live 
The way we want to be 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
"Who feels it, knows it" 
(Bob Marley) 
And God will guide me 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your bullshit 
We're back to set it free 
Confronting the negative 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all you wannabes 
You don't mean shit to me 
Let it bleed... 

(tribal) 
Primitive 
Primitive 
Primitive 
Primitive 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
We got our life to live 
The way we want to be 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
How it used to be 
Check your reality 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
Fuck all you wannabes 
Aaaaaarggghhh! 

Back to the primitive 
Fuck all your politics 
Forever we will be 
What we want to be 

Primitivo
