Impaled bodies, impaled souls
Treacherous the unknown
Skinned alive and left to die
Inner fear comes to life

Cannibal holocaust
Hope is lost, all is lost
Cannibal holocaust
Hope is lost, all is lost

Tribal war... jungle law
Innermost... denial
Self-inflikt... devour
Till nothing remains

Cannibal holocaust
Hope is lost, all is lost
Cannibal holocaust
Hope is lost, all is lost

Sharpening the spears
The fire eaters
Even the jungle
Wants him dead
Snake worshippers
Into oblivion
Even hell
Wants him dead!!!

Discorporated, asphyxiated
Discolorated skin
Retaliation, retribution
Join the ministry of filth
Hung, drawn and quartered
Confluence, emptiness
Suicidal scorn
The neuro-axis stains

Cannibal holocaust
Enter the slaughterhouse
Cannibal holocaust
Enter the slaughterhouse...
