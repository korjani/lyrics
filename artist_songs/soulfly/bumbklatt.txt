Grow tha fuck up you waste
Can't you see what it takes
To be a real man
Talking shit all your life
No integrity or pride
Fucking mind full of lies

You fake
You waste
You bumbklaatt...

Now I know why
I turn my back on your life
And watch your envy arise
Now it's been so long
Yeah, you still won't grow up
And you never belong

So fuck you and your friends
I got time for revenge
And you ain't got tomorrow
So fuck you and your friends
Cause they still are the same
And your bullshit remains...
