What goes around comes around
You better realize
You kill life, you kill life
Why? Why?
I see your eyes, I see your lies
I see you hide, inside...

What goes around comes around
Now it's your time
How long can you lie?
How long can you hide?
How long can you live with your soulbleed?
How long can you live with your soul...

Bleed Bleed Bleed Bleed Bleed Bleed

What goes around comes around
No more lies
You kill life, you kill life
Why? Why?
I see a mother cry
I see a brother cry

Bring it on
Bring it

I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now
Muthafucka

I got my pride and that's all I need
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio
Don't take advantage of this process
You might have to digest a blade made for your ass to fade
I'm living on instinct
Never think when I'm rushin bones crushin
When I put your sorry ass in a package
You piece of shit sealed and delivered from a savage
And now you sweat because you're goin down
You envious clown fuckin' bleed
