On both banks of the river, red obsidian,
Heavy smoke
Leather slings, feathered arrows, many
Deities carried off in ropes
Big drums, small wagers, cold daggers, lambs
But all goes very quiet at the sudden shifting
At the sudden shifting of the sand

Fear and loathing
Highway burning
We come to scalp your souls
Trench warfare
Demolition
Unleash the dogs of war

Fuel injected suicide machine
Animal instinct, killing disease
Hell on Earth I inflikt
The world is burning
The sky is falling

Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla
Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla

Failed crusaders roam the land
Hearts of Wind, lungs of sand

Fuel injected - Suicide machine
Animal instinct - Killing disease

Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla
Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla

Sanctuary burning
Looting and pillaging
Killing and screaming
Punishing coming
Brain washing
Death dealing
Pain inflikting
Terror bringing
Devil's breathing
Face smashing
Bomb blasting
Thunder roaring...

Failed crusaders roam the land
Hearts of Wind, lungs of sand

I am defected
Nuclear head
Follow me till the end
I was rejected
Children septic
Human flesh I ate

Fuel injected - Suicide machine
Animal instinct - Killing disease

Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla
Ayatollah of Rock'n'rolla

The stars quickened westward, the broken
Beast charge away
Speaking of the Angles that many years ago
Fell upon the plain
Covenant, Vengeance, the mortality of Men
Another day at the doorstep begging Mercy
Before the palace of the Djinn
