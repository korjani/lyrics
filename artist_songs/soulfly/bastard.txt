Judas… Liar... Judas… Liar...
Judas… Liar... Judas… Liar...

You keep saying lies, pretending that you're right
I see through you disguise, I'll see to your demise
You can fool some people, some time…
But you cannot fool all the people, all the time…

Why don't you stop your bullshit, stop fucking around
You're just betraying yourself and looking like a clown
You hurt so many people I can't keep the count
Why don't you face yourself and turn your life around…

No more lies, no more lies
I cannot take your lies
Kill the lies, kill the lies
Now it's eye for an eye…
