Rome B.C.
Brutality
The arena of carnage and sin
Man and beast
Kill again
Everybody is going insane...

Hail Caesar...
Hail Caesar...
Hail Caesar...
Gladiator

Born in bondage
Kept in chains
Train to face the wrath of any man
Rome slave
Breeding hate
And dreams of freedom some day

Hail Caesar...
Hail Caesar...
Hail Caesar...
Gladiator

Born in bondage
Bleeding chains
Gladiator will rise again
Born slave
Born dead
Gladiator rise from the dead

Bloodsport, bloodfight
Execution comes tonight
Warrior, killer
Blood and sand will unite

Born slave, born dead
Execution of the dead
Warrior, Killer
Slaughter of the sinners

Hail... Hail... Hail... Gladiator
Hail... Hail... Hail... Gladiator
Gladiator... Hail!
