Prophecies unfolding
Armageddon coming
Sanctuaries burning
Revelation screaming
Ritual beginning
Sacrifices starting
Prophecies unfolding
Armageddon calling

Calling all the warriors
Come to war, now...
Calling all the warriors
Armagediztan... [2x]

Insurgents penetrating
In an ill civilization
Lurid reality
Means confrontation
Mutilation, the only solution
The Armageddon, the Revolution

Calling all the warriors
Come to war, now...
Calling all the warriors
Armagediztan... [2x]

Nihilistic tribes, vengeance is mine
Nihilistic tribes, vengeance is mine
Armageddon time, the world is blind
Armageddon time, the world is blind

AAARRRGGGHH!!! WARMAGEDDON!!!

Hostility crashes in the hands of doom
Reality and karma, burn as one
Cities collapsing, temples falling
Welcome to Armagediztan

Calling all the warriors
Come to war, now...
Calling all the warriors
Armagediztan... [2x]

Armageddon!!!
