I see the Red Sea part in front of me
I see the desert clouds bleed above me
I'm with the prophets on the final destiny
We'll fight the heathens and the ghost enemy

This is the prophecy
This is the prophecy

I see the money beggars on the last temptation
We're marching now through the devastation
I'm with the prophets on a mission of salvation
Cities falling, nations falling nations

This is the prophecy
This is the prophecy

I see the new millennium tribal warfare
I see them blind sheep going nowhere
The new exodus, just like they said
I see the crown of thorns, you know I was there

This is the prophecy
This is the prophecy

I see the times in this Armageddon
I see the flag of the conquering lion
I must reach the mountains of Zion
I'm with the prophets and the prophecy goes on

This is the prophecy
This is the prophecy

New millennium tribal war
New millennium tribal war
New millennium tribal war
New millennium tribal war
