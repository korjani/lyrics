Material things can't conquer me
Matter nothing to me, only your soul can be free
When we connect, spiritually
I feel you never went away from me
Waking up and I freak

Now it's so hard to breathe
Blood, sweat, and my tears
Make the fear disappear

Now that you are gone
I try staying strong

All these painful years
All these fallin' tears
Will never bring you back
Bring you back to me

I know one day I'll see you again
I know this can't be the end
I know you'll be there waiting for me
Waiting for me

Carry on
Stay strong
Carry on...

Now that you are gone
All these painful things
That make us bleed inside
I try staying strong
I just want to see you
I just want to see you
Dana
Moses
Watch me
Watch me

Oh God, take the pain away
I'll give you my life instead
Oh God, take the pain away
For you, my life I'll trade
Waking up and I freak
Now it's so hard to breathe
Blood, sweat, and my tears
Make the fear disappear

Now that you are gone
I try staying strong

Carry on
Stay strong
Carry on...
