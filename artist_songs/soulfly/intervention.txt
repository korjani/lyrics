Fight back
Attack
Let them all know that we're back
Collapse
Attract
And feel the knife at your back

Intervention - Violation
Desecration - Intervention

War act
A fact
The government will crash
It's now
It's dead
Nobody can bring them back

Intervention - Violation
Desecration - Intervention

Pain - Never go away
Hate - Remains the same
They - They will know my name
Slay - The government decay

Reality - The fall of morality
Inner cities corrupted by greed
A Roman Empire falls to their knees
Intervention the only reality

Pain - Never go away
Hate - Remains the same
They - They will know my name
Slay - The government decay

Now war
Will fall
The sky will bleed the new storm
Act now
For all
Enter your downfall

Intervention - Violation
Desecration - Intervention

Bloodstorm...
Onslaught...
Torture...
Martyr...
