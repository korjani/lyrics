I can't wait for another day
I can't fake, I can't pretend
I can't stand and watch you say
These things you don't understand

I can't wait till I get the chance
Looking down, staring in your face
Motherfuckers rip off my name
And pretend on your bullshit fame

I'll bring da shit
I'll throwdown
I'll make you bleed

I can't wait here comes the hate
Whatcha gonna do without your fame?
You don't bith the hands that feeds ya
You're going down, no money can save ya

I'll bring da shit
I'll throwdown
I'll make you bleed

Heart, fist, soul, mind
Heart, fist, soul, mind
Heart, fist, soul, mind
Heart, fist, soul, mind
