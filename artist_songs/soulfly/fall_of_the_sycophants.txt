I'm talking revolution
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking retribution
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking devastation
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking execution
Destroy this fucking Place

I'm talking confrontation
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking murdernation
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking desperation
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking desolation
Destroy this fucking Place

A thousand years of war and hate
Now you bow down in the city of the dead...

I'm talking terminate
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking full of hate
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking bloodbath
Destroy this fucking Place
I'm talking doomsday
Destroy this fucking Place

The rites of war brought down the walls
The fall of the sycophants...
