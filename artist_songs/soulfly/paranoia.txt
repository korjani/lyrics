Feels like paranoia...
Feels like a black void
Feels like a war, crash, kill, fate, cult, coming
Feels like a screaming
Feels like a searching
Feels like a cold war, cut, raw, kill coming

Feels like a bomb blast
Like massive attack
Feels like a cold war, kill, pain, no holding back
Feels like a doomsday
Feels like the end of days
Feels like war face, war hate, storm

Feels like damnation
Like devastation
Feels like a doom force
Bomb blast intervention
Feels like a prophecy
Feels like energy
Feels like a fuck all, end all

Can you feel it burning?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it dropping?
Can you feel it exploding?
Can you feel it bombing?
Can you feel it rising?
Can you feel it burning?
