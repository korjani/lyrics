We reach our hands towards the sky
And wait for the killing sign
So follow me through the desert night
As we prepare for the fight

No one knows what the future brings
It can all end tonight
So kneel down, pray to the sky
That we can make it through the night

Under the moon, this march of doom, it comes too soon
Under the sun, prophecy undone, the omen will come
Blood, fire, follow the fire in this funeral pyre
Killing time, slowly freezes what's left behind

Kingdom of hate, kingdom of pain
Kingdom of doom, kingdom of death
Kingdom of hate, kingdom of pain
Kingdom of doom, kingdom of death

They slaughter without mercy, killing frenzy starts
Stone cold bloody mercenaries to the death
Brimstone and fire falls from the sky
Doomsday comes crashing in the air tonight

Kingdom of hate, kingdom of pain
Kingdom of doom, kingdom of death
Kingdom of hate, kingdom of pain
Kingdom of doom, kingdom of death

Forever your soul will hold
What you could not control
Forever your soul will hold
What you could not control

Kingdom, kingdom, kingdom, kingdom
Kingdom, kingdom, kingdom

We reach our hands towards the sky
And wait for the killing sign
So follow me through the desert night
