I don't give a fuck
You don't give a fuck
They don't give a fuck
Get back in the front

I don't give a fuck
You don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
Get back to the front

No one to trust
Just blood in the dust
Things just getting worse
Worse, worse, and worse

You kill - no remorse
You die - for what cause
They kill - no remorse
They die - for what cause

Back to the...
Back to the...
Back to the frontlines
Back to the...
Back to the...
Back to the frontlines

I don't give a fuck
You don't give a fuck
They don't give a fuck
Get back in the front

I don't give a fuck
You don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
Get back to the front

At war, once more
Peace is another sign that falls
I didn't want to be in war
But it follows me once more

For what, I don't know
I don't understand
Can you tell me who has won?
When nothing remains...

Back to the...
Back to the...
Back to the frontlines
Back to the...
Back to the...
Back to the frontlines

Back da fuck up now
Shut da fuck up now
Back to da front now
Back to the frontlines
