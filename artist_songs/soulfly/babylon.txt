Lightning and thunder
Fear and wonder
Murder and murder
Chaos, disorder
Hate and pain
Will rise again
Nothing remains
Bring it on again...

On and on and on and on...
On and on and on and on...
Inna babylon

Hell on earth
Like a curse
War is hell
Time will tell
Apocalypse meets
The final disease
Death now creeps
The enemy within...

On and on and on and on...
On and on and on and on...
Inna babylon

United nations
Divided tensions
Body count rises
While leaders lie

Desolation
Separation
Sufferation
Confrontation

On and on and on and on...
On and on and on and on...
Inna babylon

Desolation...
Annihilation...
Decapitation...
Seperation...
Murder nation...
Sufferation...
Confrontation...
Retaliation...
Mutilation...
Devastation...
Confrontation...
Too much tension...

On and on and on and on...
On and on and on and on...
Inna babylon
