The youth in the war
They say, they kill no more
Fuck you and your wars
They say they fear no more
The youth in the war
They say they feel no more
Fuck you and your wars
They say they hear no more

Time of war, time to rot
Time of horror, time of sorrow
Time of killing, time of bleeding
Time to fight, time to die
For those about to... rot
For those about to... die
For those about to... rot
For those about to...

The youth in the war
They say, they see no more
Fuck you and your wars
They say they feel no more
The youth in the war
They say, they breath no more
Fuck you and your wars
They are no more

Time of war time to rot
Time of horror, time of sorrow
Time of killing, time of bleeding
Time to fight, time to die
For those about to... rot
For those about to... die
For those about to... rot
For those about to...

Fuck you and your wars
Motherless children
Fuck you and your wars
Fatherless sons
Fuck you and your wars
Enough is enough
Fuck you and your wars
Why don't Presidents die in war?

Time of war time to rot
Time of horror, time of sorrow
Time of killing, time of bleeding
Time to fight, time to die
For those about to... rot
For those about to... die
For those about to... rot
For those about to...
