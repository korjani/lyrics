Time has arrived, we see all the signs 
Revolution now is the time 
Revelation soon to arise 
Tribulation means it's the time 
Send out the soldiers, 
their shield is their souls 
Revolution coming unfold 
Revelation coming untold 
The prophet born to the world 

Life, I know our life goes way out beyond 
I leave you fire to carry on 
Salvation coming to those 
With the most high in their souls 

Here comes the prophet 
(time has arrived) 
The prophet 
(revolution/revelation) 
Here comes the prophet 
(time has arrived) 

Rise above and beyond the sky 
You know that we got to fight 
The struggle to survive 
Fuck you, this is my life 

Um, dois, tre^is, quatro 

The prophet - mais forte do que a morte (stronger than death) 
The prophet - stronger than it all 
The prophet (tribal)
