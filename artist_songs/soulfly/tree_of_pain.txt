My pain is as deep as my roots
The yearning, the Hurting
What am I to do?
Indeed I plant seeds for the path I wald
And my voice helps them grow like water
When I talk but i'm hurting y'all
You didn't die in vain, your thought
With me remains and your soul gives me
Strength to face another day
Without you

In this tree of pain
In this tree of pain
In this tree of pain
Till the day I see you again...

Again
Under this tree of pain
Where we carved our names
Forever to remain

This pain
No one can understand
You know we can't pretend
That everything's ok

Bleeding...Screaming

I touch your grave
I kiss your face
This pain is more than I can take
I punch your grave
I call your name
This pain is more than I can take

Again
I find myself again
Under the tree of pain
Where we carved our names

Why then
Leace without goodbye
Just tears in my eyes
And the love you left inside

Bleeding...Screaming

I touch your grave
I kiss your face
This pain is more than I can take
I punch your grave
I call you name
This pain is more than I can take

For D-Low

Everyday that I pray
Why'd thay take his life away?
This pain, it hurts me so bad
All the days that I never had
All I have, my god
Is this tree of pain
All I have, my god
Is this tree of pain
Carved my name, my god
In this tree of pain
Carved my name, my god
In this tree of pain
Dana...One minute's all I need
Dana...To heal the things that bleed
Dana...Why god why?
