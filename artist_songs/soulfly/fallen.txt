This is the end of the world as we know it
Weapons of mass destruction are coming
Brutality of man is forming
Your temples will be destroyed

You are the fallen
You are the chosen
Your are the calling
You are forsaken
Fallen imperium - fallen imperium

Subhuman conditions are exposed
Sub-standard existence is lost
Hardening, a warrior is born
Seven pillars of wisdom

You are fallen heroes
You fallen angels
You are fallen traitors
You fallen kings
Fallen imperium - fallen imperium

I stare the abyss in its face
I'm burning you with my hate
Desolation they call this place
Witness hell... you maggot's race

Clean off the blood from my blade
Let it drop blood from my face

The new war ended but the threat remains
Our enemy has learned to live with pain
Confronting mutants going insane
Treacherous thoughts in your brain

Your fallen cities
Your fallen skies
Your fallen statues
You fall and rise
Fallen imperium - fallen imperium
