Lost in a ritual rage
I lost my normal behavior
Muthafucka - show your face
Hide on your invisible cage
Behind your fake name
Why don't you say that shit
To my face...

Arise again - arise again
People like you just fuel my hate
Arise again - arise again

At war with you again
I don't think you understand
Muthafucka, I don't pretend
Fuck you and your friends
Fuck you and your dreams
Can't you see we are not the same?

Arise again - arise again
People like you just fuel my hate
Arise again - arise again...
