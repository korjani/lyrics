Speak up - you know what is up 
Code of silence?! Who set you up?! 
Some shit so wrong in this world 
It's all fucked up now you're gone 
Speak up - you know what went on 
How could you let it go? 
It's murder you covered up 
Stained blood on your soul 

Down on my knees 
Hands stretched to heaven above 
Christ this pain is hard to live with 
Don't fill my heart with love 
Engulf my heart with vengeance 
You need to see our pain 
Don't fill this heart with love 
The truth needs to be told 

You can't mask 
Pain 
My pain 
Our Pain 
You can't mask 
Pain 
My pain 
Our pain 

"Fuck you... 
Friday I was freaking out"
