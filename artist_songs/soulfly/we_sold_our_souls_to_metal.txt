Born to rage against the order 
fuck the world we live forever
We wage war against you all 
I don't need society
I don't need your politricks
We live our lives the way we want

We sold our souls to metal
We sold our souls
We sold our souls to metal
We sold our souls

Fuck you all we don't belong
I want to burn your fucking world destroy 'em
All fuck your laws
Metal flows through my veins 
I wanna rage I am insane 
C'mon punk make my day

We sold our souls to metal
We sold our souls
We sold our souls to metal
We sold our souls

We sold our souls to metal
We sold our souls...
