Pressure building on my soul 
I ask God to take control 
Guide me through this fucked up world 

Conquer this fear spiritually 
Forever let it be 
Into infinity 

Against all odds we carry on 
Like we always did before 
Soulmate forever more 

I feel your presence every day 
It's so real in every way 
Give God thanks and praise! 

Just let my soul fly free 
And let me be the one God wants me to be 
Just let my soul fly free 
And let me see everything I'm 
supposed to see 

Just let my soul fly 
Just let my soul fly 
Just let my soul fly free!!! 

Pressure building on my soul 
I ask God to take control 
Give me guidance in this world 

Conquer this fear spiritually 
Forever let it be 
Into infinity
