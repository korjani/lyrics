You race towards an early grave
Your head explodes in a trance
The clouds bursts, thunder in your face
You raise the blade, it's time to pay

Justice
Vengeance
Freedom
Murder
Poison
Hatred
Wisdom
Terror

This is violence - this is hate
This is violence - this is pain
This is violence - this is death
This is violence - this is hell

We found a thousand ways to burn up the planet
Onwards to peace with hate in our minds
Like fucking cancer, screaming inside
Welcome to hell, consuming fire

Helter
Skelter
Seeking
Shelter
Karma
Burning
Manifest
Destiny

This is violence - this is hate
This is violence - this is pain
This is violence - this is death
This is violence - this is hell!

We all raise to rot and die
Purification is just a lie
Corruption burns the sky
For salvation you must fight

Immaculate conception
The wars we wage upon ourselves
The poison seeps into every pore
Kill your idols, kill your law
