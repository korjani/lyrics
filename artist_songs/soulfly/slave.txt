Master
Master
And who made him my master…
Involuntary
Servitude
Punishment comes for you…

From the cradle to the grave
Slave - slave
Remove the chains - emancipate
Slave - slave

Injustice
Oppression
For whom there is no protection
Retribution
Insurrection
The middle passage in action

From the cradle to the grave
Slave - slave
Remove the chains - emancipate
Slave - slave

I will
Arise
And Slay my enemies tonight
Whippings
Mutilations
And limb amputations

Grind, captive, confined…

Deep within
Has Been
The anguish of my soul
Face down
To the Earth
Through the skin you'll see my bones

Grind, captive, confined…

Zumbi E O senhor das querras
Zumbi E O senhor das demandas
Quando zumbi chega
E zumbi E quem manda…
