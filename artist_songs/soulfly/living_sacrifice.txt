Feel your soul and let it travel all across the world
It's the journey not the destination as we know

It's the living
It's the living
It's the living sacrifice

Sometimes it feels like we can't take no more
Have to find the strength, let the spirit overcome

It's the living
It's the living
It's the living sacrifice

Frustration
Redemption
Salvation
Motivation
Inspiration
No Temptation
Redemption
Salvation

Feel your soul and let it travel all across this world
It's the journey not the destination as we know
Sometimes it feels like we can't breathe no more
Have to find the hope, let the spirit overcome

Learn as if you're going to live forever
Live as if you're going to die tomorrow
