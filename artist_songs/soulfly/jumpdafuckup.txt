Jumpdafuckup! 

Muthafucka u don't understand 
All my hate! 
Muthafucka u don't understand 
All my rage! 
Muthafucka u don't understand 
All my pain! 
Muthafucka u don't understand... 

You seem to sever all my frequencies 
I'm tethered to your energies 
And everything turns inside out 
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud 

Maybe you would like to peek through the curtain 
At the same mistake you know you always make 
But...all I really want to know is 
Are you gonna lay the fuck back down 
Or jump da fuck up? 

Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
I'm full of hate, don't fuck with me 
Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
Open up your eyes and fucking see 
We got the tribe against society 
We got to fight the real enemy 
Get da fuck up, stand da fuck up 
Back da fuck up 

All this is making things a bit insane 
And I don't care who stares or stays 
The only thing that matters is 
Will you reach out if you can't resist? 

Maybe you don't give a shit for the rest of us 
But if you do, the time is now, if it ever was 
If you're gonna fight, whatcha gonna do? 
Jump da fuck up! 

How dare you single out my honesty 
Compare me to your travesties 
I only want to see you fight 
The darkness you wanna live your life by 

And if you're gonna quit 
I don't give a shit 
What the fuck, I'm a Mack truck 
Are you gonna give up like a bitch 
Or jump da fuck up? 

Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
I'm full of hate, don't fuck with me 
Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
Open up your eyes and fucking see 
We got the tribe against society 
We got to fight the real enemy 
Get da fuck up, stand da fuck up 
Muthafuckaaaaaaaarrggghhhh 

I'm a self-destructive piece of shit 
Smear me in 
I don't owe you a goddamn thing 
This life has never had the swing 
I don't wanna be immortal or legend or anything 
Cuz the longer I'm alive, the better off you'll be 
Get ready for epitome, come on and pity me... 
Will you kill me if I say please? 

I'm the same old reasons not to try 
What the hell 
Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell 
Come and get me, mom would never let me do it 
I'm ruined, I don't want anything from you 
Cuz I've got nothing left to prove, c'mon 
My time, everything feels fine, goodbye 
Killing from the inside
