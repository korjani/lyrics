Fire, the burning path
Downstroy the weak minds
The weak minds rising nature’s demise
Enslave system creation

[Chorus:]
Everywhere is bloodshed
Wasteland bloodshed
Everywhere is bloodshed
Wasteland bloodshed
Bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed

Life, ravage skullduggery
Rage, dethrone the enemy
Die treacherous leprosy
Scorn the self inflict

[Chorus:]
Everywhere is bloodshed
Wasteland bloodshed
Everywhere is bloodshed
Wasteland bloodshed
Bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed

This is my redemption
Strangling superstitions
This is my conception
Condemned for eternity

Blood of the lamb touching the empty void
Slowly eats my soul
Drag down the black hole
Join the cult of dark hope
Swarm of deadly locusts
Beware of the prophecy
Rulers of reality
