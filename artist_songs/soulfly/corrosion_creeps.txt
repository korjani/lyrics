Keep an eye in the sky
Night after night
Sign after sign
Don't fall behind
Land of the sun
Empires will burn
Can't trust no one
No return...

Live on the edge
No man's land
Blood on the sand
End of all things
Killing edge
Khyber pass
City of God
Dreader than dread

This corrosion creeps
And it's crawling too deep
This corrosion creeps
And it's making you sick

Life after life
Ragin inside
Sign after sign
Thorn on your side
Curse undone
Burn as one
Trust no soul
You're on your own

This corrosion creeps
And it's crawling too deep
This corrosion creeps
And it's making you sick

This corrosion
This corrosion...

Emptiness, fearless
It's not for you to understand
Self-destruct, don't give a fuck
Cut-throat, you can't tame my soul
Suicidal, schizophrenic
Killing like a feeding frenzy
Wicked, brutal
Cut you down like a thousand swords

This corrosion creeps
And it's crawling too deep
This corrosion creeps
And it's making you sick

This corrosion
This corrosion
This corrosion
This corrosion...

Keep an eye in the sky
The sky is falling tonight
It's not so far
Babylon is not far

A thousand feet high
At the mercy of the skies
As the souls dive
The new millenium is crucified
