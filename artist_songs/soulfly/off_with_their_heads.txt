Off with their heads all across the land
Off with their heads, ritual will prepare
Off with their heads, crossbones and skulls dead
Off with their heads, kill all them inbreds

Off with their heads, beware of what's ahead
Off with their heads, betray and now they're dead
Off with their heads just like the old ones had
Off with their heads, hate without end

Off with their heads in this no man's land
Off with their heads, their fate is now in hand
Off with their heads, to kill is their intent
Off with their heads, in blood this will end

Off with their heads, sacrifice 'til death
Off with their heads, now they learn to obey
Off with their heads in between life and death
Off with their heads, you're born with a price on your head

Skulls, bones, Rome burns
Doom falls, war comes
Die, lie, sick soul
Scream, sin in between

Skulls, bones, Rome burns
Doom falls, war comes
Die, lie, sick soul
Scream, sin in between

Off with their heads all across the land
Off with their heads, ritual will prepare
Off with their heads, crossbones and skulls dead
