The execution of the world is set
The revolution you can't take it back
This frustration equals inspiration
The execution of your world is set

Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire

The execution of the world is set
To fight back all you hypocrites
This frustration is my inspiration
The execution of your life is set

Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim Fire

The execution of the world is set
Downstroy your envy with my bloody hands
This frustration is my inspiration
The execution of your world is set
