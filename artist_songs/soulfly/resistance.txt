Brethren, arise, arise
Strike for your lives and liberties
Now is the day and the hour
Let every slave throughout the land do this
And the days of slavery are numbered
You cannot suffer greater cruelties than you have already
Rather die free men then live to be slaves
Let your motto be:
Resistance...
Resistance...
Resistance...
