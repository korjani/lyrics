Carved inside - carved outside
Scream at the sky - forever fight
My peace of mind - I got to find
True peace of mind - so hard to find

Now...
I feel your soul inside
Now...
Carved inside

They try to bring us down
We're growing all around
Inside you must be free
To find your destiny
Lose yourself
Find yourself
Nothing to prove
To nobody else

Now...
Feel your soul inside
Now...
Carved inside

My life is mine
My right is mine
Your eyes petrified
Fire from inside...

Carved inside - carved outside
Feel your soul glow - in the sky...
Let your soul now - move the world now
Feel your soul now - let your soulfly...

You must change from
Inside out
You fall, we rise
Inside out
