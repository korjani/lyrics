Mater
Thunder and lightning
Halo of Light
Mother of Dragons
Draco - Warrior
They call me - Spitfire

A phoenix from the ash, this is my destiny
My reign is forever, no way you can kill me
A battle I will wage, the dawn of this new age
My time has arrived, now feel my rage...

Black wings unfurl the life to my bones
Dying in smoke, I'm born in the coals
Scales hard as iron, you'll never pierce my hull
Run you fucking cowards, pissing as you're burned

Rise my dragons - Rise above it all
Rise my dragons - Rise till dawn
Rise my dragons - Into the unknown
Rise my dragons - Take your throne

Mater Draco
