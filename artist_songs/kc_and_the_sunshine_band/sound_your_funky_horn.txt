Bass man turn the power on
Drummer turn the beat
Tenor man come take your stand
Everybody on your feet

Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down
Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down

Guitar keep the rhythm
Congas and the groove
When my main man gets on his horn
Everybody's got to move

Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down
Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down, ooh

Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down (Get down)
Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down

Bass man, Mr. Drummer
Keep a smile on your face
And get down Mr. Conga
Keep on keepin' a steady pace

Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down
Everybody sound your funky horn
Come on get down, ooh…hoo…

Everybody come on
Sound your funky (Ooh), let it blow (Let it blow)
Let me hear it (Let me hear it), let me hear it (Let me hear it)
Let me hear it (Let me hear it), let me hear it (Let me hear it)
Let me hear it (Let me hear it)
