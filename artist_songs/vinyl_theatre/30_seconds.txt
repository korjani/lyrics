There's a feeling I get
Takes me back to Graceland
There's a courage I get
Stolen wisdom from my old man

Won't break a sweat because I'm losing my emotion
I won't break a sweat because I'm losing my emotion

There's a fear in my head
It'll all be forgotten
And what's the point of a memory
Now if I'm only gonna lose it

I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime
I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime

There's a hole in my head
Where there used to be an old friend
And my temper's rising
I can't remember what you once said

Won't break a sweat because I'm losing my emotion
I won't break a sweat because I'm losing my emotion

There's a fear in my head
It'll all be forgotten
And what's the point of a memory
Now if I'm only gonna lose it

I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime
I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime

No
I can't make me remember
No
It's just a matter of time
No
They can't make me remember
No
It's just a matter of time

There's a fear in my head
It'll all be forgotten
And what's the point of a memory
Now if I'm only gonna lose it

I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime
I don't mind
30 seconds or a lifetime
