I've got these drums in my head
And these feelings won't subside
I've got these drums in my mind
They shake me from inside

We could reminisce
There are things I miss
About the quiet
But keeping with the drums
Will take you to
Your wild desires

Oh Oh Oh Oh,
We could drum and sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh,
We could drum oh sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum and sing along
and take you to the place that you want

I've got these drums in my head
But I'm falling out of time
Dust on the words that you said
But they shake me from inside

We could reminisce,
There are things I miss
About the quiet.
But keeping with the drums
Will take you to,
Your wild desires.

Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum and sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum oh sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum and sing along
and take you to the place that you want.

I can't speak, I can't sleep, I'm here alone
I can't speak, I can't sleep, I'm here alone

Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum and sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum oh sing along
Oh Oh Oh Oh
We could drum and sing along
and take you to the place that you want
