You're like a rebel on a wire
You gotta fight them till you're bleeding
You're like a voice through the sirens
They're gonna miss you when you leave them

And I thought he was a loner, stoner
Nothing's gonna bring him back
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO
Everybody come together forever
Not much, it's just a heart attack
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO

You're gonna hit him with your best shot
You're hardly ever gonna miss him
You said you wanna start a fight
I'm gonna miss you when it's all done

And I thought he was a loner, stoner
Nothing's gonna bring him back
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO
Everybody come together forever
Not much, it's just a heart attack
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO

Never gonna give it away
Whatever they say, whatever they say, no
I'm never gonna give it away
I'm keeping it safe, I'm keeping it safe for you

And I thought he was a loner, stoner, a loner
And I thought he was a loner, stoner, a loner
Everybody come together forever
Not much, it's just a heart attack
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO

And I thought he was a loner, stoner
Nothing's gonna bring him back
And everyone says it's the RADIO, RADIO
