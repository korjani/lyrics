Wait, I meant to keep you
But I had to live out the dream.
Wait, I meant to hide you
Safe away from the scene.

You, you had me thinking,
These times I wish they would last
You, you had me guessing,
Guessing all along.

I know we're kidding this time,
I think I got it by now.
Come be my role model now,
I need a taste for a while then I'll let you go.
Is there a place you would rather be?
Show me your true face then hide from me

But I always end up kissing you then miss you even more and more.
I always mess it up, I never got it right not even once.
You tell me I'm a liar that I can't decide which way to go.
But in the end you're like me.
And in the end you're like me.

Wait, I keep the lights on
Just in case someone calls.
You, I need to have you
By my side tonight.

I know we're kidding this time,
I think I got it by now.
Come be my role model now,
I need a taste for a while then I'll let you go.
Is there a place you would rather be?
Show me your true face then hide from me.

But I always end up kissing you then miss you even more and more.
I always mess it up, I never got it right not even once.
You tell me I'm a liar that I can't decide which way to go.
But in the end, you're like me.
And in the end you're like me.

But in the end you're like me
And in the end you're like me.
But in the end, and in the end,
And in the end, end, end you're like me.

Make way for the gold rush, gold rush, gold rush.
Make way for the gold rush.
Make way for the gold rush, gold rush, gold rush.
Make way for the gold rush.
Get out.
