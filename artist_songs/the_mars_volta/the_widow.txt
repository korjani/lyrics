He's got fasting black lungs 
Made of clove splintered shardes 
They're the kind that will talk 
Through a weezing of coughs 

And I hear him every night 
In every pore 
And every time he just makes me warm 

Freeze without an answer 
Free from all the shame 
Must I hide?
Cause I'll never 
Never sleep alone 

Look at how they flock to him 
From an isle of open sores 
He knows that the taste is such 
Such to die for 

And I hear him every night 
On every street 
The scales that do slither 
Deliver me from... 

Freeze without an answer 
Free from all the shame 
Then I'll hide 
Cause I'll never 
Never sleep alone 

Oh lord 
Said I'm bloodshot for sure 
Pale runs the ghost 
Swollen on the shore 

Everynight 
in every pore 
The scales that do slither 
Deliver me from... 

Freeze without an answer 
Free from all the shame 
Then I'll hide 
Cause I'll never 
Never sleep alone 

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Let me die
Cause I'll never 
Never sleep alone
