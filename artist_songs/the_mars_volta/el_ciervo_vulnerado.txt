I've been drinking black mirror again 
The closer we part 
I needed to touch your lips 
With the nail in my heart 
The night that you caught me 
My coffin did walk 
I fell at your mercy 
I fell in your grave 
Meccamputechture 
That stands in my way 
The younger I stay 
An elderly child 
The longer the mirror gives birth 
To the death I file 

If you consume me I will not let you go 
If you walk right through me 
My voice will taint your throat 
Blessed be the wrong I've done 

Someone is watching us 
Someone has found 
Fluorescent ligaments 
On a black white tile 
Why do you call them 
If your kingdom won't come 
The younger I stay 
Forever I rot 

If you consume me I will not let you go 
If you walk right through me 
My voice will taint your throat 
Blessed be the wrong I've done 

Because the flies my mouth spill 
Bare the children at play
