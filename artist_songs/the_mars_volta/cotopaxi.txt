When sanskrit was my mother tongue
Scarabs filled my pillow
Tarmac strips to pave for them
And thrones from which to teach
And in that pulse the future said
The story had been spun
You wet your bed so sleep in it
Cards can't make a house

And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole...

When light years came
And light years passed
Tugging on the brink
Spoils reported missing
Put down in its sleep
Strangled in the background
Fitted for a mask
The future won't believe you
Past the ransom fast

And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole...

Don't beat around the pulpit
There is no lost and found
Where is the devil waiting
Trying to disguise...
I've seen what you used to look like
But down here you won't survive

I've got the weight of half of the world
Don't stop dragging the lake
I won't come home
If you can't come home
Even if you make a grave with my name
You better keep on looking for me
