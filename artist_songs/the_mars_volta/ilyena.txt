When the chants have cycled
How can I go wrong?
There will be no Eve for Adam
If your apples have gone, gone, gone, gone
I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Cypher is filled
With a blanket of clots
Taking everything I've got
Please let me in, in, in, in
I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion
Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins
I seem to hide in metal plates
Held together alone don't wait
Hide with me identity
Until we've passed due date

Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
