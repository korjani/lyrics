Here it comes again
Mesh of arms travels up my neck

Morning dawn declares itself
And mirrors stare back at my reflection

When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I want winter to fall on me

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
I am free of equity

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that I’m under

A kindred connivance
I’m ripped and in ruins

Here it comes again
Malady of Veda in your ears

Flood the droughts that those...
I can’t stop myself because

When I'm alone, I’m alone at night
I will set my father free

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over

A kindred connivance
I’m ripped and in ruins

Long way patience to drown
With friends that you won’t save for me

Long way patience to drown
Spin through my spiral, I danced with delay

Long way patience to drown
You call me, I answer and all I can do is obey

Long way patience to drown
I can’t hold my breath for this long

When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I wanna set my father free

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over

I won’t let you, I won’t let them
Set me to repeat
