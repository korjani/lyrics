If I trust in the wind she will pave me a different road
I will try and start over but I think I must choose someone else
I am pulled from the pages where the letters lack the pigment of trust

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

I’ve abandoned the outcome in search of the rest I deserve
You can do what you will with my body but I won’t ring the bell
I’ve omitted the chapters that bow and admit defeat

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Of the flowers that grew from the cracks in the ground you paved
Didn’t you think he would warn me through the thorns of my waking dreams
When the riddles connected the dots of this constellation

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains 
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

I found a reason to leave you with this love
All I can do is forgive your broken heart
Trapped in this town made of amber for too long
All I can do is forgive your broken heart 

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog
