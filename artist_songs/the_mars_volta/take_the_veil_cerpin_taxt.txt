You must have been phlegmatic in stature 
The gates of thanos are a spread eagle wide 
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes 
Out of a blind mans picaresque heart 

You take the veil 
You'll take the dive 
You take the veil 

It's not over till the tremulant sings 
These ides of march 
Are they so make believe 
How tempts the revenant 
Slice up and not across 

You take the veil 
You'll take the dive 
You take the veil 

A mass of gallon sloth 
As flys have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim-someone said but who is to know 
And when you find the fringe 
The one last hit that spent you 
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day 

The iconoclastic had it coming for years 
They know the prisons that you have yet to fear 
Where thumbs hide inside of sleepingbag mouths 
Adlib your memoires by casting a drought 

You take the veil 
You'll take the dive 
You take the veil 

A mass of gallon sloth 
As flys have walls for feet 
A rapturous verbatim-someone said but who is to know 
And when you find the fringe 
The one last hit that spent you 
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day 

Knife me in -hobbeling 
Talking in it's sleep again 
Knife me in-hobbeling 
Talking in it's sleep again 

Knife me in hobbling 
Talking in it's sleep again 
Knife me in hobbling 
Talking in It's sleep again 

Virulent hives- of bedpost piles 
Virulent hives 

Who brought me here 
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear 
Who turned it off 
The last thing I remember now 
Who brought me here 
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear 
Who turned it off 
The last thing I remember now 
Who brought me here
