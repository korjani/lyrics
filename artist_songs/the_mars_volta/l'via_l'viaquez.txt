L' Via 
Hija de Miranda 
Tu Apellido se cambio 
L' Via 
Sin Ojos me quieres dar 
Una historia sin mi madre 
Solo tengo que decirte 
El dolor de noche dice 
Solo se quedo el vestido 
Le lave la sangre 

L' Via 
No dejes de descansar 
En la calle caminas 
Quien te va a perseguir 
L' Via 
Te quieren matar 
Dientes de Machete 
Cabezas de gallo 

L' Via 
Durmiendo en paz 
Abre los ojos 
Todo cambiara 
L' Via 
Sonado de venganza 
Y yo te lo juro 
Lo van a pagar 
Blackmailed, she fell off every mountain 
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape 
In her eraser sang the guilty 
As it made the best mistakes 
And with every body that I find 
And with every claymore that they mine 
I won't forget who I'm looking for 
Oh mother help me I'm looking for

Solo tengo 
Una hora 
Y me duermo 
Terminado 
Por veinte y cinco 
Anos pasaron 
Siguen los cuerpos 
Aqui temblando 
Tome la sangre 
Comi el cuerpo 
Mis lagrimas 
Quiebra el espejo 

When all the worms come 
Crawlin out of your head 
Telling you 
Don't you be afraid 
When all the worms come 
Crawlin out of your head 
Telling you 
Don't you be afraid 

Blackmailed she fell off every mountain 
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape 
In her eraser sang the guilty 
As it made the best mistakes 
Shark kites got tangled in the moleskin 
Urgent plea of escape 
A mouth to mouth on the chalkboard 
Written in fingernail distaste 
And with every body that I find 
And with every claymore that they mine 
I won't forget who I'm looking for 
Oh mother help me I'm looking for
