You've got the lot to burn 
A shelve of pig smotherd cries 
Is there a spirit that spits 
Upon the exit of signs 
Is anybody there 
(spines in a row)
These steps keep on growing long 
(spite as an arrow)
Bayonet trials rust propellers await 
No 
Nobody is heard 
Rowing sheep smiles for the dead 
Nobody is heard 
An antiquated home 
Afloat with engines on mute 
Sui generis ship spined around the yard 
Is anybody there 
(spines in a row)
These craft only multiply 
(spine as an arrow)
At the nape of ruins rust propellers await
No 
Nobody is heard compass wilting in the wind 
Nobody is heard 
Rowing sheep smile for the dead 
Transoceanic depth in this earth 
In this cenotaph 
Lash of one thousand eye brows clicking 
Counting the toll 
Counting the toll

Nobody is heard rowing sheep smile for the dead 
Transoceanic depth in this earth in this cenotaph 
Carpel jets 
hit the ground 
Carpel jets 
hit the ground 
Carpel jets 
hit the ground 
Carpel jets 
hit the ground 
Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking 
Counting the toll
