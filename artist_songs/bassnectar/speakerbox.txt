When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son
When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son

We about to go...

Laid back hot in the cut like that

In a millisecond have it going up like that
