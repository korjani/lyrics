Voodoo symphony [x8]

Voodoo symphony 
In the M-I-N-D
Wav files rub on your brain files constantly

Open frequency.
Coming way louder than a wire that sweapt the beat.
Bomb threat on the deck right where you are apt to be.
Jumpin off hard in the front and the back of me.
Mash it up properly. [x2]

Mash it up properly.

Mas-mash it up properly.

Let me see how you humpty dance.
We should get together while we got the chance, to. 
Yep, yeah, you know how we do 
Old school, new school, then combine the two.

And damn, it seems you're doin it justice.
I love the way you move it when we show up and bust this.
Trust it, gets better ya'll, cocktail Molotov.
Sweat it off, digital to analog.

I think that's it.
That's it.

Mash it up properly.

Mas-mash it up properly.
