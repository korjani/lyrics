Spin your body around
Now your feet are gonna hit the ground
I am going sleepless and you're out of lullabies

Honey, honey, honey you're the death of me
Won't stop holding my hands down
Baby, baby, baby you'll never let me

You've got a dark heart
You've got a cold kiss

You want my love, my love, my love
(You want my love)

Everybody's breakin' and everytime you start shakin'
Don't come calling my name

Everybody's fallin' every time you come-a-calling
I want you to know

Honey, honey you are the first one
Darling, darling around my door

Honey, honey you'll never let me

You've got a dark heart
You've got a cold kiss

You've got a dark heart
You've got a cold kiss

You want my love, my love, my love
(You want my love)

Always turning back to you
'til you never let me down
Loving your illusions
Staring at a crooked crown

You always let me down [x3]

You want my love, my love, my love
(You want my love)

Honey, honey, honey you're the death of me
Honey, honey, honey will you ever see?
