You were a child who was made of glass
You carried a black heart passed down from your dad
If somebody loved you, they'd tell you by now
We all turn away when you're down

You want to go back to where you felt safe
To hear your brother's laughter,
See your mother's face
Your childhood home is just powder-white bones
And you'll never find your way back

And when you're gone, will they say your name?
And when you're gone, will they love you the same?
If not, that's okay.
If not, that's okay.

You are broken and callow
Cautious and safe
You are boundless and beauty
With fright in your face
Until someone loves you,
I'll keep you safe
But like them, I will give you away

And when you're gone, will they say your name?
And when you're gone, will they love you the same?
If not, that's okay.

And when you're gone, will they say your name?
And when you're gone, will they love you the same?
Oh, when you're gone, we won't say a word
But you know that's okay.
Don't you know that's okay?
