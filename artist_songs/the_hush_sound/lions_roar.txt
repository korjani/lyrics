The lions roar and young men soar
The flames all scorch the circus floor
Puppets on string all dance and sing and flap their wings
Trumpets play sick lullabies

Delicate dame her fragile face
Was scared away without a trace
Out in the cold, where did she go?
Into unknown a place I'll never

Know and the desperate search began
All across this sea and land
I just knew I'd find you here
I just knew I'd find you

Elephants rear and young men steer
The audience just claps and cheers
I asked around half empty towns
About a girl nowhere to be found

And the desperate search began
All across this sea and land
I just knew I'd find you here
I just knew I'd find you

We didn't know, we could not go
The circus songs just carried on
Out of the crowd three men rush out
And scream and shout, "Everybody Stop!"
