You are the lighthouse, the seamark 
The tempests created this tide 
I'm pulled to the black silver ocean 
where the current and the heavens collide 

You are the brick 
I am so unpredictable 
led by the current away 
Your solid stage is so necessary to save 
all those who stray 

You are the navigator who never could lead 
we were lost in the silver sea 
I was the ship who was too proud to ever sink. 

I am your thought but the water is amnesia 
my name is on the tip of your tongue 
My image is slipping 
but your memory is gripping it 
this is my breath in your lungs 

You are the navigator who never could lead 
we were lost in the silver sea 
I was the ship who was too proud to ever sink. 

Echo, my voice is an echo 
of places I don't know 
and stories I've been told 

Echo. We all are connected 
a lighthouse a voyage 
for history's sake, 
will you please take notice?
