All your friends are famous, you're the man at pulling favours
Is that the best that you could do? Is that the best we can do?
You say it before, and say it again
"You're gonna be massive it's a matter of when"
Is that the best we could do? Do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around, you're getting me down

It's not that you're used to failure, you put the hours in the cheques come later
That's the best that you can do? It's time to take on something new?
You're moving in circles, you're all over LA
You're big with the ladies, so they don't think you're gay
Is that the best you could do? And do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around, you're getting me down
You're getting around, you're getting me down

And when it don't work out, you put them on the stand
Its not you're fault you got them eating from your hand
You say the words, and everybody leaves (I'm not "your boy" and that's not the point)
You change your hair, you fully rock a weave
You don't make sense and you don't want to know
You're self defensive, oh-uh

You're getting me down, you're getting around
You're getting me down, you're getting around
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around, you're getting me down [x28]
