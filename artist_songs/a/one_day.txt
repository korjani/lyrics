One day, you'll be on your own
You won't have a shout any more
One day, you'll be in the ground
You're over and out, and
You've missed the last tube home
[x2]

Woke up this morning, heard someone snoring
Knobheads going on about modern life is boring
Bears have their own music, no-one can prove it
Just like I'm a guy of guys
You think I'm gonna move it

One day, you'll be on your own
You won't have a shout any more
One day, you'll be in the ground
You're over and out, and
You've missed the last tube home

Sum up together, nobody's the wiser
It's life in the sunshine, that's what I would advise her
[?]

One day, you'll be on your own
You won't have a shout any more
One day, you'll be in the ground
You're over and out, and
You've missed the last tube home
[x2]

One day, you'll be on your own
You won't have a shout any more
One day, you'll be in the ground
You're over and out, and
You've missed the last tube home
