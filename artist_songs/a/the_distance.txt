We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! 

Running out of luck
Trying to keep it punk
You can only let yourself down
Afraid of what you know
A square shape in a round hole
You know, it goes in tight,
Goes in tight

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?

You're running out of time
You're never going nowhere
The best is all behind you
You're spending your cash like a man with no hands
Keepin' it real like your favourite bands
If they don't try
Then we don't buy, we don't buy

It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up

[SOLO!]

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!

It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up

It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
Yeah, come on!

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!

So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up

Stand up
