Lose yourself, save yourself. 
One more night, one more time. 
By yourself, no one else. 
One arrival time to hear you cry tonight. 

Pray today, slide away. 
And hide away, no one came. 
Holy graves, maiden names. 
Take a breath and hold it in and out again. 

And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 

Take yourself, you hate yourself. 
Lie awake, wide awake. 
Bruise yourself, lose yourself. 
Pressure's on but not for long remind yourself. 

And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 

Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 

And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life.
