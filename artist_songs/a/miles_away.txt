Your Miles Away

I'm Not messing about, got a mile of self doubt
Yeah, you're not even close, yeah
Because you're miles away

Another day in bed, sorting out your head
You don't know what you're talking about

You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong

You're miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over

Yeah, the robot voice, and the peoples choice
Yeah you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away

You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about

You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong

You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over

I'm too skint to pay my debtors, uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under, how did you get my number?
Oh-oh it's for the better, than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back and back and back, around we go

You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over

Miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over [x4]
