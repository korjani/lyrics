She's got her decks and her vodkas
And every man is a faggot
She said

She's got a new [?] wells book
She wrote his name on the [?]
Instead

Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday
What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
Walking through your life

I'm pretty caned in Ibiza
None of her friends would believe her
She said

She can't wait for the Notting Hill
And he's already had a belly full
Instead

Monday, Tuesday, it's the same
Wednesday, Thursday, act your age
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
Walking through your life

You're nearly forty now, have you forgotten how?
You go with whatever's easy, there's nothing left to believe in
It's just a word that you heard on the radio
You're not a mod or a rocker
You've never heard of Nirvana

You're nearly forty now, have you forgotten how?
Like when we used to walk the beach

Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

Monday, Tuesday, it's the same
Wednesday, Thursday, act your age
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
