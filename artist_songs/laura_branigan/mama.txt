Mama
Remember how you warned me 
That he would only hurt me? 
Remember how I didn't listen then, wasn't listening? 
Mama
You said I shouldn't see him
Said I didn't need him 
Said "A boy like that is gonna take your heart
Just to break your heart" 
Told me from the start
He would break my heart 
And I guess I was a bad girl 
But you just never understood 
How the lovin' of that bad boy
Made your bad girl feel so good 

I'd sneak out my window
We'd meet in the night deep in the darkness 
He knew how to love me so right 
Mama, ooh, he was a wild one 
And, ooh, I was a child once 
But I will never be a child again
After lovin' him 
Oh, not after lovin' him

Mama
I never knew a boy's touch 
Could ever teach me so much 
All those nights you didn't understand
I was in good hands 
Mama
If I would have listened
The kissin' I'd be missin'! 
I tell you
You were wrong as you could be
He's still here with me 

Sneakin' out my window
We meet in the night deep in the darkness 
He knows how to love me so right 
Mama
Ooh, that boy's touch
Need it so much 
Mama
Ooh, that wild one
Need to feel him 
Mama
Ooh, that bad boy
He gives me such joy 
Mama
I'm such a bad girl
He gives me such joy 
Mama
