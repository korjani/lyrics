You don't act the same 
And your eyes have changed 
I don't want to hear the words you say
I don't want to know the pain 

And I see your lips move 
But I can't hear the sound
So I turn my head away
As my heart drops to the ground

And I've tried to see right through you 
But it's all in vain 
Like a locomotive blinded by the rain
And I swear that you loved me just the other day
I still remember how you used to say

I would die for you
I would live for you
I would fight for the right just to give to you
You can set me free but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win
Didn't we almost win it all 

Time seems to heal wounds
Well that's what they say
But it doesn't matter now
'Cause I never felt that way

And I see your lips move 
But I can't hear the sound 
So I turn my head away
As my heart drops to the ground

And I've tried to see right through you
But it's all in vain 
Like a locomotive blinded by the rain
And I swear that you loved me just the other day 
I still remember how you used to say

I would die for you
I would live for you 
I would fight for the right just to give to you
You can set me free but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win
Didn't we almost win it all 

I could swear that you loved me just the other day
I still remember how you used to say

I would die for you
I would live for you
I would fight for the right just to give to you 
You can set me free but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win
Didn't we almost win it all 

You can set me free but you'll come back to me 
Didn't we almost win
Didn't we almost win
It all
