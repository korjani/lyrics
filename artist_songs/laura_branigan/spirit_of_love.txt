I can't tell you no one will ever die from a broken heart
But one thing I know since I've loved you
I know that I'm alive 
So why do you keep holding back 
Don't run away from what we have
I would never hurt you darling

Can't stop the rain when you hear the thunder 
Tonight's the night we're caught up in the flood
Don't you see we were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love

Naked alone what would I be if your love
Had never found me 
One thing that's real 
Is only the trust we give to one another
So touch me or I'll lose mind
We've waited for the longest time 
It's too late to stop now

Can't stop the rain when you hear the thunder 
Tonight's the night we're caught up in the flood
Don't you see we were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
