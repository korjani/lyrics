Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow
It's just a matter of time
Until you're running back in my arms again
Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow
I hear you knock on my door 
And it will be just like before you were gone
Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow
I won't be thinking of you 
And you will be wondering what to do all alone

One more night I won't miss you
One more day I'll be alright
A few more hours to watch the rain fall
I don't miss you at all

Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow
It's just a matter of time 
Until you're running back in my arms again

I can do what I want, don't need nobody to comfort me
I sleep okay at night, don't need your body right next to me

Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow
I hear you knock on my door 
And it will be just like before you were gone
Maybe tonight and then maybe tomorrow
I won't be thinking of you
And you will be wondering what to do all alone

I can do what I want, don't need nobody to comfort me
I sleep okay at night, don't need your body next to me 
Maybe tonight and maybe tomorrow 
It's just a matter of time 
Until you're running back in my arms again
