Here in the night
There's a perfume in the air
And you can almost smell the danger 
Pressed in a crowd
You can feel the heat flow 
In the touch of every stranger 
We're out on the town 
And it's action that we're after
Keep fannin' the flame just a little faster

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight 
It's gonna be a hot night 
We won't get no sleep tonight 
Too hot, it's too hot 

The need in your eyes
Hits me to the heart 
With a shot of stimulation 
Come on with me
In a moment I will see such a burnin' fascination

No stopping it now
We got to stay in motion 
We're two-footed fire two-footed emotion

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight 
It's gonna be a hot night 
We won't get no sleep tonight 
Too hot, it's too hot [repeat]

No stopping it now
We got to stay in motion 
We're two-footed fire two-footed emotion

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight 
It's gonna be a hot night 
We won't get no sleep tonight 
Too hot, it's too hot... [Fade out]
