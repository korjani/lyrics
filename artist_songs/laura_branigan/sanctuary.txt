Do you think you can find
In other arms the peace of mind
If you do you're so mistaken
'Cause they're only taking love
You'd think pain was back in style
The way you force yourself to smile
But I know your heart is breaking 
When it should be making love

If your love's been more like a revolving door 
And you're feeling tired and weary
You'll find the love that you've been searching for 

Here in the heart of my
Sanctuary
Sanctuary
Here in my heart

I feel your pain your despair 
Sometimes it's more than I can bear
Just to know your heart is breaking 
When it could be making love

If your love's been more like a revolving door 
And you're feeling tired and weary 
You'll find the love that you've been searching for 

Here in the heart of my
Sanctuary
Sanctuary
Here in my heart
Sanctuary
Sanctuary 
Here in my heart
