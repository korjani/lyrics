Maybe I'm a fool, one day we'll know 
Maybe I'm a fool, only time can show 
But now these lonely nights are killin' me
I'm so far away from reality 
The pain grows stronger 
I can't hold on much longer 
It hurts when I think of how I had your sweet love 
And still I set you free

Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand
Lucky, guess it's not like we planned 
Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go

I wish that you could see the tears on my face
Painful memories of a love I can't replace 
I'm sailin' in the past, and I'm sinkin' fast 
You can hear my S.O.S. cryin' out for tenderness
Though yesterday's dead and gone 
Your magic still lingers on 
It hurts when I think of how I had your sweet love 
And how I set you free 

Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, I guess it's not like we planned, oh no no 
Oh Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go 
Oh Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, I guess it's not like we planned 
Oh Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go 
Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand
