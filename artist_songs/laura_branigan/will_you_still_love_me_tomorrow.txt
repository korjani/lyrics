Tonight you're mine completely
You gave your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure?
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I, can I believe the magic of your sigh?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken, baby,
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell, tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me?
Will you still love me?
Will you still love me... tomorrow?
