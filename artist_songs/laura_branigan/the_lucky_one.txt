You can break away or you can stay 
You choose your life, you're free to fly 
Go on and fly 
Go on and fly 

She had it in her own time 
To get away and try to find 
Somewhere to go, to run 
She saw the world through open eyes 
And never let a soul inside 
Don't come too close, so close 
Baby thinks she's smart, but what about her heart? 

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night 
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice 
'cos the world's in your hands, you got all you want 
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 

Her soul was strong, her heart was tough 
And when she felt she had enough 
She tore herself away 
Love in the dark is all you see 
Get what you want, not what you need 
You look the other way 
Never letting on to what it's all become 

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night 
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice 
'cos the world's in your hands, and you've got all you want 
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 

Life is a dream, the lucky one, the lucky one, the lucky one 
Oh, life is a dream, the lucky one 
Life is a dream, the lucky one, the lucky one 
Baby thinks she's smart, but what about her heart? 

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night 
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice 
'cos the world's in your hands, and you've got all you want 
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one 
Oh, the lucky one
