As I look out of my window 
I see your face in each shadow on the street below me 
And as I hear the hard rain falling 
I wonder will you be calling, do you still wanna hold me? 
I think will you turn away? 
Do you wanna say it's over? 
Will you really come? 
Was it just for fun, I wonder 
Is it easy to see, that every time you touch me 

With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside 
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight 
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you 
I need you now, with every beat of my heart 

As I lay down in this dark room 
I hear your voice like a soft tune, echo all around me 
And as I feel the cold wind blowing 
I wonder will you be showing, or forget you ever found me? 
I think will you turn away? 
Do you wanna say it's over? 
Will you really come? 
Was it just for fun, I wonder 
Is it easy to see, that every time you touch me 

With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside 
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight 
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you 
I need you now, with every beat of my heart 
With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside 
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight 
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you 
I need you now, with every beat of my heart 
With every beat of my heart, with every beat of my heart 
Every beat of my heart, oh, every beat of my heart 
Every beat of my heart, deep inside of me something's died...
