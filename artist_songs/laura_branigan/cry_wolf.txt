You couldn't wait for answers 
You just had to try those wings
And all your happy ever afters 
Didn't mean a thing 
So I'm not gonna try at all 
To keep you from the flame 
Just remember not to call my name 

When you cry wolf 
Once too often
When you cry wolf 
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf 
I won't hear you anymore 

If you start to stumble
If you start to crack 
And if you're ever feeling humble 
Don't look back 

When you cry wolf 
Once too often
When you cry wolf 
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf 
I won't hear you 

You can try but you can't get me
Into the fire 
'Cause I'm out of sympathy 
And I can't walk this wire 
So find yourself somebody new 
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you 
And that's all 

When you cry wolf 
Once too often
When you cry wolf 
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf 
I won't hear you 
Baby baby, cry wolf
When you cry wolf
I won't hear you 
Anymore
