Don't you know
So many things they come and go 
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you 
And I remember the thunder 
Talkin' about that fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
And maybe baby maybe baby

I found someone to take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness
I've been feeling since you've been gone
Since you've been gone 

Dry your eyes 
I never could bear to see you cry 
Someday your love will shine through 
And show you the feelings you never really knew 
Baby don't you lose that thunder 
Talkin' about that fire in your eyes 
You're looking at me but you still don't believe 
And maybe baby maybe baby

I found someone to take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness
I've been livin' with since you've been gone
Since you've been gone 

Too long on the border line
Wonderin' if your love was really mine 
But you left me with open eyes 
And now I realize 

I found someone to take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness
I've been feeling since you've been gone

I found someone to take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness
I've been livin' with since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
