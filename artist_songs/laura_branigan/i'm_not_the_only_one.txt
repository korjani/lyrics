Secret eyes follow you around the room 
They try to hide their glances in the darkness
How could there be anyone as beautiful as you? 
Who couldn't help but want you?

I'm not the only one who wants to get next to you
Bet I'm not the only one who's ever told you 
How much they wanted to be your only one
They all wanted you, wanted to be holding you now 
Holding you, touching you, feeling you 

Will it be me at the end of the night? 
Will I be, will I be the lucky one who wins you? 
Leavin' the rest just to dream of your embrace 
Who wouldn't want to be in my place?

I'm not the only one who wants to get next to you 
Bet I'm not the only one who's ever told you 
How much they wanted to be your only one 
They all wanted you
You'll break every heart before the night is through 
Every heart but the one that goes with you

There you are, moving across the floor 
Knowing that all those arms are waiting and wanting 
Longing to reach for you 
You don't care, you could have anyone you choose 

I'm not the only one who wants to get next to you 
Bet I'm not the only one who's ever told you 
How much they wanted to be your only one 
They all wanted you, wanted to be holding you now 
Holding you, touching you, feeling you 
I wanna get next to you 
Bet I'm not the only one who's ever told you 
How much they wanted to be your only one
They all wanted you ... [fade out]
