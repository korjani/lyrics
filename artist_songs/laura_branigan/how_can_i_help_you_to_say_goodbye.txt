Through the back window of our '59 wagon 
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay

Mama whispered softly "Time will ease your pain" 
"Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same"
And she said

"How can I help you to say goodbye"
"It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry"
"Come let me hold you and I will try"
"How can I help you to say goodbye"

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away 

I called up mama she said "Time will ease your pain"
"Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same"
And she said

"How can I help you to say goodbye"
"It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry"
"Come let me hold you and I will try"
"How can I help you to say goodbye"

Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom 
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand 
She said "I have to go now my time here is over" 
And with her final words she tried to help me understand 

Mama whispered softly "Time will ease your pain"
"Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same"
And she said

"How can I help you to say goodbye"
"It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry"
"Come let me hold you and I will try"
"How can I help you to say goodbye"
