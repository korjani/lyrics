Oh, if I could touch you 
It'd be a once in a lifetime dream come true 
And oh, if I could have you 
Just one night, just one time
But I know I'll never get the chance
I'll never get a second glance

Never in a million years 
Never in a thousand tears 
If I could ever hold you 
I'd never let go 
Never in a million years

Oh, I need you 
If you could only see inside my heart
And oh, to be near you 
close enough, to reach and touch
well I've thought it over in my mind 
If I could walk across the bridge of time 

Never in a million years 
Never in a thousand tears 
If I could ever hold you 
I'd never let go
Never in a million years

But I know, I'll never, never, never get the chance 
I'll never get a second glance

Never in a million years 
Never in a thousand tears 
If I could ever hold you 
I'd never let go 
Never in a million years
Never Never in a million years 
Never in a thousand tears 
If I could ever hold you 
I'd never let go 
Never in a million years
