What's going on down on the planet
What's going on inside your pretty head 
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush

Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach 
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach 

I'm here for you 
No matter where you go no matter what you do 
I'm here for you 
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you 
Want you in my arms uncomplicated 
I am for you I am 

Who's gonna be the competition 
Who's next in line for promotion baby 
Everyday the real world is fading 
Spinning out on the wheel of fortune but 

Is it better than moonlight on water 
Is it better than sex on the beach 
Think about us riding wild horses 
Think about us it's not out of reach babe 

I'm here for you 
No matter where you go no matter what you do 
I'm here for you 
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you 
Want you in my arms uncomplicated 
I am for you I am 

You've been working so hard, don't you know it baby 
You don't understand what I want from you
Instead of dreamin' 'bout all that money
We got such simpler things to do 

Like moonlight on water 
Like sex on the beach 
Think about us riding wild horses 
Think about us it's not out of reach babe

I'm here for you 
No matter where you go no matter what you do 
I'm here for you 
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you 
Want you in my arms uncomplicated 
I am for you I am
But don't you worry 'bout the wrong things
