Oh I
Never knew
I was unkind
'Til I met you
So how
Can I believe
You will suffer with me
If I should ask you to

Bare the weight of me
Bottom belly legs chest hands feet face of me
Stare into space because of me
Dare to let nobody take the place of me
Why has it been so long
I long to be the one
You have a handle on

For I Never cared
To be led
Beyond my despair
And how
Strange to now see
Crumbs of deceit
Following me
So how can you

Bare the weight of me
Bottom belly legs chest hands feet face of me
Stare into space because of me
Dare to let nobody take the place of me
Why has been so long
I long to be the one
You
Have a handle
on.
