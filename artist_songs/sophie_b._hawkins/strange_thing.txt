In our lives Love has hid her face
To save her heart from breaking
Into feeling
In your eyes
Joy gives way to pain
Save your tears for the rain
Visions stop at the ceiling
Without each other
What would we be
We long to feel free
And in our dreams
We see
What we need

I hardly recognize myself, it's such a strange thing
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans
I've come so far and I've been so long away from home
I'd like a photograph whose image is still changing
The letter that I never sent to you explaining
All I want is a place for my heart to belong

In our minds
We have weapons and cures for disease
And a light year in the instant that it takes us to conceive
Without each other
Where will we go
Someday we will know
And if we want to
We will grow Closer and closer together

I hardly recognize myself, it's such a strange thing...
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans
I've come so far and I've been so long away from home
I'd like a photograph whose image is still changing
The letter that I never sent to you explaining
All I want is a place for my heart to belong
