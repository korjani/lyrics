I wanted to be loved
I wanted to be known
I wanted to be held
I wanted to be thrown
Into this world
I wanted to be your little girl
I wanted to be shy
I wanted to be dumb
I wanted to be blind
I wanted to be young
As a child
I wanted to feel myself
Worthwhile
You shot like star dust through me
And I wanted you to be
All that I would ever need
And my trial Is leaving now while I'm still strong
I wanted you to be the one
Though you knew it all along

I walk alone
God speed your love
God take me home
I walk alone
God be my judge
God still my soul

I tried to be your wife
I tried to be your friend
I tried to take my life
I tried to understand
How I failed In your eyes I can't prevail
There's nothing more that I can do
But carry on without you
Finding love in spite of truth
And I sail the seas of destiny's song
In my heart I may hold on
But you'll reach and I'll be gone

I walk alone
God speed your love
God take me home
I walk alone
God be my judge
God still my soul

I walk alone
In God I trust
Where I belong
I walk alone
In God I must
Proclaim my own
