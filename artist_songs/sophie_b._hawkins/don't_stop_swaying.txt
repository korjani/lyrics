I saw you there
All I wanted was to start with you
Was the hardest thing I ever had to do
'Til I made you care

Yo, brother
You sure heard me
Banging on the big drums for your love
You called me baby then
Talked to me like your best friend
When the time was right you were so good
Asked me what I like
And I said

Don't stop swaying, baby
You soothe my soul, and I stop searching
When I get lost in the rhythm
Everything stops hurting
Don't stop swaying, baby
Take it slow
And I keep yearning

Oh

Again I fall
Lighter than the morning dew (fresh)
'Cause I always never knew
What I'm stumbling on

(Yo, sister) yo, sister
(You sure heard me) you sure heard me
(Singing in the rain for some love) singing in the rain for some love
You took me unaware
Said things to make me care
Now, the time is ripe, and you're so good
Ask me what I like, and I say

Don't stop swaying, baby
You soothe my soul, and I stop searching
When I get lost in the rhythm
Everything stops hurting
Don't stop swaying, baby
Take it slow
And I keep yearning

Don't stop swaying, baby
You soothe my soul, and I stop searching
When I get lost in the rhythm
Everything stops hurting
Don't stop swaying, baby
Oh
And the Sun goes down
Don't stop swaying, baby

Hansel and Gretel are holding hands deep in the forest. They are lost.
This is their own story. The two have fallen in love, and so, after a long quietness amidst the creatures of the night, they begin to kiss.
Traveling like heat through each other's bodies, they pass through centuries of insecurity and into a rhythm where they are not afraid.
(Don't stop swaying baby)
Mamma has led these children into the wild unknown for reasons known, with father's help, of course,
they tried very hard to get back home, but, of course, they could not.
(Don't stop swaying baby)
And so, they find themselves through the darkness, through the sadness, making love, making peace, making music.
They find themselves, through the chaos, making sense. This is what they want. This is who they are. These are the things they need.
When the Sun goes down
(Don't stop swaying baby)
And I'm next to you
(Don't stop swaying baby)
Oh
(Don't stop swaying baby)
