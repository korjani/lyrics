I cannot claim
Life is more than a game
Sometimes
I
Crave to behave
In the absense of care
I know I'll never keep happiness there
Oh but when he ran his hands through my hair
I stopped believing that winning by cheating's unfair

And I have not seen
Life is more than a dream
Sometimes
I
Seem to be fine
In the absense of time
I know I'll never find reason or rhyme
More exciting than the sound of his sighs
I stopped believing this dream that I'm weaving is mine
Oh

Try with your vicious greed
To cast off your need for me
Try to run free of me
Crawl on your knees for me
Why are you so afraid
To lose what's not yours to save
To savour the sweetest taste for free

I can't pretend
Love goes on without end
Sometimes
I
Need to be free
Of a passion or three
I guess the fruit can't fall far from the tree
Dare I imagine what I might find waiting for me
Trust me I'll only be true to my own destiny
So

Try with your vicious greed
To cast off your need for me
Try to run free of me
Crawl on your knees for me
Why are you so afraid
To lose what's not yours to save
To savour the sweetest taste for free
Sometimes
I see
