Mmm my best friend has a little car
She can take off anywhere, anytime she wants
And if you ask me mostly
Where would I rather be
I'll tell you up and down the avenue
In the passenger seat.

My best friend
Has fuzzy hair
My best friend
Walks with her tail in the air
My best friend
Makes me feel full as the moon
I'm saving all my money and I'm gonna take her to
Israel soon.

Mmm my best friend has a little house
She gave me my own keys and I go Anytime I want
And if you ask me mostly
Where would I rather be
I'll tell you sitting on the window sill
When she's close to me.
(I worried I was isolated now I'm glad I waited For the real thing)

My best friend
Has fuzzy hair
My best friend
Walks with her tail in the air
My best friend
Makes me feel full as the moon
I'm saving all my money and I'm gonna take her to
Israel soon
My best friend
She smells like patchouli and cigarettes and the street
My best friend
Sometimes she makes eyes at my feet
My best friend
You'd think we were from the same womb
We don't like talking in the morning
And we dream all afternoon.

Wear big clothes and you're alright
Don't let the spin make you uptight
Life's a Saturday morning cartoon
We're like balloons we're like balloons
We come as one and we stand on line
We don't mind waiting 'cause we're on our own time
We don't know what the meaning could be
It's a mix of love and ecstasy
