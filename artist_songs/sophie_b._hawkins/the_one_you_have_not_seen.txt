I want to walk beside you
Nowhere that I have ever been
And of the dreams inside you
I am the one you have not seen

You make me feel a school girl
Restless to take your point of view
Into my mystery world
Finding that one is more than two

I feel abused
By my own mind
I can't refuse
An offer to make love to you

How come your words affect me
I have not wanted to be bound
And yet I may be set free
Before the meaning was the sound

In your refrain
I hear the chords of love in vain
How can I help but call your name

From dusk 'til dawn
I'm haunted
By your demon song
Don't make me play alone too long
