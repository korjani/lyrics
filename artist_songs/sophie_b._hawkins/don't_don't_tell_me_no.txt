I never thought that I could
Crash upon your sandy shores
And like the feeling of your warm security
It's not like me

Now I come with strange excitement
At your very touch I'm frightened
Don't I ask too much you tell me
'Long as I can keep on yelling

Don't don't tell me no
I want you to take my hand
Never ever let it go
Even if I make you mad
Darlin' every bit of love give
You will get more back
If you believe it

Who cares if it's forever
There's no time when we're together
Who cares if we don't worry
We don't even have to hurry

This is our world awaiting
For the sweetest penetrating
Love that we have found
Why don't we splatter it around and around

Don't don't tell me no
I want you to take my hand
Never ever let it go
Even if I make you mad
Darlin' every bit of love give
You will get more back
If you believe it

Don't don't tell me no
I want you to take my hand
Never ever let it go
Even if I make you mad
Darlin' every bit of love give
You will get more back
If you believe it

Why don't you stay
You make me laugh like it's forever
And cry like I have never
You heal my pain
Why can't we pray
Let's take the time to feel the weather
And love the world together
It's the only way

Don't don't tell me no
I want you to take my hand
Never ever let it go
Even if I make you mad
Darlin' every bit of love give
You will get more back
If you believe it
[repeat twice]
