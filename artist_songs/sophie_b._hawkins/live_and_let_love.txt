I busted homes
I gave up everything I own
To come in here
Now, ain't it clear I'm true?
Baby, you've changed
But ain't I just the same
As the little girl
Who's gonna give her world to you?
Don't break my heart again
I'm closing this door
Kiss me
Kiss me once more
You're the one who taught me how to do it

Love and let love be our desire
Live and let life be our fire
Stand by yourself, and I'll stand by you
Live and let love be our truth

These walls are high (ah)
But I was born to climb
I've got a monkey mind
And I will always find the groove
I trust your rhythm
So do what you feel
Kiss me
Kiss me for real, oh, darling
I'm the one who'll show you now to do it

Love and let love be our desire
Live and let life be our fire
Stand by yourself, and I'll stand by you (ah)
Live and let love be our truth
Love and let love be our desire (ah)
Live and let life be our fire
Stand by yourself, and I'll stand by you (ah)
Live and let love be our truth

Yeah
