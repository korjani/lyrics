(Carry me)

Do you love your mother
The way I love mine
Expecting nothing of her
'Cause she was changing all the time?
I couldn't take my mother
And I'll never hate my home
But I learned to rock myself, child
And get on (carry me)

Do you feel your mother
The way I feel mine?
I tried to change the nature
But now, I like it, 'cause it's mine
And I let you love me up
And I let you bring me home
And I could go away
But I don't wanna (carry me)

I don't wanna be too smart
I don't wanna talk too fast
I don't wanna look too precious
First impressions never last
There's always complications
Weird vibrations
Frustrations
Have patience (carry me)

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (carry me)

Do you love your mother? (yeah)
'Cause, God, I love mine
In a dream she let me love her
Gotta hand it to my mind
In case you never meet her
I'll tell you what it is
She was lonely like a woman
But she was just a kid (carry me)

Oh, Mama, yeah
What are ya doin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oo (carry me)
Oh
What are ya doin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (carry me)
Mama, oo
Oh
Shit
Yeah, oh, yeah (carry me)
Uh-huh, Mama
Don't know what to do (carry me)
Oh
Oh, Ma
In a dream she let me love her
In a dream she let me move her
(Carry me)
