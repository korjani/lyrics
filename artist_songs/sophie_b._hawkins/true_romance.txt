Try
To make me run away
I will only hang around and wait
For you
I could never fall too fast
I've found my true love at last

In you
And it would make me cry
If you should ever leave my side
Darling put your hand in mine
Come with me now we can fly

To paradise
How can we doubt it
We can't live without it
So fine

Come
Into my open wounds
Don't ask me if I'd die for you
Darling it's not worth living
Under any other circumstance
This is a true
This is a true romance
