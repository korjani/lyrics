I'm a wounded soldier on a downtown train to your place
You've launched a secret heart with your face
You don't always say what I want to hear but you move me
Across the rooftops and into the deep blue sea

Did we not choose each other
Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you 
And mine is the heart I will save

I drew a hard line but I just can't see it
Your colours are bleeding all over my bullshit
I wanna be your star but I gotta learn to feel myself
I want your love and I need your help

Did we not choose each other
Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you
And mine is the heart I will save
Can we not judge each other
I'd rather wipe your tears away
I can follow my heart till the end
But I just can't choose the way

Just because we live like dolphins together
So many reasons to break the wave
We can swim from streetlamp to streetlamp
We can be kissing in the rain

Can we not judge each other
I'd rather wipe your tears away
I can follow my heart till the end
But I just can't choose the way

Listen baby, listen baby don't you do me wrong
I can make my bed, you can sing your song
Ain't nobody else gonna make you shine
If it's the truth you seek then darlin' love you'll find
I don't wanna, I don't wanna take your pain away
Isn't yours to give, isn't mine to save
Here's my heart, here's my hand, here's my soul
Take it in, take it apart, take it easy, let it go
[repeat three times]
