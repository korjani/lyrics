With fists raised high in tightened knots 
The room explodes and now this blood is on your hands 
And there is no time for a second chance 
To paint my face with blood and tears and cover up 
In an open book that no one reads 
A misspelled word that no one know 
You stole the rain 
Then you turned around and tore my life in two 
Just like the picture that once hung on the wall in the room that we used to share 
So fold me up and put me back in the place where you used to keep your heart 

You think its getting smaller? 
It's been that way for quite some time now 

The cadence beats down on the tar 
It sounds the same as your fists raining down 
(if you wanted to change the way I look at you...) 
We've got to leave before the sun sets 
Or maybe we don't have time(time to waste.) 
It won't be long until you're gone into the night 
You won't have time to paint my face with cover-up
