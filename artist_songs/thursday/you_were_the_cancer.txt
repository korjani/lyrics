It's the sigh of a building falling down 
It's the world spinning us around 
It's the slip of the surgeon's knife 
Darker crimes of common existence 
It's a missile sleeping in the ground 
It's a camera trying to photograph a sound 
It's a case for the basic flaw 
Ending a film in the coming attractions 
It's a sound that's spinning out of control 
It's a light at the edge of a black hole 
Scream of an orchestra 
Total collapse of an overreaction 

In your blood there is a sad, sad song 
Bleeding through your nervous system 
It's killing you but it's bringing me along 
You were the cancer in my life 
You were the cancer all the time 
You were the cancer 
That's all you'll ever be 

It's comfort in a bathtub full of ice 
It's the promise of a peaceful afterlife 
Or the string of a violin wound too tight 
It's gasping for oxygen 
It's the signal that's sent out over the air 
At the speed of a thousand unheard prayers 
Faith in the chemicals 
A shot in the dark the size of a particle 
It's blood from the neon sign 
Shine a light away from your insides 
Make a map of the balance 
Watching life slip through your hands 
They're not for shaking 
They're not for praying 
They're just for holding close 
Everything you love that is fragile in a dream 

See, you're coming down 
Noone knows where 
See, you're coming down 
Without a prayer 

You were the cancer in my life 
You were the cancer all the time 
You were the cancer 
That's all you'll ever be 

Your blood is a sad, sad song 
Bleeding through your nervous system 
It's killing you but it's bringing me along 

It's a sound that's spinning out of control 
It's a light at the edge of a black hole 
Scream of an orchestra 
Total collapse of an overreaction 

You were the cancer in my life 
You were the cancer all the time 
You were the cancer 
That's all you'll ever be 
You were the cancer in my life 
You were the cancer all the time 
You were the cancer 
That's all you'll ever be
