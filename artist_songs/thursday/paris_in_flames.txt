Now it's time to wrap our fears in the night 
And on the first day I'll dress this city in flames 
After all the things you say 
You hate me for being this way 

Still you won't let go of old ideals 
There is no headline to read at night 
When the record skips and you're not holding the needle 

We all sing the songs of separation 
And we watch our lives bleed out through our hands 
That's how it was on the first day 
When we saw Paris in Flames 

Rain, rain down
I think it's going to rain, rain down [x2]
I think it's going to rain
I think it's going to rain, rain down [x3]
I think it's going to rain

Here in this collapsed lung of a borough 
There is no sunlight 
The sunlight is manufactured in a windowless room 
Distant and incoherent 
Businessmen hang themselves 

We all sing the songs of separation 
And we watch our lives bleed out through our hands 
That's how it was on the first day 
When we saw Paris in Flames 

The lower east side is a jukebox playing the deadman's crescendo 
The needle is a vector 
An intersection that we all must cross
A dimly lit hallway where shadows of moths decorate the walls 
Discard this message
Discard this message
Discard this message
(Burn this city down, down...)

Discard this message 
Throw this bottle back in the ocean 
Rip this page from the history books 
Smash all the street signs 
Erase all the maps 
Forget my name 
Forget my face 
Forget my name 
Because it's going to rain (it's going to rain)
And it never ends

Rain, rain down
I think it's going to rain, rain down [x2]
I think it's going to rain
I think it's going to rain, rain down [x3]
I think it's going to rain

(We all sing the songs of separation 
And we watch our lives bleed out through our hands 
That's how it was on the first day 
We saw Paris in Flames)
