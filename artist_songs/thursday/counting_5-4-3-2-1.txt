5-4-3-2-1 Lets start a fire. 
We'll burn this town from inside out.
Till no ones left alive. 
And you can't feel the rhythm of your steps when you hit the street. 
The city seems so far away from here, when you're counting every step.

5-4-3-2 what are you waiting for?
The train is catching up, keep on running don't look back.
Cause it's 10-9-8-7 everybody's coming to burn this city, burn this city down tonight. 
Leave it all behind. 

All his life he lived in this same house. 
Same white fence surrounding him, he swore he would get out. 
But he can't cause his foot got caught in between the rails. 
And all his friends were up ahead 
They can't hear him yelling, yelling for some help. 
And it's much too late to call the doctor now. 
This town is full of sympathies; we're drowning in it all.

Is that the sound of the gate coming down? No flashing lights, no warning?
When we press our ears to the ground we feel the shake. 
But it's under the skin, so we wilt like violets.
Can't get up, to put the petals in their place. 

5-4-3-2 What are you waiting for?
Burn this city, burn this city tonight.
