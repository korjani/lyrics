Lights out on Division Street
and all the hate that rises 
through the cracks in the pavement, 
as the temperature falls. 
(This is where is hits the ground)

Lights out on Division Street
I'm repeating
Goodbye to the memories, 
(the fever that will not break)
the night is pouring down,
it's not enough to put this out,
i'll burn up before i wake up. 
(on Division Street) 
This is serious, 
This is serious, 
If this is serious
I'll hide my heart in dark parades.

Lights out on Division Street
I held you tight like an empty bottle...
But the glass broke 
(and the poison spilled out of your mouth)
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? 
The house turned black and sat in silence
(while a mockingbird sang)
lalalalalala, listen to yourself
go on and on, as if you spoke to someone else.

Lights out on Division Street
I'm repeating
Goodbye to the memories, 
(the fever that will not break)

(on Division Street) 
This is serious, 
This is serious, 
If this is serious
I'll hide my heart in dark parades.

To dance between the scissor's blades
without getting cut.
I drew an X on your city's name 
LIGHTS OUT. BLACK OUT. BLOW OUT THE CANDLE AGAIN. 
spin the room around 
FALL DOWN. PASS OUT. GET UP. I CAN'T KEEP REPEATING.

Between the footsteps I hear crickets in the trees 
a silent army marching with me through a swarm of bees 
a needle dragged across a record slowing down 
along Division St. the lights were dying out 
endless rows of houses stretched on for miles and miles and miles...
TURN THE WINDOWS BLACK 
Lights out on Division Street 
repeating (repeat it) 
Lights out on Division Street 
repeating, (turn the windows black) 
lights out. lights out. lights out. 
turn the windows black 
la la la la la la
listen to yourself.
