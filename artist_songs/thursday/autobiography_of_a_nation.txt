Write these words back down inside 
We have burned their villages and all the people in them died 
We adopt their customs and everything they say we steal 
All the dreams they had we kill 
Still we all sleep sound tonight 
Is this what you wanted to hear? 
We erased all their images and dance 
And replaced them with borders and flags 

At the top of this timeline you'll remember 
This is the lipstick on the collar 
And in my own life I've seen it in the mirror 
sometimes at the cost of others hopes 

So write these words back down inside 
That's where you need it the most 
and without conviction of heart you will never feel it at all 
Yeah, we all dance to the same beat when we we're marching 
Yeah, the TV tells us everythign we need to know 
And this scene is painting in all the fashions of the moment 
And history is all the same 

Everything you say you stole 
Every dream you dream you bought
