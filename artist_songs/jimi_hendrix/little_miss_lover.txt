Little Miss Lover, where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover that feels like you, would you like to tag along?

Well, I really don't need any help little girl,
But I think you could help me out anyway
Would you believe, baby, I've been looking for a Sun
That feels like you For some time

Excuse me while I see if the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind

Well, he signals me O.K.
So I think it's safe to say,
I'm gonna make a play, ohhh yeah!
Hey, hey, little Miss Lover,
There's so much you and me can discover
And I think we should start, start right now
Hey little Miss Lover!
