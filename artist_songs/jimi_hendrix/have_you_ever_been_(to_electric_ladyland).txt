Have you ever been (have you ever been) to Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits, for you.
So don't you be late
Oh, (I wanna show you), the different emotions
(I wanna run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride, 
we can cast all of your hang-ups over
the seaside.
While we fly right over the love filled sea 
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand.

Make love, make love, make love, make love.

(I wanna show you)
The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings
(I wanna show you)
Good and evil lay side by side while electric love penetrates the sky
(I wanna show you)
Lord, Lord I wanna show you
(I wanna show you)
Hmm, hmmm, hmmm
(I wanna show you)
Show you
(I wanna show you)
