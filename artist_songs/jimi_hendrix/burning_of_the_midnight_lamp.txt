The morning is dead
And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
But It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me
Too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone
Burn
Lonely, Lonely, Lonely

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit and pace
That same old fireplace
Gives rise to the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time me tell,
About the circus and the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

And I continue
To burn the same old lamp
Lone

Yeah
Lightnin', can ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna blow my mind
Yeah, yeah
Lonely lonely
My my
