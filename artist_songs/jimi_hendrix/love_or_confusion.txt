Is that the stars in the sky or is it raining far from now?
Will it burn me if I touch the sun,
so bit, so round?
Will I be truthful, yeah,
in choosing you as the one for me?

Is this love baby,
or is it-a just confusion?

Oh, my mind is so mixed up, goin' round 'n' round_
Must there be all these colors without names,
without sounds?
My heart burns with feelin' but
Oh! but my mind is cold and reeling.

Is this love, baby
or is it confusion?

Oh, my head is pounding pounding
going 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round.
Must there always be these colors?
