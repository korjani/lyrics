Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say.
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say.

But I know for sure
I Don't Live Today.

No sun coming through my windows,
feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave.
No sun coming through my windows,
feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave.

I wish you'd hurry up 'n' rescue me
so I can be on my mis'rable way

I Don't Live Today;
It's such a shame to waste you time away like this.

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say.
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say

But I know for sure
I Don't Live Today.
