I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flyin' on a midnight flight

All I got for you is me
So darlin' can't you see
We'll make love all through the night
Make love all through the night

Lay your troubles down on the chair
You've got to shake those blues right out your hair

I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flyin' makin' a midnight flight
