Burning desire sets my soul on fire
Burning desire sets my soul on fire
I feel my body drowning in your sea of love
But in the meantime there's nothing to dream

Between Hell and Heaven you just may see me chase my heart everywhere
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

Last night sure was sweet
It sure was good this time around
You really sent me around and around, round and round

You came on down hard on me baby
You showed me just how love could be
I wish I could stay baby
But I'm just a night bird flying over the sea
And I'm trying not to drown

Burning desire hotter than an electric chair
