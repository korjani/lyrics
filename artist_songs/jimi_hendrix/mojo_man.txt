Flames!
I see electric flames yall
They are burning all over
All over me.
Voodoo, Voodoo
That’s what they call it now
And ya best better
Gone and let it be
But I’ve always been a gambling man
So you know I’m gonna, gonna, gonna take a chance
This why cause,
Can’t love electric flames
Though it can fuck with me
Cause I’m, I’m a Mojo Man
And I’m from
Let me tell ya, I’m from Voodoo Land
Mojo Man
From a far away land
Gotta change anything yall, anything
With the touch of hand
You made me
whoever you may be
Just take my voodoo ingenuity
I was raised in a land way back
Near a Fiji land
With a one eyed toad, just walking, in the palm of my hand
Devils, troubles, witches prove
Every girl to me
And old black cats, were my company
So you know I wasn’t alone
Mojo Man
From a far away land
Gotta change anything y'all, anything
With the touch of hand
You made me
whoever you want to be
Just take a little voodoo ingenuity
Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo, Mojo Man now
I’m a Mojo Man
I’m a say it
I’m a Mojo Man
I’m a Mojo Man
