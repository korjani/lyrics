Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go

But don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name,
All over the place

Well, do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor,
From an old fruit jar

Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, go, go

But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
