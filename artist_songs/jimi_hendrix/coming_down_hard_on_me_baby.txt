Come on down hard on me baby
Come on down hard as you can
Come on down hard on me baby
Lord, come on down hard as you can
Come on down hard on me baby
Show me that I'm your lover man

Come on down hard juicy
Turn me into jelly bread
Bring that love down hard on me baby
Rock me, rock me right through the bed
Come on down hard on me baby
Please show me I'm your lover man

I want to love you so much 'til I hope we can make it
I want to love you so much 'til I hope I don't break it
I want to love you so much 'til I can't stand it
I want to love you so strong 'til you've got to say you've had it
Yeah
