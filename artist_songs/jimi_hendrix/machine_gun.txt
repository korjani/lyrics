"Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have
A million or two million more of them... if we
Can get over this summer, he he he 
Right, I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene
That's goin' on all the soldiers that are fightin'
In Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... oh yes, and
All the soldiers fightin' in vietnam. like to do
A thing called 'machine gun'."

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my ax and fight like a bomber
(you know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down

Hey I pick up my ax and fight like a bomber now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground

The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun

Oooooooooo

I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain

'cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no no

Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright
No bullets
At least here, huh huh
No guns, no bombs
Huh huh
No nothin', just let's all live and live
You know instead of killin'
