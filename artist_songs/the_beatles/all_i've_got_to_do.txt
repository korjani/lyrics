Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
yeah that's all I gotta do

And when I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin' you

And the same goes for me, whenever you want me at all

You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me

And when I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do is call you on the phone

And the same goes for me, whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes I will, whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me. Oh, you just gotta call on me
