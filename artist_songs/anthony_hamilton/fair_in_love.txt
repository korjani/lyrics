How many times have you searched and just gave up on love
Having the same batch of luck that never amounts to much
Seems nothing ever matches up
I'm ready to let it all go for good

Wonder where does love go
I'm in need of someone
You know
Lonely never have fun
I'll be waiting with open arms

Love comes thru open doors
Be ready when she comes
Stepping in your life
Cause all
All is fair in love
You gotta give it up
Can't just walk the line

Got your life all tied up in work and so should they
Only make time to get up go to work and home again
Seem the only one lonely is you
O love O love O love O love I'm waiting on you

Wonder where does love go
I'm in need of someone
You know
Lonely never have fun
And I'll be waiting with open arms

Love comes thru open doors
Be ready when she comes
Stepping in your life
Cause all
All is fair in love
You gotta give it up
Can't just walk the line

Where do the lonely go
Whose gonna care for those
Love them care for them

Love comes thru open doors
Be ready when she comes
Stepping in your life
Cause all
All is fair in love
You gotta give it up
Can't just walk the line
