She's like a medicine
I can't get her out my veins
Take any ole prescription
As long as she comes with it
The side effects I feel
Is that I need her
I'm dreaming so damn hard
It's on me for real

Tell me what's up you
I gotta know
I want to choose you as my habit
Let's have it
I got to make it known
You're all I need
The only thing that I want

She's really more, more than enough
My love is innocent
Because I am so into her
She's all I want
I've take the plunge

And I've fall-en heels over head
Madly in love
She's more than enough
She's more than enough

She's got mad appeal
Something about her about her
That keeps me intrigued
The simple things are ritious

She's worth praying about
It's getting harder
To fall asleep at night
Without her by my side

She's really more, more than enough
My love is so innocent
Because I am so into her
She's all I want
I've taken the plunge

And I've fall-en heels over head
Madly in love
She's more than enough
She's more than enough

You're worth the world
I'll give it all
Anything to please you
Use all of my time
Use it as you like
I just want to be with you
She's really, more than enough
My love is so innocent
Because I am so into her
She's all I want
I've taken the plunge

And I've fall-en heels over head
Madly in love
She's more than enough
She's more than enough

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything I've ever wanted
Everything I need
