Take a look over your shoulder
Wise words get much older
Life has a way of humbling you down
Thought you already knew it
Took a turn then you blew it
Life has a way of humbling you down

So I think I already know every thing
So I think there ain't room to grow everything
Life humbles you down

As I stare at the ceiling
In an abandoned building
Life had a way of knocking me around
And my children still look up to me
While their stomachs on empty
Oh I need an angel to fall on me now

So I thought I already know every thing
So I thought there wasn't room to grow everything
Oh Life humbles you down
Humbles you down
Oh life has a way of humbling you down
Humbles you down
Oh life has a way of humbling you down

Just when I though that I knew
Oh just when I thought I knew it all,
Oh I thought I knew it all
There was a lesson in store
There was a lesson in store for me
Changed my whole world now I know
Changed my world, now I know, I know
I don't know it all

There's always room left to grow
There's always room left to grow
There's always room left to grow
