I've been wantin' so long to be next to you
And I ain't got the nerve but to tell ya
Baby, you keep me up through the nighttime
Thinkin' 'bout your love and affection

And I've been drawn to you
And I hope you feel the same
And if I could have my way
I'd spend my life with you, fallin' in love

Oh, it just hit me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love, baby love, baby love
And oh, come get with me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love, baby love, baby love

For a moment our eyes had connected
With no questions on warmest affection
Don't choose to act, it's a no dance
At that moment, you heart filled with laughter

Don't lie 'bout how you feel
That chance might slip away
And if I could have my way
I'd spend my life with you, fallin' in love

Oh, it just hit me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love, baby love, baby love
And oh, come get with me, hey baby
I feel like fallin' in love

Take it easy, don't you take so long
One day you might find
This love will be gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone

Oh, it just hit me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love
And oh, come get with me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love

Oh, it just hit me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love
And oh, come get with me, oh
I feel like fallin' in love

I feel like fallin'
I feel like fallin'
I feel like fallin' in love, baby
I feel like fallin' in love, baby
