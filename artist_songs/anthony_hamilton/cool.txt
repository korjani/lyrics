We don't have to worry bout no money, to have us a real good time 
and we don't have to leave in the morning, the whole day just you and I, 
and it don't have to get any better, it's perfect you in my life. 

If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 

We don't have to worry bout no groceries, we can fill up on love alone, 
If we ain't got enough for a movie, we can just sit at home 
Have a little role play baby, whatever turns you on 

If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 

Quit your worrying baby 
Quit your worrying girl 
Quit your crying lady 
We can conquer the world 

Pack a lil love for the evening, let me hold you tight 
Don't be worried about my problems believe me - everything's gonna be alright 
... watching cartoons, whatever makes you smile 

If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 

Quit your worrying baby 
Quit your worrying girl 
Quit your crying lady 
We can conquer the world 

Ain't nobody worried bout no money, and we still gonna have a good time 
Like JJ, Thelma, and Willona, we gonna have a good time 
We can take a stroll in the park, holding hands walking side by side 
Drop the top down on the lac, feel the breeze and take a lil ride 
You know I love the southern stuff baby 
Fish and chicken with the hot fries 
And we a perfect match, I'm the ham and you the good collard greens on the side 

Don't worry girl 
Don't worry.. No 
We're alright 
Hold On, Hold On 

Quit your worrying baby 
Quit your worrying girl 
Quit your crying lady 
We can conquer the world 
We can conquer the world
