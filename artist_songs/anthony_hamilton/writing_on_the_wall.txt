People talking 'bout how you runnin' 'round,
Wylin' out, how you been livin' life
Said you steppin' out
I tell you, I just can't complain
Got me feeling good, girl you feed me good
They've got you misunderstood
I'm wish a nigga would try and mess up everything

[Hook:]
See the writing on the wall,
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna listen no, no
People talking everywhere,
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, but I hear...

They call you Hollywood, Mrs. Hollywood
Tarnish your name and drag it out through the hood
I don't wanna go, paddelin down this dusty road
Mind your business, if she ain't or if she is, I don't wanna know
I'm gonna keep holding on

[Hook:]
See the writing on the wall,
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna listen no, no
People talking everywhere,
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, oh but I hear

Everything
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright...
I don't wanna hear that
It's my life, it's my life...
And I'm grown
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright baby
It's my life...
Cause I'm grown

[Hook: w/adlibs]
See the writing on the wall,
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna hear nothing, nothing, nothing from no one
People talking everywhere,
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, I don't wanna hear a thing no

See the writing on the wall,
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna hear it, hear it, hear it
People talking everywhere,
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen

I don't wanna listen
To nothing from no one
