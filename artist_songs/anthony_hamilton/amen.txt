Amen, amen, amen

Didn't see her coming
Hell, it's like I've been running
Is my mind playing tricks on me?
Or is she one up on me?
If I had to testify I could only say she's the truth
It's like prayers went up and sent me you
Now I wasn't looking, I was fine on my own
Could come and go as I please, nobody questioning me
I don't know when things began to change
You came and turned it all around

Got me saying Amen
From the bed to the stove
From the church to the job
Best thing I know
Got me saying Amen
Girl you looking good
You keep that cooking good
Best thing for sure

Your love starts settling, settling on me
Like a kid in a blanket, made it hard for me to leave
And you gave me new love, the kind I never ever seen
And I'm eternally thankful

Got me saying Amen
From the bed to the stove
From the church to the job
Best thing I know
Got me saying Amen
Girl you looking good
You keep that cooking good
Best thing for sure

Got me saying Amen
From the bed to the stove
From the church to the job
Best thing I know
Got me saying Amen
Girl you looking good
You keep that cooking good
Best thing for sure

It's hard for me to picture
Not being right here witcha
Look what I've been missing
You turned it all around
Look what I done found
Blocking my own blessings

And if I knew then what I know right now
I would've settled down a long time ago
And if I hadn't met you, where would I be?
You got me on bending knees

Got me saying Amen
From the bed to the stove
From the church to the job
Best thing I know
Got me saying Amen
Girl you looking good
You keep that cooking good
Best thing for sure

Got me saying Amen
From the bed to the stove
From the church to the job
Best thing I know
Got me saying Amen
Girl you looking good
You keep that cooking good
Best thing for sure

It's hard for me to picture
Not being right here witcha
Look what I've been missing
You turned it all around
Look what I done found
Blocking my own blessings

And if I knew then what I know right now
I would've settled down a long time ago
And if I hadn't met you, where would I be?
You got me on bending knees

Got me saying Amen
