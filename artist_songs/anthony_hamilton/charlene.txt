[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote 
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road 
To hard to swallow being alone 
She needs someone at night that she can hold 
She must have told me a thousand times before 
Silent cries I use to ignore 
God knows I love her 
Didn't mean to hurt her 

[Chorus] 
Baby I'll be 
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again 
I won't leave 
Promise I'll be here to the very end 
By your side 
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life 
Come on home to me Charlene 

[Verse 2]
She knows I really love this old music thang 
Since I was a child it's been my dream 
I can support her treat her and spoil her 
You know buy her the finer things 
But I forgot about loving her 
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls 
What about the hard day she had with the baby 
All she need is for me to love her 

[Chorus]

[Bridge] 
Promise I can't live without her 
God knows I need her loving 
And it hurts so bad that's she gone 
I pray that she'll come back one day 
In my life

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh 
Sometimes I cry 
Charlene if you're listening would you call on me 
Because my heart is aching
