You say you wanna walk out, you say you wanna leave
I can tell by the way we make love
You say things you don't believe
It's like your mind says no, but your heart is sayin' yes
I felt the warning signs about a week ago
So I try to confuse you with happiness
Yes I did

See God only knows
How you really are feeling inside
So I sat down with Venus
And she said you're runnin' with lovin' this guy.

Baby I'm missing you crazy, I'm missing you like crazy
I've been thinking, drowning, sinking, wondering
Who's loving you lady, I'm missing you crazy
I've been thinking, drowning, sinking, wondering
Who's loving you now

All my friends say you're gonna be okay
But days have turned to weeks
And Marches have turned to May
You said you wanna be alone girl
But I see you holding his hand
Cause love is your religion girl, you might hate the song
But you love the pain, yes you do

See God only knows
How you really are feeling inside
So I sat down with Venus
And she said you're runnin' with lovin' this guy.

Baby I'm missing you crazy, I'm missing you like crazy
I've been thinking, drowning, sinking, wondering
Who's loving you lady, I'm missing you crazy
I've been thinking, drowning, sinking, wondering
Who's loving you now
