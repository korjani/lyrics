It's simple, I love it, having you near me, having you here
Our conversations, outrageous,
You smile, and I smile then I say
Oooh, this getting personal, personal, personal
Let's stay for a while and play
Girl let's make this a moment (ooohhhhh!)

Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, oh!
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me

Good morning, here's breakfast
Lost track of time but, we had a ball
Let's catch a movie, then dinner
Tonight's the night we'll
Just unwind, and stay, hey
Let's stay personal, personal, personal
Let's stay for a while and play
Such a beautiful moment

Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing,
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me
Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing,
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me [x2]
