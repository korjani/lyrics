Can't believe this is happening

Stand here looking in the mirror
Saying damn to myself
I was flipping through her cell phone pictures
That's when I saw somebody else
Now she told me he was just a friend
But friends don't send pictures like that
I didn't even start an argument
Grabbed my louis bags and packed thinking
(Why) why you wanna do this to me
(We) we were supposed to get married
Did you ever stop to think at all
This will tear a hole in me
Did you ever even care at all
That I'd be questioning

[Chorus:]
(Will I ever love again) will I ever love again
(Will I ever trust again) will I ever trust again
(Will I ever feel again)
The kinda of love that I felt for her
Until then I'll just be a broken man

I wish I didn't really care
I would chalk it all up
But I now I have to cancel the engagement
And tell all my folks
Return the tux, the ring, the keys to everything (everything)
I guess I gotta let her go
And she'll be thinking
(Why) why you wanna do this to me
(We) we were supposed to get married
Did you ever stop to think at all
This will tear hole in me
I know I have to move on
But the question

[Chorus:]
(Will I ever love again) will I ever love again
(Will I ever trust again) say will I ever trust again
(Will I ever feel again)
The kinda of love that I felt for her
Until then I'll just be a broken man

(Why) why you wanna do this to me
(We) we were supposed to get married
Did you even stop to think at all
This will tear a hole in me
I know I have to move on
But the question

[Chorus:]
(Will I ever love again) will I ever love again
(Will I ever trust again) say will I ever trust again
(Will I ever feel again)
The kinda of love that I felt for her
Until then I'll just be a broken man
