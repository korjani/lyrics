Ladies & Gentlement
We got Anthony Hamilton in the house tonight he just came from off tour..he got a little
Somthing he wanna say

[verse 1]
I know you love me
I can tell by the that you kiss me tight when you hug me 
Took me to school the very first day u gave me a piece of butterscotch sent me on my way
I know its frightening now i can tell by the pain in your eyes when the rent was late again To
Strong to fold being on your own Lord bless her soul....mama knows love 

[Chorus]
Mama knew love like the back roads 
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes 
Mom swear you never have to worry again 
Mama knew love like the back streets 
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet 
Mom swear you never have to worry again 

[Verse 2]
Up bright and early scrambled eggs swellin' in ya legs bills on the bed 
Still you managed to show me a smile 
Then walk to work about two or three miles 
Mom I'm gonna struggle witcha 
I'm gonna help you see the bigger picture 
You gave me something no one could take away 
You made it so easy to say...I love ya mama 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Mama knew love she gave me love 
Crazy love so much love 
Mama knew love she gave me love 
Crazy love so much love

[Chorus]
[Repeat 3X]
[Ad lib out......]
