(To each his own, to each his own)

A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you

What good is a song if the words just don't belong?
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own
For me, there's you

If a flame is to grow, there must be a glow
To open each door, there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means so much to me

Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I found my own
One and only you

Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I found my own
One and only you
