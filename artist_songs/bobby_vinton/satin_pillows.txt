Satin pillows to cry on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
You've got nothing else to rely on 
You gave up the most precious thing in life 
You turned from love to be a rich man's wife 
The man you married is colder than all his gold 
You're something he bought to keep from growing old 

Now you've got satin pillows to cry on 
Satin pillows tro cry on 
You've got nothing else to rely on 
And you've got fancy dresses and big cars 
Diamonds that outshine the brightest stars 
But diamonds can't replace the love we knew 
They won't keep you warm like my arms used to 
Now you've got satin pillows to cry on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
You've got nothing else to rely on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
Satin pillows to cry on.
