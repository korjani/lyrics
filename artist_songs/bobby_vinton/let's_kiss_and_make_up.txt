Last night we had a quarrel 
And I lost my head 
How silly of me to say 
The things I said 

Let's kiss and make up 
Why should we break up 
Say it's not too late yet 
To forgive and forget 

Funny but it doesn't matter now 
Who was wrong or right 
Darling all that matters now 
Is that I miss you tonight 

Let's kiss and make up 
Why should we break up 
Say it's not too late yet 
To forgive and forget 

'Cause I'd do anything 
To be with you again 

Let's kiss and make up 
Why should we break up 
Say it's not too late yet 
To forgive and forget
