I'm coming home I'm coming,
I'm coming home I'm coming home.

Home, I'm coming home.
Coming home from across the sea.
Home, I'm coming home.
No more marching and fighting for me

I am soldier,
A coming home soldier.
No purple heart
Do I wear on my chest.
I'm just a soldier,
A coming home soldier
I know that I,
I've done my best.

I'm coming home I'm coming,
I'm coming home I'm coming home.

The girl I left behind.
Has been waiting patently
She said, she didn't mind.
Cause helpin keep our land free.

I am soldier,
A coming home soldier.
No purple heart
Do I wear on my chest.
I'm just a soldier,
A coming home soldier
I know that I,
I've done my best.

I'm coming home I'm coming,
I'm coming home I'm coming home.
