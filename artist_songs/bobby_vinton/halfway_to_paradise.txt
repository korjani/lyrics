I want to be your lover 
But your friend is all I've stayed 
I'm only halfway to paradise 
So near, yet so far away 

I long for your lips to kiss my lips 
But just when I think they may 
You lead me halfway to paradise 
So near, yet so far away, mmm 

Bein' close to you is almost heaven (heaven) 
But seein' you can do just so much 
It hurts me so to know your heart's a treasure (treasure) 
And that my heart is forbidden to touch, so 

Put your sweet lips close to my lips 
And tell me that's where they're gonna stay 
Don't lead me halfway to paradise 
Mmm, so near, yet so far away 

Oh, uh, oh so near, yet so far away 
Yeah, yeah so near, yet so far away
