Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold 

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold 

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
