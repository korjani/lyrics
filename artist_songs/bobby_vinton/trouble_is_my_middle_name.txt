Hello, little girl, goodbye, little girl 
I'm not your kind of guy, little girl 
I'll only make you cry, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Each kiss, little girl, is sweet, little girl 
They sweep me off my feet, little girl 
But no more must our lips meet, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

I'm just a born wanderer driftin' by one day 
Each place that I've been, heartbreak moved in 
So I'll move on my way 

In time, little girl, you'll find, little girl 
I've been really kind, little girl 
Not changing your name to mine, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Not changing your name to mine, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Oh, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 
FADE 
Yes, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name
