My heart belongs to only you 
I've never loved as I love you 
You've set a flame within me burning 
A flame to stay within me yearning 
It's just for you I want to live 
It's just to you my heart I give 
I'll always be your slave my darling 
Through the coming years 

There were sometimes whe I was doubtful 
Of this new love affair 
But now my mind is no more doubtful 
I've found my heaven with the help of a prayer 

You are the song within my soul 
A melody that can't grow old 
I've known for long 
My heart belongs to only you 

You are the song within my soul 
A melody that can't grow old 
I've known for long 
My heart belongs to only you
