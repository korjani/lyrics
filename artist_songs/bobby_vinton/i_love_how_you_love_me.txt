I love how your eyes close
Whenever you kiss me.
And when I'm away from you
I love how you miss me. 
I love the way you always
Treat me tenderly. 
But darlin' most of all,
I love how you love me 

I love how your heart beats
Whenever I hold you.
I love how you think of me
Without being told to.
I love the way your touch
Is always heavenly. 
But darlin' most of all
I love how you love me.

I love the way your touch
Is always heavenly. 
But darlin' most of all
I love how you love me.

I love how you hug me 
I love how you squeeze me,
Tease me, please me
Love how you love me 

I love how you love me
