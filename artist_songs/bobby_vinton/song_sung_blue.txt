Song sung blue
Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one

Me and you were subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song,
You sing them out again
Sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it starts to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Me and you were subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song,
You sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it starts to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow
