All my life I've been the slave of consequence,
wondering how this life could be so intricate.
I wanna rewrite my heart and let the future in.
I wanna open it up and let somebody in.

Can you free me from the logic that I knew?
I'll believe it even if it is not true.

Am I falling asleep on my feet again? 
I call out - is anybody listening?
And it's like I'm diving into emptiness,
but at least there is something beating in my chest.

Will you free me from the logic that I knew?
I'll believe it even if it is not true.
