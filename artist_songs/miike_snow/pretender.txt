I didn’t wanna wake up
But then I felt your touch
Now I notice that I drink too much
And the turning of the universe oh

Spent the morning as a pretender
Will this be the age of surrender
The falling dark it lines
The walls let ours combine

I didn’t wanna wake up
But then I felt your touch
Now I notice that I drink too much
And the turning of the universe oh

And the children lie in their places
I can see the lines in their faces
The falling dark it lines
The walls let ours combine

I didn’t wanna wake up
But then I felt your touch
Now I notice that I drink too much
And the turning of the universe oh
