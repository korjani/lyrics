The first strike of the hammer
Made my heart beat faster
The rat-tat to remind me
That there was something behind me

You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won’t be saved
We’ll all be staring at the wave

They told me I wasn’t anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a fee for the master
I was a walking disaster

I know you hear it coming
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel it coming
Don’t let it get you down

You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won’t be saved
We’ll all be staring at the wave

But my love won’t be saved
We’ll all be staring at the wave
