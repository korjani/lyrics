The sun sets for so long on these streets
So many beautiful faces that don’t need me

Papers and little useless things
Slide down along the pavement away from me
Taking my tea in silence
Telling strange jokes to myself
God help this divorce
God help this divorce

She was a beauty queen
But I held her down, down down,
I held her down, down down.
I held her, I held her.

No, I held her down, down down,
I held her down, down down.
I held her, I held her.

Go to the bar and say semi-sexist things

Taking my tea in silence
Telling strange jokes to myself
God help this divorce
God help this divorce

She was a beauty queen
But I held her down, down down,
I held her down, down down.
I held her, I held her.

No, I held her down, down down,
I held her down, down down.
I held her, I held her.
