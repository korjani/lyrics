I'm a headless horseman on quilted sand dunes
With my neck wide open, I pray for refuge

Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages
Withering down to the champagne quicksand
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless

Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup

I'm a tritone bible with misprint logic;
I count lunar cycles with faithless prophets

Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages
Withering down to the champagne quicksand
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless

Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup

I'm a mountainless valley
Never comforted crashing
I'm just another stone on broken walls
Racing the winds in a hurricane
I'm not as brave as I once was
I've been kicking these rocks in a river
And they've been sinking low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Oh they've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
I mean, I lied, how long?
Cause they've been sinking low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Won't keep a promise I can't make
Cause I've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low

Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup

Low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
We've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
