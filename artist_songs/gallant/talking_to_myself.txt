I've been talking to myself lately
I'm asking for advice, oh
I've been slowly loosening my grip on this reality
Tongue-tied, the dominoes break
So won't you lend me your faith?

I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound, and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh

I've been whispering to ghosts lately
I'm begging for more time
Before I'm buried deeper in the trenches of insanity
Feed me a piece of my mind

I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh

How'd my own molecules forsake me?
Atoms chained behind my back
I should be bold, I should be bold in my logic and reasoning
But I just calculate my intentions
I hope that won't follow me to my old age
I'm a moss-covered stone on a foothill
And I'm tumbling, tumbling

I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
