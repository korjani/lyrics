I spend my time daydreaming, a routine void of meaning. 
You can’t slow down when you’re not moving at all. 
My feet are nailed to the floor and things have been 
the same way since I can recall. 

I waste my time and imagine that I haven’t been stuck 
for so long. I wish that I was less wrong about that. 

Why can’t I just move along like everyone around me 
seems to do, while I’m stuck here, exhausted, trying 
desperately to rupture through the cage that I feel I’m stuck in? 
I scream but no one hears my pleading cry so I’ll just fall back asleep tonight. 

I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to break these shackles off. 
And I’m not sure if I did, I’d even know which way to walk. 

My mind is growing weak and the things around all 
look the same to me.

Why can’t I just move along like everyone around me 
seems to do, while I’m stuck here, exhausted, trying 
desperately to rupture through the cage that I feel I’m stuck in? 
I scream but no one hears my pleading cry so I’ll just fall back asleep tonight.
