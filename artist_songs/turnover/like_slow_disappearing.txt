Three sixteen’s of an inch,
Disappear right behind your lips, we were
Waiting and watching the light in the sky,
And it hurt my eyes.

I guess that it must have been then,
We slipped out of our cagey heads and got
Tangled and lost and dove further out into it all again.

And I was afraid, but you were glowing like,
A most relieving light.
You were my revealing light.

I close my eyes and suddenly we were attached.
You stayed with me after the moment passed,
I felt you buried deep under my chest,
Like my lungs when I’m breathing in,
And I was not myself when I opened up my eyes again.

Over our heads in a daze,
We sat and watched while the setting changed into,
Something I read in a book that I loved when I was young

I fixed my stare to the screen,
A show with a monster was on the TV,
It was early October, and all of the yards were alive,
With lights.

And I was afraid, but you were glowing like,
A most relieving light.
You were my revealing light.

I close my eyes and suddenly we were attached.
You stayed with me after the moment passed,
I felt you buried deep under my chest,
Like my lungs when I’m breathing in,
And I was not myself when I opened up my eyes again.
