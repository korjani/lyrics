Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young.
Positively unattached, 
Naive and unattracted to the buzz.
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song.
Show me why you're always smiling.
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space.
Drawn outside the lines,
your words, a vibrant illustration you create.

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole,
Deep down into an old slope.
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go,
Spinning out of control

Oh just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.

Just take me where you go.
When it gets dark without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive.
I wanna run and hide,
With you tonight I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive.
