Come, take from me, the things that I could never 
seem to find the way to push from my mouth. 
The doubt is inescapable and all around. 
In a liar’s throne I spoke a specious truth. 
Upon my face I wore a mask crafted for you. 

Bricks and mortar built these walls 
so I could keep this hidden until now. 
The ground trembles underneath my feet 
before it all comes crashing down. 
I’m a liar and a fool. 
In my deceit I built a prison around you. 
Pray for me. 

You took from me, the things that I could never 
seem to find the way to make myself confess. 
Believe me when I say I tried my hardest.
