Your shouts are as quiet as a whisper now. 
All that’s left is this ringing in my ears. 
Nothing you could ever say is loud enough to resonate. 
This is something I call letting go. 

For all this time I spent thinking about you, 
I was better off not thinking at all. 
So goodbye, forget these words I never meant. 
I’ll get by just fine on my own. 

Between you and me, I never was the one to speak too loud. 
Things have changed now. 
Nothing that you ever said is something I remember, 
no matter how loud you screamed. 

Softly, so softly, I hear an echo fading out so far away.
