Hey!
We are Number One
Hey!...
We are Number One
Now listen closely

Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
You have to chase a superhero on the run

Just follow my moves, and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound
Shh
No, don't touch that!

We are Number One
Hey!...
We are Number One...

Ha ha ha
Now look at this net, that I just found
When I say go, be ready to throw
Go!
Throw it at him, not me!
Ugh, let's try something else

Now watch and learn, here's the deal
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel
Ha ha ha, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?

Hey!
We are Number One
Hey!...
We are Number One...
