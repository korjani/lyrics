I got no time
I got no time to live
I got no time to live, and I can't say good bye
And I'm regretting having memories
Of my friends who they used to be
Beside me before they left me to die

And I know this is
I know this is the truth
Cause I've been staring at my death so many times
These scary monsters roaming in the halls
I wish I could just block the doors
And stay in bed until the clock will chime

So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'till dawn
I got this headache and my life's on the line
I felt like I won, but I wasn't done
The nightmare repeats itself every time

Got to keep my calm, and carry on
Stay awake until the sun will shine
But I'm not so strong, and they're not gone
They're still out there to take what's left of mine

I have this urge
I have this urge to kill
I have this urge to kill and show that I'm alive
I'm getting sick from these apologies
From people with priorities
That their life matters so much more than mine

But I'm stuttering
I'm stuttering again
No one will listen and no one will understand
Because I'm crying as much as I speak
Cause no one likes me when I shriek
Want to go back to when it all began

So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'till dawn
I got this headache and my life's on the line
I felt like I won, but I wasn't done
The nightmare repeats itself every time

Got to keep my calm, and carry on
Stay awake until the sun will shine
But I'm not so strong, and they're not gone
They're still out there to take what's left of mine
