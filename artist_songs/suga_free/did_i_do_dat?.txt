[Intro]
Did I do that?
Didn't I make a way out of no way? Hmmm?

[Verse 1: Cash Flow]
Now how to shake her? Her feelings got way deep
And the only way to ease the pain was twist me
Then put me in a messed up position
Cause she knew that I was pimping
When she saw me thumbing through my chippings
I kept my foot on her neck
And at the same time, I thought I had her full respect
Suga Free can I fly?

[Suga Free:]
Yes son, if you know that pimps is born and a mack never ask why

[Cash Flow:]
Cause I need that right now
So I can reevaluate my game when I get out
I'm silky slim with the tilted brim
So if you ain't choosing, you losing
Better wake up and smell the cruising
And jump your ass in
We past then
Opportunities knocking at your door girlfriend
And guess who I see
(Who?)
Ain't that? Yeah that's the bitch I shuck in '93

[Hook: Suga Free]
Did I do that?
I just wanna know
Baby did I do that?
Tell me soooo
Did I do that?
I just wanna know
Did I do that?

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Now, didn't I do what I said I was gonna do when I got out the pen?
That must've happened, ask yo' mama, plus your family and friends
You wanna nigga you can punk and put out your house don't you?
If you could you'd get him drunk, dip in his pockets won't you?
Tell him what to do and how to do it and he do it like a punk
Laughing with her friends about the game she run
On the phone in your face with a straight face
Outta line and outta place
To her every day is Fuck This Nigga Day
She in her car crying
She don't wanna be there
Cause you a trick with an irresistible itch
She don't wanna be square
Who bought the car? I did
Who bought the house? I did
Run through payments? I did
So shut the fuck up bitch cause I'm straight getting rich
And all the disrespect baby, let me tell you something
I'm used to breaking my fingernails, it ain't nothing
Did I really pimp them hoes?
Yes I did that
And really did I...ho stroll?
Yes I did that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Res Lucca]
We grew up young together
Talk shit had fun together
And I thought it would last forever
But thangs change and I could see the change in you
And them words that you spoke to me they wasn't true
Said you had a love and claimed a nigga wasn't real
Never once hated told you do what you feel
When I slowed my role so we could go and do it right
L.A. to A.T.L. taking first class flights
Thought you was the one
The one that I could call my own
Chopping it up, conversations up on the phone
Making future plan
You my woman I'm your man
But some things just don't ride, you understand
There it is, the drama unfolded without the lust
Sparking up problems that also separated us
So what's happening with you, what's cracking with you?
I kept it all real like a man would do
Now did I do that?

[Hook]
