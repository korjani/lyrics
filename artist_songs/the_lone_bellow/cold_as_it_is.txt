Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
I wouldn't leave my baby dog, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave

I saw you walking under water,
While I was drowning underneath
I'm just like any other damned,
Pulling me into the deep

Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
I wouldn't leave my baby dog, I wouldn't leave

Your name was written on the air though
I cut my name up to that tree
You're cold, but darling it's all natural
Way you bring me to my knees!

Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
I wouldn't leave my baby dog, I wouldn't leave

Water you take me in,
Calling me instead
While I speed, wash me
Singing sorrow songs,
Lock before the dawn
Waiting for the midnight
Waiting for the midnight

Water you take me in,
Calling me instead
While I speed, wash me
Singing sorrow songs,
Lock before the dawn
Waiting for the midnight
Waiting for the midnight

Waiting...
Waiting...

Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby dog
I wouldn't leave my baby dog, I wouldn't leave
