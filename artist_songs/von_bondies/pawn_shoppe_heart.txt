I found my heart 
In a pawn shop, baby 
You took me for dead - dead 
By the way - you still 
I am way past tales 
I'm bored and I'm crazy 
You took all my good love 
And gave it all away 

I've been on the backstreet 
I'm all alone 
I've been on the hotseat 
I'm gone - I'm gone 
Sweet little love of mine 
Take all you can 
I'm your pawn shop lover 
I'm your pawn shop, broken-heart man 

With all your good looks 
I still have nothing 
Breaking the whip on my back like a man 
Still have nothing 
Take everything you want 
Take all you can 
I'm your pawn shop lover 
I'm your pawn shop, broken-heart man
