I've been hanging around this place too long 
I get satisfied and then I'm gone 
You break me down and then you treat me low 
Like a love you won't bestow 
On me [x2]

These feelings I have can't be wrong 
The signs say - 
I've got the right of way 

Self-destruction is my destination 
This is how it pains my days 
With mixed emotions - even lies 
You make me break all ties to these ways 
You lay this guilt on me 
On me [x3]

These feelings I have can't be wrong 
The signs say - 
I've got the right of way 

You take me seriously when I'm playing the part 
Oh, the man with the shattered start 
You break me down and then you treat me low 
Like the love you won't bestow 
On me [x4]

These feelings I have can't be wrong 
The signs say - 
I've got the right of way 

You've got to break it, break it to me 
You got to break it to me easy 
[repeat and fade to end]
