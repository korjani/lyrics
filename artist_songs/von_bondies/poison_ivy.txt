Nothing can compare 
Two weeks I stared 
Hands, hand tied 

I got an itch 
I call her poison ivy 
It can kill 
Hey hey, oh well 

I've got an itch 
I call her poison ivy 
It can kill 
Oh, well 

Poison ivy 
Poison ivy 
Poison - hey hey hey hey 

Took my youth 
Everything that ever meant something 
Nothing comes between me and you 
Most of my friends 
Most of my friends 
Are dead because of you 

Poison ivy 
Poison ivy 
Poison - hey hey hey hey 

I had no choice 
But to love you 
Poison ivy 
Poison ivy 
Poison ivy 
Hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey 

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
