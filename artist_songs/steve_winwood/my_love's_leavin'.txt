I can't believe she's going
I said please show me
What selfish seeds I plant along the way
Black harvest today

The empty bed she left me, cold on one side
Can't believe, only me
Shadows in purple thrill me
I cry myself awake each night
I can't believe that it's true
Here I am, where are you

Can I cope with today
My love is leavin' me
Still I'm hoping she'll stay
My love is leavin' me

But I'll control my feelings
I find faith, healing
And I'll find hope singing
The way is so long
But I'm going to be strong
Oh, what a turn around
Soon, someday I'll be bound

And I'll cope with today
My love is leavin' me
Still I'm hoping she'll stay
My love is leavin' me

Can't believe, only me
Shadows in purple thrill me
I cry myself awake each night
I can't believe that it's true
Here I am, where are you my love
Breathing your perfume chills me
Dreams never lie
Is it true, asking you
My love is leavin' me
Still I'm hoping she'll stay
My love is leavin' me
