I love the way you walk
I love the way you walk
I'm crazy 'bout your walk
I love the way you walk

You my baby... I got my eyes on you

I like the way you switch
I like the way you switch
I like the way you switch
I like the way you switch

You my baby... I got my eyes on you

You got dimples in your jaw
You got dimples in your jaw
You got dimples in your jaw
You got dimples in your jaw

You my baby I got my eyes on you
Well I see you every day
Well I see you every day
In your neighborhood
Well I see you every day
Well I see you every day

You my baby... I got my eyes on you
