Well my temperature's rising and my feet are on the floor
Twenty people knocking 'cos they're wanting some more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot

[Chorus:]
I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day

Well I feel so good, everything is sounding hot
Better take it easy 'cos the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute baby, it could happen to you

[Chorus:]
I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day

Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
Better take it easy 'cos the place is on fire
Been a hard day and nothing went too good
Now I'm gonna relax honey, everybody should

[Chorus:]
I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day

Gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin') I need it
(Gimme gimme some lovin') I need it
Ooh, gimme some lovin', every day, every day
