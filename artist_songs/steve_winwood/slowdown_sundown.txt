Sundown coming down too soon, no time to be alone
So I'll take a glass of memories and understand the blues
Oh they're the last thing you lose

Slowdown sundown, all I really need is time
For faded love songs and feelings in the wine
Let them take me down the line

Sunrise, a woman's eyes, good loving one warm afternoon
Here's to all the strong ones who don't care if they win
The kind I'll never see again

Slowdown, give me just a little while
It's not the darkness, it's just the night's so long
Puts the sadness in the song

Here's to someday when someone understands it
Why life keeps turning like a mad thing
Until that someday I'll just play what I have to play though I play it alone

Slowdown sundown, all I really need is time
For faded love songs and feelings in the wine
Let them take me down the line
