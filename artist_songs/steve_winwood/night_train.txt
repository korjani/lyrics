Out of the night burning with light
Train shining black, I won't look back, life is running
Hoping some day someone will say I got it made
Pull up the shade, let the sun in

Down on the night train, I feel the starlight steal away
Use up a lifetime looking for the break of day

Border patrol looking through me
Towns without names all look the same, I hear crying
Paris to Spain, countries in pain
Caught up in flight, feeling the sight, Europe dying

Rolling on, hear the wheels singing, fever keep coming on so strong
My ticket paid, trying to fade
I hope I get there not just somewhere I was leaving
Out in the dark all the wolves bark
I fold my arms try to keep warm by believing

Hard rain following on, cold wheels moving on
Everybody they're so alone down on the night train
