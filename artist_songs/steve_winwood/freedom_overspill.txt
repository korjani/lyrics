Keep on talking all you want
Well you don't waste a minute of time
Who cares, who knows what's true
Coffee and tears the whole night through
Burning up on midnight oil
And it's come right back on you

Freedom Overspill
Freedom Overspill

Force of habit, you could say
The way they talk you're talking away
Who cares, who knows what's true
Your wounded pride is burning you up
Burning up on midnight oil
And it's come right back on you

Freedom Overspill
Freedom Overspill

You're sounding good to me now
Keep talking on
I want to hear the worst
You got no right going around
Talking 'bout the things that you do
Talking 'bout the things that you do
Keep on talking all you want
Well you don't waste a minute of time
Who cares, who knows what's true
Coffee and tears the whole night through
Burning up on midnight oil
And it's come right back on you

Freedom Overspill

You're sounding good to me now
Keep talking on

You got no right going around
Talking 'bout the things that you do
Talking 'bout the things you do
Force of habit, you could say
The way they talk you're talking away
Who cares, who knows what's true
Your wounded pride is burning you up
Burning up on midnight oil
And it's come right back on you
