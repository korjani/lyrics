Raise the window on another day
Take it as it comes
Just an actor waiting for a new play
Take it as it comes

Ask me to dance, I will dance for you
Ask me to sing, see what I do
If you feel sad, I'll make jokes for you
I'm a handyman, I'm still coming through

If you suffer from a broken heart
Take it as it comes
If your lover tears your world all apart
Got to take it as it comes

I've played a king and a down and out fool
Some like it hot, and some like it cool
Do what they want, but don't be their tool
Savor the throne, but don't mind the stool

Carry on, carry on, carry on...

If they go too far, that's the way things are
Though it may hurt some, take it as it comes

We're all skating on the thinnest of ice
Got to take it as it comes
In a world that is not so very nice
Got to take it as it comes

And day now the curtain may fall
All the plays end, there's no curtain call
If you live sad, or it you walk tall
We're written on wind that's a lot to haul

Carry on, carry on, carry on...

If they go too far, that's the way things are
Though your mind gets numb, take it as it comes
We're all skating on the thinnest of ice
Got to take it as it comes
In a world that is not so very nice
Got to take it as it comes

Any day now the curtain may fall
All the plays end, there's no curtain call
If you live sad, or if you walk tall
We're written on wind that's a lot to haul

Carry on, carry on, carry on...

If they go too far, that's the way things are
Though your mind gets numb, take it as it comes
If they go too far, that's the way things are
If they break your thumbs, take it as it comes
