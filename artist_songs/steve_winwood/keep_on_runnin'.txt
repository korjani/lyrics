Keep on runnin'
Keep on hidin'
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be your man

Hey hey hey
Everyone is talkin' about me
Makes me feel so bad
Hey hey hey
Everyone is laughing at me
Makes me feel so sad
Keep on runnin'
Hey hey
All right!

Keep on runnin'
Runnin' from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be your man

Hey hey hey
Everyone is talkin' about me
Makes me feel so bad
Hey hey hey
Everyone is laughing at me
Makes me feel so sad
Keep on runnin'
Hey hey
All right!
