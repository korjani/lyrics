How many times must I tell you babe,
How many bridges I've got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss,
'Fore I can talk to the boss?

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I'll try to be your forever man,
Try to be your forever man.

[Repeat Second Verse]

Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Try to be your forever man.

Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Try to be your forever man.
