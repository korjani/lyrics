Had a dream last night, the angels had come riding
In the light of day where there was no more hiding
All so fine, I still see them shine
I saw angels play right in the light of day

And I watched them fly across a fiery sky
And I heard their cry as they passed me by
I could feel the light inside me, I could feel it everywhere
Life was clear and fair

Woke up in the dark and tried to keep believing
In the light I saw, in time of constant grieving
Vision fair, please don't disappear
And please hear my prayer there in the light of day

When I look within I see them shine again
As the darkness ends and the light begins
I can feel the light inside me, I can feel it everywhere
They are all still there

On the street tonight the innocent are dying
And the world's not right, so many millions crying
Evil lives and hate never gives, hell is never far
And is this all we are?

Oh, Lord, hear us cry, up in the fiery sky
That our souls may fly to you when we die
Help us feel the light inside us, help us feel it everywhere
Oh, Lord, be there
