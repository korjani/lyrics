[Chorus:]
Tell the truth. Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth. Who's been fooling who?

There you sit there, looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by.
You better come to terms with your fellow men soon, cause...

The whole world is shaking now. Can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now. Can't you see it?

[Chorus]

It doesn't matter just who you are,
Or where you're going or been.
Open your eyes and look into your heart.

The whole world is shaking now. Can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now. Can't you see it?
I said see it, yeah, can't you see it?
Can't you see it, yeah, can't you see it?
I can see it, yeah.

[Chorus]

Hear what I say, 'cause every word is true.
You know I wouldn't tell you no lies.
Your time's coming, gonna be soon, boy.

[Repeat Second Bridge 2x]
