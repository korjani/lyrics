Close your eyes and you'll do very well
No more lies and no more fairy tales
Hanging out, out on the street
You have no place left to go
If the whole world passes you by
Don't you cry

Close your eyes and don't feel anything
Lullabies are all that I will sing
Stay right here, wait for the night
Let it come down over you
You've seen all you wanted to see
Stay with me

[Chorus:]
When there's no more right from wrong
You still have the night so long
And the silence is your song
And you know where you belong

Close your eyes, the white owl's on the wing
Hear her cries, and take the sleep she brings
When the clouds fill up the sky
And the shadows hide the moon
Sleep will give you all that is left -
Emptiness

[Chorus 3x]
