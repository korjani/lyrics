When the night comes rollin' and the day is through
Then I come strollin' down that avenue
Baby, I got what no one can give you - all my lovin'
All the guys wanna get down with you
But there ain't no one that's got my rhythm

'Cause I'm the lord of the street, no one can compete with my love for you
Said I'm the lord of the street, you got the kinda heat brings me close to you

Oh, I can't get enough of it, let me dance for you
When I start movin' you'll be dancing too
You and I gonna rock together, our hearts are burning
We'll take on all kinds of weather
Girl, this night's gonna last forever

The power to love someone up above is good to me
He's got the kinda love the helps me to see
