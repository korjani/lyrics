Following the shadows of the skies or are they only figments of my eyes?
And I'm feeling close to where the race is run
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy

Once the door swings open into space and I'm already waiting in disguise
Or is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy
Having trouble coming through, through this concrete, blocks my view
And it's all because of you

Or is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy
