You used to come and see me all the time
I gave you everything I had
I brought you up
And I never left you one time feeling bad
They say it's a new age
And I wonder where you've been
You can help me turn a new page
The same door is open-come on in

While there's a candle burning
I'll be reaching for your heart
While there's a wheel still turning
I know how to play my part
So I keep the wheels all turning
And I keep the candles burning
All day through here for you

The world is full of players in the night
They say the words they have to say
They're all so hot
And they never give a damn for yesterday
Don't care if they touch you
Everywhere you saved for me
'Cause I still know how to move you
I still know how to rock you-come and see
