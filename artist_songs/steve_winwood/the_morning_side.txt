You meet every kind of person moving toward the morning side
You see the good and the bad, the eyes are sad
You play every midnight gambler before you see the light
On the morning side, the morning side

You feel every heat and passion moving towards the morning side

To earn one more second chance, you learn the dance
When you finally climb the mountain, you see the other side
It's the morning side, the morning side

Now my life has changed and now my eyes can see
Now I'm living on the morning side
Now I'm letting all the sunlight into me
Now I'm free

And I know I'll never pass that way again
That dark journey to the morning side
On the morning side I feel my life begin
Let's begin
