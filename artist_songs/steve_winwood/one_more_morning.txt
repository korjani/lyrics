In the sky, light is coming, so glad we all have this day
We all want one more morning just to know the night won't stay
Lift my eyes to the dawning to see the life start again
Just to see one more morning, just to feel it all begin
Just to have this day and life starting all over, for all it may bring

A blessing on everything and one more song I can sing

One more day, one more memory, one more link in the chain
We all want one more morning just to feel it all again
Just to have this day and life starting all over, for all it may bring

A blessing on everything and one more song I can sing
In the arms we were born in, in the arms that will take us home
We all want one more morning, then we'll take the night to come
