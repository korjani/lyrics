Oh baby I had to think things through
I never needed love when I was all by myself
Now comes the time I know it's gotta be you
Oh baby, now I need your help

Ooh come on now baby
I wanna give some special time to you now
Cos ooh, when you touch me
Got a feelin' I can't hide

Now I know all I need is you
You're my reason for stayin' alive
I know that it's real, I feel it inside
Come on now, let's not wait

Gimme plenty lovin', Gimme plenty lovin'
Gimme plenty lovin', every day, every night, come on, baby

Oh baby, you know we'll be apart
We gotta make up on love till I'll be with you again
Thinking of you, the feeling in my heart
Let's start doin' what we do till then
Ooh, I'm hearin' what you say
We gotta make the most of it for us now, baby
Now we're together, I'll be holding you tonight

Just can't stay any longer
You're my only true soul mate
The day's almost gone, but night is still ahead
Come on now, don't hesitate
