Help me angel
Plant my feet a little higher
Help me angel
I've been too close to the fire
Help me angel
Make my dream a little brighter
Help me angel
Help me turn on all the lights

You've seen all the sights
You've lived through all the nights
You've got something I have to know
'Cause I've still got far to go

Help me angel
'Cause it's so dark everywhere
Help me angel
Find the magic in the air

When sun's going down
And light leaving town
Something's shining deep in your eyes
Sunday morning, endless sunrise

You've got what I have to find
In the sunshine in your mind
