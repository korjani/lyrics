Strong love is what you've got
And I can't get no sleep
Strong love is what you've got
And I can't find no key
I can hardly sleep at night
It makes me toss and turn
It's a fire in my heart
And I just let it burn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Strong love is what you've got
And I can hardly eat
Strong love is what you've got
And there is no retreat
I try to swallow, baby
It just won't go down
Got my head a spinnin', darlin'
It's goin' round and round
Goin' round.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know your love is real
Show me how you feel
Oh yeah, Oh yeah

Strong love is what you've got
And I can't get no sleep
Strong love is what you've got
And I can't find no key
I can hardly sleep at night
It makes me toss and turn
It's a fire in my heart
And I'm gonna let it burn
Let it burn
