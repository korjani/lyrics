Ooo Oooh Ooo
Ooo Oooh
Ooo Oooh Oooh

Lately in my room
Steady thanking about chu
And all the good times that we've had
And all the times you made me laugh

Where did it all go?
Why am I here all alone?
This ain't my life and the way this Posed to be
It's supposed to beee... yooou... here with me

[Chorus:]
Take all my money
Take all my clothes
Take every beatin of my soul
I don't need it
Tell me what I've got
What I had I already lost

Take my house
Take my cars
Cause' I can't live without my heart
I'm down on my knees
And I'm letting go
I'm begging you to come home

I know I've hurt you in the past
I know I've made you sad
But what more can I do
To show you everythang I say is true

So many sleepless nights
So many crying nights
I just want you to see
Just how much you mean to me

[Chorus:]
Take all my money
Take all my clothes
Take every beatin of my soul
I don't need it
Tell me what I've got
What I had I already lost

Take my house
Take my cars
Cause' I can't live without my heart
I'm down on my knees
And I'm letting go
I'm begging you to come home

[Hook:]
I can't stand to see us this way
(I can't stand to see us this way)
And I can't stand to wake each morning
And not see your face

No matter what
I'm willing to pay the price
Just to have him,
Just to have him in my life

[Chorus:]
Take all my money
Take all my clothes
Take every beatin of my soul
I don't need it
Tell me what I've got
What I had I already lost

Take my house
Take my cars
Cause' I can't live without my heart
I'm down on my knees
And I'm letting go
I'm begging you to come home

(Come Home...)
4... 3... 2(2)... 1

[Spoken:]
I can't take this holding back
I can tell you this is bad
I love you and I need you
And it hurts when I can't see
Miss that feeling in my gut
When we kiss and when we hug
No more dreaming of our love
Reminiescing ain't enuff

You ain't holding me now
And consolding me now
I'm in this lonely house
Feeling lonely now
Take the money take the keys
Take the clothes take it all
Cause' without his love I continue to grow

[Chorus:]
Take all my money
Take all my clothes
Take every beatin of my soul
I don't need it
Tell me what I've got
What I had I already lost

Take my house
Take my cars
Cause' I can't live without my heart
I'm down on my knees
And I'm letting go
I'm begging you to come home
