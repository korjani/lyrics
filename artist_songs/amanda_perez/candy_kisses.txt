(I've got them candy kisses on my mind..)

[Verse 1:]
I never met nobody like you. (like you)
That'll do all the things that you do.
(that you do)
Every night when I go to sleep,
make my heart skip a beat.
By the way that you kiss me.
And Ooh, Now I see.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Me with you.
You with me.
I don't ever want you to leave,
'cause you give me.

[Chorus:]
Candy kisses all over me.
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in a candy store,
always want to come back for more.
'cause hes my, now and later on a rainy day,
always seem to take my stress away.
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl.
We got the sweetest love in the whole
wide world.

[Verse 2:]
Take me away.
To another day where I can hear him say,
Girl I can't be without you,
no I can't be without you.
Don't ever want to think about you loving
no one else but me.
And Ooh, Now I see.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Me with you.
You with me.
I don't ever want you to leave,
'cause you give me.

[Chorus:]
Candy kisses all over me.
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store,
always want to come back for more.
'cause he's my, now and later on a rainy day,
always seem to take my stress away.
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl.
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide
world.

[Bridge:]
Day dreaming all the time,
Candy kisses on my mind.
(Candy kisses, candy kisses, on my mind, on my mind)
Day dreaming all the time,
Candy kisses on my mind.

And Ooh, Now I see.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Me with you.
You with me.
I don't ever want you to leave,
'cause you give me.

[Chorus:]
Candy kisses all over me.
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store,
always want to come back for more.
'cause he's my, now and later on a rainy day,
always seem to take my stress away.
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl.
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide world.
