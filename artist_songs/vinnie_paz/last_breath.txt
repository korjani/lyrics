[Whispers:]
I'm living on my last breath
Hit a fork in the road and the devil occupies both lanes
Stumble as a back step
Feel the pressure on my soul as the air's leaving out my frame
Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I'm living on my last breath it's all final when it's final
When you fade into a blacked out dream

[Chris Rivers:]
Until my last breath I hope my heart's been fully accessed
Past this and my regrets I hope you're all in past tense
Marry a girl with accents carry this world's axis
Make some major changes and some statements til I'm ashes
And placed in hourglasses
So you can turn me upside down and watch as time passes
Drugs are bad habits before I'm in that casket
And the happiness I'm searching for I hope I grasp it
And hope I fully grab it and never take for granted
All the luxuries in life and still believe in magic
Look back at all my fans and know I made them track hits
And I hope I never look for love, I hope that it just happens
And if I have kids, I hope that it was stressful
But worth it in the end because they all became successful
And I hope my last breath was something truly breathful
But worse I couldn't say much more before I died and left you

[Whispers:]
I'm living on my last breath
Hit a fork in the road and the devil occupies both lanes
Stumble as a back step
Feel the pressure on my soul as the air's leaving out my frame
Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I'm living on my last breath it's all final when it's final
When you fade into a blacked out dream

[Vinnie Paz:]
Until my last breath, I'll have death before dishonor
I welcome drama with open arms and holdin' a lama
My whole persona is vodka bottles and marijuana
The hope in Nana was rockin', inspired from my Mama
I'm a warrior, I went into jail for the drama
I'm the story of the terrorist cell of Osama
I wanna never have birth and fail as a father
I would never want the illness that killed in my Nana
The half moon on the bank of the river's devotion
That's the stab wound, born from the killer emotion
I was enraged by darkness, militant motion
I was embraced by the thought of distilling the ocean
I would never question the power of God pain
Until I saw his body the color of dark rain
He recited the third chapter, Allah name
And he ignited the third chapter, Allah flame

[Whispers:]
I'm living on my last breath
Hit a fork in the road and the devil occupies both lanes
Stumble as a back step
Feel the pressure on my soul as the air's leaving out my frame
Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I'm living on my last breath it's all final when it's final
When you fade into a blacked out dream
