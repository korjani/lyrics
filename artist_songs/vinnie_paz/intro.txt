[Dialogue:]
He's a fighter, and fighter
You don't make fighters
Vinnie's a born fighter
And I could see that
That this kid when he was little
He was different from other kids

YEAH! PAZIENZA!
I'm HERE BABY!
The way of the assassin is found in death
Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day when one's body and mind are at peace
One should meditate on being ripped apart by arrows
Rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown into the midst of a great fire
Being struck by lightning
Being shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs
Dying of disease or committing seppuku
At the death of one's master
And every day without fail
One should consider himself as dead
This is the substance and the way of the assassin
