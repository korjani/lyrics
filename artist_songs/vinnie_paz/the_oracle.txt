[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
What I’mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck

I’m a bull in a china shop, watch how the uzi spit
Who we with, bros with hammers and they like too legit
I ain’t got any time for your foolishness
Raw raps from the same place where the Kufi sits
He the mo’fucker always sippin’ goose and shit
Stomp a rapper out, Timberland boots and shit
The left hand is what I give you the contusions with
The right hand is where I write all of the ruthless shit
Survival of the fit on my Lil' Boosie shit
My hands are made of stone cut from that Medusa shit
Big gold chains, we was on that dookie shit
Still run with the kids I stole the Gucci with
I punch you dead in the face so fuck the music shit
The guns Commando, Hollywood movie shit
Y'all are weird, y'all on that Lollapalooza shit
Let the beard grow Alhamdulelah, Sofi shit
Y’all are scared when I step inside the booth and shit
Cuttin’ mo’fuckers cell roll on some sushi shit
Y’all are cowards, y’all only talk on computer shit
This a Haitian ritual, I’m on my Voodoo shit

Find out who’s the realest (Vinnie)
Rock it not quick
What I’mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck

Death before dishonor, tiger blood y’all are fake
I let the 4.5 blocka blocka rob his cake
Dead Sea overlook the view from inside a grave
The dictionary definition of dominate
Ya'll weed Germantown brown lord, lots of shake,
Fat bull, but my pockets never out of shape
You a bitch, security guards lock the gates
The Louis Vuitton bootleg, Prada fake
I’m tryin’ to make the same money that Madonna make
Eyes never lie, I’m surprised that you not with Jake
Rhymes in one take, record an album in an hour straight
You a pile of waste, I see a sucker and salivate
Cutting motherfuckers off, time to consolidate
A thousand pounds of weight’ll force your heart to palpitate
It’s Armageddon for you motherfuckers, lock the date
Any bitch I meet means that I’mma copulate
My revolution will be met with Peter Tosh’s fate
That’s the reason that the God is tryin’ to populate
A connoisseur, I can tell you how the vodka taste
The 4.5 lift you, send you into outer space
