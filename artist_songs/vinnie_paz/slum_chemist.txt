I know how people fucking think out there, and fuck, it's gotta be that way. They've gotta tell you that 'Thou shall not kill' shit and all of that. But that's not the way the world works, Selby. Cuz I'm out there every fucking day living it. Who the fuck knows what God wants?

We can be as different as we wanna be, but you can't kill people!

SAYS WHO?

HAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA

The God Of The Serengeti
The lion king

I like that y'all consider me the bad guy
Big guns everywhere, bullets g'wan pass by
My blood’s g-code, never seen my dad cry
And I'ma bleed your block till the cash dry
You live in fucking Babylon and ask why
Your arms to short to box God, that's why
So watch a big mouth turn into a cracked eye
Watch a big house turned into a smashed sty
Send them to the Devil, let his ass fry
Heavy metal on another level, that's high
I Self Lord and Master from past tribe
I let my young boy trash you from bad vibes
Reincarnated rat from a past life
I drink a 40 of idiot then I grab Syze
For every hundred burners copped, Vinnie stash five
You asking for forgiveness? You should ask God

It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard
It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god
It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster
It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba

This is 45-caliber flow
Pound my chest like a gorilla so all the other savages know
I'm ravenous though, Jack you with the ratchet for dough
Marques de sade a painful sadomasochist flow
We tapping your ho and keep the biscuit where I piss at
Pussy boy bitches asking where this faggot dick at
I ain't never left the fucking crib without the gizzat
Ain't nobody above a homicide or a kidnap
If you got the army gear then you need the boots
If you talking about an army then you need the troops
It's all war over here I never seen the truce
I'm calling Maserati Mazi I don't mean the coupe
This here? This the duffle that I carry bones
Pistolvania most underrated since Larry Holmes
I run with a bunch of Ricans and they carry chrome
Here's a body bag to put the pussy that you carry home

It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard
It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god
It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster
It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba
It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard
It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god
It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster
It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba
