The world would not be the same
Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent
Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds

[G-Mo Skee:]
You wonder why innocent people die on random occasions
Don't fuck with me, I'll throw a tantrum and spray shit
I'm finna go apeshit
Fuck mass-murder I need a device I can erase the human race with
I'm so cold, when I walk past they stare and shiver
I'm so deadly I can make the Sierra wither
I'm so pissed I can run in the planned parent center
And slaughter everything moving with a pair of scissors
Yeah I see you in the gates of hell, stupid bitch
I hate you and I hate the smell of human scent
I wasn't always a crazy-ass lunatic
I used to love the human race, but one human ruined it
God, if you do exist then send a sign then
Darkness falls and I don't know where my mind is
I wish the world would have ended on December 21st 2012
And it hurts because mine's dead

Welcome to my innermost hate [x3]
There's no turning back once you enter those gates, nigga
Welcome to my innermost hate [x3]
There's no turning back once you enter those gates, man

[G-Mo Skee:]
Vinnie told me it's always darkness before the dawn
I'm a king you're plain garbage, you're just a pawn
Come home to a slain carcass upon your lawn
Put your house in a flame carnage, the war is on
It's an uphill battle with steep challenges
I see the destination, demons keep surrounding it
Like sleep paralysis
A thousand arms reaching for me from under my bed
Covered in green calluses
Got me ready to make a mess with your intestines
I'm looking to the mirror, I'm accepting the reflections
It's telling me that I should put deception into question
And kill people just to send a message to the heavens
I'm stepping to the reverend with a weapon in possession
I'm begging for a blessing but I'm guessing I'm neglected
Tears in my eyes but I'm heading for the exit
With my head held high, leaving motherfuckers headless

[Vinnie Paz:]
Listen batty boy, y'all should go elsewhere
I'm having problems dealing with my fucking self here
I have emotional problems and no healthcare
That means that being in my head is fucking hell here
I ain't feeling nothing and I'm on my twelfth beer
And I don't give a motherfuck about my welfare
Old age? I don't think I see myself there
And I won't be around to see my son's twelfth year
Cause I ain't stick around to see the fall
To see the end of piety and irony involved
To see the science of it all
To see that there was hell and not the heavens that provided me with y'all
Listen, I ain't even try to see tomorrow
Cause I ain't got the energy or fight to bein' y'all
I don't have desire or the drive to bein' y'all
Acknowledge that I'm probably never finding mi amour [?]

Welcome to my innermost hate [x3]
There's no turning back once you enter those gates, nigga
Welcome to my innermost hate [x3]
There's no turning back once you enter those gates, man
