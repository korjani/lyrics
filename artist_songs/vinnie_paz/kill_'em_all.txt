- People want to think that this is the Wild West – we don’t have any laws. What we don’t have is enforcement of those laws

- Senator Fumo argues tougher gun laws alone won’t stop shootings

- Last time I checked we had a law against murder. It doesn’t prevent people from killing people

- The governor, the mayor, the DA, they all want stricter gun laws

Man, fuck all that bullshit! Vinnie Paz, what up? Broad Street Bully in the building. I say kill them all! Exterminate these roaches! Fuck that! You pay me or pay Carto! Pay Pells or somebody. Hawkins or somebody. Pay me or pay the funeral home, nigger! Kill all y'all niggers! What!

[Beanie Sigel:]
May death come to all those who cross us
The preachers, the pastors, the deacons, coffins
Church masses, closed caskets, Bible verses, long black hearses
Long-ass gats too big for holsters. Obituary posters is getting posted
The reaper closing in. He’s getting closer
You just fake. You blink it’s over
State prop soldier here. SK shoulder gear
Ice grill who? Hold that stare…
Half a clip. Now hold that there
Throw out your hip. Now roll that chair, yeah
You missed the list of the souls I spare
I double-checked that you ain’t on that there
I squeeze weapons. Hollow points open up like the cobra head
Collapse lungs like a fold-up chair. Flat line! Clear

Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all

Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all

I rhyme like my life on the line. This fucking mic is mine
The past burglar, the mass murderer, the viper’s shrine
A strong body could never conquer a righteous mind
Some think it’s destiny. Some of you think it’s Christ-designed
You consider what I’m doing like a magical art
I consider what I’m doing like a stab through the heart
My brain moves at light speed. Nothing fast as my thought
You might feel a slight breeze from the savage’s heart
Y’all saying Vinnie is back but Vinnie never left
I just had these faggots hating and watching my every step
Everything with Vinnie very deadly, every breath
Everything with Vinnie very heavy, heavenly flesh
Y’all ain’t fucking with weight. I’m doing steady reps
I’mma sell my shit and then skate like I was Kerry Getz
I keep my biscuit right next to where my machete rest
Everything is everything but pussy death is death

Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all

Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all
Kill ‘em all, kill ‘em all

Beez, what up, cuzo? State Prop! Broad Street Bullies! Vinnie Paz, Vin Laden! Official Pistol Gang! Ab Liva, what up, cuzo? D-Boys, reup gang!
