My time is empty
And I want, I want to break free
Their minds, your minds are always closed
But your mouths, your mouths are always open

You see, you can see, you see the numbers
You see, you can see, you see the numbers
You see, you can see, you see the numbers
You see, you can see, you see the numbers

Where I'm from
Is not who, who I am
But now I'm facing some questions
And they're not, not quite what I want

You know the numbers
Show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers
Show, show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers
Show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers

Welcome to the north
Welcome to the north
Welcome to the north
Oh welcome to the north

You know the numbers
Show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers
Show, show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers
Show me the knuckles baby
You know the numbers

Welcome to the north
Welcome to the north
Welcome to the north
Oh welcome to the north

I don't want this
When I come home
It's where I'm from
Yeah it's where I'm from
Yeah it's where I was born
Yeah it's where I'm from

You see, you see the numbers
You see, you see the numbers
You see, you see the numbers
