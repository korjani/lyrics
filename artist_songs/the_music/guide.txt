I was coming down
From what I don't know
The life inside of me
In time will set us free
But will ya w ait wait wait for me
Will ya wait wait wait for me
Until the night is coming down
Will ya wait wait wait for me
And well
I love this mess
It makes me feel
Throughout my life
You are my guide

Today what a day
To go out sit and pray
Well will ya wait wait wait for me
Will ya wait wait wait for me
Until the night is coming down
Will ya wait wait wait for me
And well
I love this mess
It makes me feel
Throughout my life
You are my guide

Love path the way
Love path the way
And well
I love this mess
It makes me feel
Throughout my life
You are my guide

Wait wait wait for me
Will ya wait wait
