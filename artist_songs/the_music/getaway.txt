What's it like up there 
Do you worry anymore 
How's it feel up there 
So much left to say 
If i could tell your thoughts right now 
It would never be the same 
Wait til i am by your side 
Then the meaning wil come true 

You're love will find a betterway 
Everybody wants you to know 
You're love will find a betterway 
Everybody,everybody wants to know 
You're love will find a betterway 
Everybody wants you to know 
You're love will find a betterway 
Everybody,everybody wants to know 

We are nearly there 
Do you get to see the love 
Can you understand my thoughts 
Seeing as no-one else here can 
When you see the light 
Does your pain just disappear 
Will i ever feel your love 
Once again my dear 

You're love will find a betterway 
Everybody wants you to know
