She stands alone
All in a crowd
Is it her fault that
She waits to see
What's happening?
Is it safe and sound?

She says, free me from this enemy
She's waiting to be set free
Free me from this enemy
She's crying to be set free

She takes so long
But it feels so right 
To be all alone
She takes so long
But it feels so right
To be all alone

She stands alone
All in a crowd
Is it her fault that

She waits to see,
What's happening?
Is it safe and sound?

She says, free me from this enemy,
She's crying to be set free.
Free me from this enemy,
She's crying to be set free.

She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone.
She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone.
She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone.
