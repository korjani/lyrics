Some call me crazy, I might be insane
If you can't handle, get out of my way
Don't know what's wrong but I feel okay
I can't see heaven 'cause it's too far away

But I kill my blessings every time I pray
I don't make excuses when I lose my way
Baby come and give me some

I just can't control myself
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun
Like a loaded gun
I just can't control myself
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun
Like a loaded gun
Watch out I'm a loaded gun
Like a loaded, loaded
Watch out I'm a loaded gun

You're burning rubber and I'm drinking Jack
What a disaster, there's no turning back
People look down but I'm looking up
It's my religion and I don't give a fuck

But I kill my blessings every time I pray
I don't make excuses when I lose my way
Baby come and give me some

I just can't control myself
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun
Like a loaded gun
I just can't control myself
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun
Like a loaded gun
Watch out I'm a loaded gun
Like a loaded, loaded
Watch out I'm a loaded gun

When the smoke clears and it's you and I, oh, oh, oh
We can battle 'til end of time, oh, oh, oh
I just can't control myself, yeah
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun

I just can't control myself
I'm all fired up, I'm all fired up
Touch me right, I will go off like a loaded gun
Like a loaded gun
Watch out I'm a loaded gun
Like a loaded, loaded
Watch out I'm a loaded gun
