[Verse 1]
I was a fool to let you go
Let you walk right out my door
It was a bad mistake I made
And i regret it to this day
If I had a second chance
Girl i promise I'd make it last
So tonight I erase my pride
If you let me back inside

[Chorus]

Baby come back
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse2]

Over and over I try to forget you
But it seems too hard
My feelings for you I can't disregard
You're not my baby anymore baby
All I want is to bring your love back baby
It's not about sex baby
You're the best lady
Please have baby
Forever my lady

[Repeat chorus until end]
