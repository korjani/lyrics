Oh...oh...oh...oh...
Yee...eee...

I can’t believe it’s true
I’m standin’ here in front of you
And you are here with me
So unbelievable
I’d never ever let you go
My heart is yours for keeps

Let’s make a vow (Let’s make a vow, baby)
Right here and now (Here and now)

This is the day that I prayed for
And you are the girl of my dreams
And my place in life is right here by your side
On this day (On this day)
This very moment (This very moment, oh)

Today it’s you and I
We celebrate a brand new life
That God has given us
Until the end of time
I’ll hold your precious hand in mine
A promise you can treasure

We said the words (We said the words, “I do”), “I do”
Forever all my love for you {Oh...} (For you)

This is the day that I prayed for {I prayed for}
And you are the girl of my dreams {You are the girl of my dreams}
And my place in life {Ooh...} is right here by your side
On this day {From this day, yeah...}

My heart and soul will beat
This day was meant to be {Oh...oh...oh...}
I need you desperately
Through all eternity (Through all eternity)

So perfect and (Oh) so right (So right)
I vow to share my life
I’ll be here by (By) your side
From now on
This is the day that I prayed for (This is the day)
And you are the girl of my dreams (You’re the girl of my dreams)
And my place in life {Yeah, yeah, yeah} is right here by your side {By your side}
On this day {On this day}
This very moment {This very moment} (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)
This very moment (Very moment)
This very moment

I can’t believe it’s true
I’m standin’ here in front of you
And you are here with me
This very moment
