Ah, yeah, ah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah

I get so emotional
Whenever I touch you, whenever we kiss
I get so emotional
You're so beautiful, yeah

You do to many, whatever it is you do to me
You make the whole world stop
And stand still, and stand still
Now every time I see you walking by
I can see the reason why you're special to me
I thank God every day
Every time I see your pretty face

I get so emotional
Whenever I touch you, whenever we kiss
Girl, it's so physical
Whenever you're around, I can't resist

It's so sexual
Whenever you do that thing with your lips
I get so emotional

Champagne and cherries, acoustic serenades

To my life this is what you bring
Nights of passion, days of joy
