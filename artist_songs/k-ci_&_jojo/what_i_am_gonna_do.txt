We fell in love a year ago 
Everything was fine 
And then you started hangin' out late 
All the time, all the time 

I had to eat all alone 
I had to sleep all alone 
I had no one to call my own 
'Till I fell in love with someone new 

If you love me, and I love you, baby why 
(You've been duckin' me) 
Late at night when it gets cold 
I have no one to hold 
(I have no one to hold 
I have no one to hold me) 

If I love you, and you love me, baby why 
(Why do I have somebody new?) 
Now I got two, what am I, what am I gonna do? 

Tell me 
What am I gonna do, baby

I ran into you the other day 
Everything was fine (Everything was fine) 
Until I saw you hangin' out 
With another guy, with another guy

That's why I found someone else 
You tryin' to play me, but I guess 
I guess you seen that I wasn't goin' for that
