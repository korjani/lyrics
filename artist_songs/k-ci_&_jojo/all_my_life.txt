I will never find another lover sweeter than you,
Sweeter than you 
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you 
Girl you are close to me you're like my mother, 
Close to me you're like my father, 
Close to me you're like my sister, 
Close to me you're like my brother 
You are the only one my everything and for you this song I sing 

And all my life I've prayed for someone like you 
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you 
All my life I've prayed for someone like you 
And I hope that you feel the same way too 
Yes, I pray that you do love me too 

I said you're all that I'm thinking of.....baby 

Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger, 
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above, 
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug, 
I really love you 

And all my life, baby, baby, I've prayed for someone like you, 
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you, baby 
All my life I've prayed for someone like you 
And I hope that you feel the same way too 
Yes, I pray that you do, love me 

You're all that I ever known, when you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow.
You turned my life around, you picked me up when I was down, 
You're all that I ever known, when you smile on your face all I see is a glow,
You picked me up when I was down 
You're all that I ever known, when you smile on your face all I see is a glow,
You picked me up when I was down and I hope that you feel the same way too, 
Yes I pray that you do love me too 

All my life, I've prayed for someone like you, 
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you 
All my life I've prayed for someone like you 
Yes, I pray that you do love me too 
All my life I've prayed for someone like you 
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you 
All my life I've prayed for someone like you 
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
