If I had been there to wipe your tears 
then no one else would be around 
If I had been there to cradle your fears 
We'd still be together now 

Wish I could be there to share your dreams 
I wish that I could still be down, baby 
But you are gone and I'm here alone 
And I sure do regret it now 
Oh yes I do 
Said I really do 
Oh I'm missin' you 
Oh I'm missin' you 

Baby I, should've known 
I should've cared just a little bit more 
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellaz 
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go 
Baby I, and i want you to know 
If I could take it back you that I would 
I'd give anything to get things back 
Now that I know 
All the things I should've known 

Should've been there with my baby every night 
Been kissin' you and holding you so tight 
How I wish that I could be with you right now 
I'd give anything to see your smile 
But I'm all alone and all the should'ves in the world 
They won't bring you back and I'm the one to blame 
I didn't know how to act or save the love 
And I sure do regret it Lady, lady lady lady 

Baby I, should've known 
I should've cared just a little bit more 
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellaz 
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go 
Baby I, and I want you to know 
If I could take it back you that I would 
I'd give anything to get things back 
Now that I know 
All the things I should've known 

I promise I won't ignore you 
Never ever ever be alone 
Just lean on me and my shoulder 
Girl I promise u, I won't let you fall 
Yes I do 
I'm missin' you 
I'm missin' you 

Baby I, should've known 
I should've cared just a little bit more 
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellaz 
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go 
Baby I, and i want you to know 
If I could take it back you that I would 
I'd give anything to get things back 
Now that I know 
All the things I should've known
