Tell me he didn't break your heart 
Tell me he didn't lie to you 
Tell me there's no way that he set you up 
Tell me there's no way that you'll let him use you 
You'd think by now you'd know him by all his signs 
So how could you be a fool? 

[1] - Girl, here he comes again 
Tellin' lies to you 
Girl, here he comes again 
To break your heart 
You'll find out, you know he's no good 
When will you learn 
He's nothing but a user 

It's not my place to say what to do, no 
But I just can't stand when love abuses you 
He's never gonna change, no no no 
He enjoys seeing you in so much pain 
So little girl, get up off your face 
And hold your head up high 
And tell him that you are through 

[Repeat 1] 

Girl, I know you want me 
I see the look in your eyes 
All you have to do is ask me 
Don't think you're wasting your time 
I am yours if you want me 
All you have to do is tell me 
Do you want me? Do you want him? 
Look behind your back, he's comin' again 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
