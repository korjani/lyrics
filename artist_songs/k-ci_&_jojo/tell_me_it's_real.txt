[Chorus:] 
Tell me it's real 
The feeling that we feel 
Tell me that it's real 
Don't let love come 
Just to pass us by 
Try, is all we have to do 
It's up to me and you 
To make this special love 
Last forever more 

Baby you told me that you love me and you'd never leave my side 
Through the bitter end through the thick and thin 
You promised me baby that you wasn't going anywhere, yes you did 
Baby keep it real let me know just how you feel 

[Repeat Chorus]

I can't explain the way you make me feel 
Everytime you tell me that you love me 
And you know you did so many times 
Just when i thought that love could never be a part of me 
That's when you came along 
And showed me happiness 
Baby you are the best 
I think you're different from the rest 
I really love you 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Tell me it's real 
This feeling that I fell 
Tell me it's real 
For your love 
I will do anything 

[Repeat Chorus w/ ad lib]
