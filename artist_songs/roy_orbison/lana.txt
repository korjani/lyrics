Oh, beautiful Lana
I told it my mama 
And my dad        
What I had 
Was the sweetest 
And the neatest 
Little girl 
In the world

Oh La-La-La-La Lana
La-La-La-La Lana
Hey Hey Lana
He- He- hey

O- Oh Lana
Don't make me blue
O- Oh Lana
Don't you know 
Don't you know
I love you

Oh beautiful Lana
Don't you know that I wanna
Hug and kiss you 
Let you know that I miss you
While we're apart

Oh my heart
All it can say is
