Most women want to chain you to promises and such 
They take a little freedom each time they let ya touch 
She didn't try to chain me that's why I turned around 
She let me taste my freedom and now I'm homeward bound 

You know I'm headin' on back to her I'm hearing her call 
The strongest chain in the world is no chain at all at all 
That's why I'm headin' on back to her she won't let me crawl 
The strongest chain in the world is no chain at all. 

At least one pretty woman in every sleepy town 
Would bargain with her lovin and try to tie me down 
I took what I was offered like most men probably would 
But teasin' in my memory was something twice as good 

You know I'm headin' on back to her I'm hearing her call 
The strongest chain in the world is no chain at all at all 
That's why I'm headin' on back to her she won't let me crawl 
The strongest chain in the world is no chain at all at all 

That's why I'm headin' on back to her, 
Headin' on back to her, 
Headin' on back to her, lovin my baby, 
Headin' on back to her
