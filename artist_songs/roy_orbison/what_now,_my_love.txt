What now, my love, now that you've left me 
How can I live through another day 
Watching my dreams turning to ashes 
And my hopes into bits of clay 

Once I could see, once I could feel 
Now I am numb, I've become unreal 
I walk the night without a goal 
Stripped of my heart, my soul 

What now, my love, now that it's over 
I feel the world closing in on me 
Here come the stars tumbling around me 
There's the sky where the sea should be 

What now, my love, now that you've gone 
I'd be a fool to go on and on 
No one would care, no one would cry 
If I should live or die 

What now, my love, now there is nothing 
Only my last goodbye
