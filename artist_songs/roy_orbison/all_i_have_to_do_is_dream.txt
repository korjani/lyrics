When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you all I have to do
Is dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lip of wine
Any time night or day
Only trouble is gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream

Dream, dream
Dream, dream
