Hometown sweetheart, hung around in the dark. 
Only make a move or two, I was just a young fool. 
Never been to night school, didn't know enough to be cool. 

So she found another lover, they went undercover. 
The way she stole my heart was a crime 
In order to keep the peace callin' out the police 
Find her 'fore I lose my mind. 

The woman I love done gone and left me, no. 
She's got a bad big record on the Heartbreak radio. 

A complete investigation, what's her destination. 
Did she leave a trace at all? 
Book on her suspicion, just look at my condition. 
She left me here to take the fall. 

That girl she sure can play it rough, she oughta be in handcuffs. 
Make her wear a ball'n chain, oh, she's just a heart stealer. 
Sweetest kind'a love dealer, she knows how to flix a game. 

The woman I love done gone and Left me, no. 
She got a big bad record on the Heartbreak radio. 

Lonely hearts in distress, calling out an SOS. 
All across the U.S of A, come on back and serve your time. 
Right here in these arms of mine, Gotta have you home today. 
FBI, CID, help me, help me, help me please. 

The one I love has gone and left me alone. 
She got a bad big record on the heartbreak radio. 
The one I love has gone and left me alone. 
She got a bad big record on the heartbreak radio. 
The one I love has gone and left me alone. 
She got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio. 
She got a bag bad record on the heartbreak radio.
