Well, well, hey hey yeah now...
I got a brand-new baby and I feel so good
She loves me even better than I thought she would
I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb out of breath
When I see her tonight, I'm gonna squeeze her to death

Claudette, pretty little pet 
Claudette, never make me fret, Claudette 
She's the sweetest little girl that I've ever met
Got the best love that I'll ever get from Claudette
Pretty little pet Claudette 

Well I'm a lucky man My baby treats me right
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight
When the date is over and we're at her front door
When she kiss me goodnight I'll  holler "More, more, more!"

Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette
Never make me fret, Claudette
She's the greatest little... 
Greatest little girl that I've ever met
Got the best love that I'll ever get from Claudette Oh, oh, Claudette Yea, Yeah, Claudette

When me and my new baby have a date or three
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me

When my brand-new baby is my brand-new wife
