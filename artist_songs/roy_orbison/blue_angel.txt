Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh um

Oh blue angel, don't you cry
Just because he said goodbye
Oh, ahh ahh ahh
No don't cry

Oh blue angel, have no fear
Brush away lonely teardrops
Hey hey, whoa whoa

Well love's precious flame can just burn in vain
But you're not to blame
You thought love was a game and it's oh such a shame
But don't you cry, don't sigh, I'll tell you why
I'll never say goodbye blue angel

Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Wah wah wah wah
Dum dum dum dum dum dum

We'll have lovin' so fine
Magic moments divine
If you'll just say you're mine
I'll love you till the end of time

Don't you worry your pretty head
I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
Blue angel

Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Blue angel
Sha la la
