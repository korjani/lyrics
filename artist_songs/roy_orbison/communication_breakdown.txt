We never walk 
We never talk 
We never find the time To be close again
There it goes again
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown

Too much concern for money to burn
Too many things to do Now you don't need me 
And I don't need you
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown

One by one  They fail Now the leaves our lover
Cling to the ground
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown

Too much too soon  Too much temptation
In a hurry It's a sad situation
Too much worry I can tell  Well it's over now
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown

There it goes
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown

When it's right, it's all right
When it's wrong, it's all wrong
When it's gone, it's all gone
It's too late
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I can tell Well it's over now

Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
