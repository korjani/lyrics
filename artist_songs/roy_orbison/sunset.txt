I see her when the sun is high 
The clouds write her name across the sky 
But, the boss man is giving me the eye 
I'd better go to work, but I'll see her by and by 

At sunset I'm gonna see my sweetheart 
Gonna hold her so tight 
At sunset I'm gonna see my baby 
My baby tonight 

I see the shadows on the run 
I see the setting of the sun 
At last my working day is done 
The setting of the sun has finally come 

It's sunset I'm gonna see my sweetheart 
Gonna hold her so tight 
It's sunset I'm gonna see my baby 
My baby tonight 

I see her in the twighlight standing there 
The wind softly stirring in her hair 
The sweetest fruit the earth can bear 
So young so warm and so rare 

It's sunset, at last I'm with my sweetheart 
I'm holding her tight 
It's sunset and now I'm with my baby 
And she is mine tonight
