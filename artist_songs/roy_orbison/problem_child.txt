Well my heartbeat is running wild 
Because of you my problem child 
Oh-oh baby, don't be running wild 
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child 

Well don't you see this shakin' spree 
Is bound to be the death of me 
Oh baby, don't be running wild 
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child 

Well my heartbeat is runnin' wild 
Because of you my problem child 
Oh baby, don't be running wild 
Control yourself, don't be a problem child 

Well don't you see this shakin' spree 
Is bound to be the death of me 
Oh baby, don't be running wild 
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child 

Well then I'm gone, that's all she wrote 
You'll sing this same song 
Oh baby, don't be running wild 
Control yourself, you're a problem child 

Ooh, Problem child, running wild 
Problem child, running wild 
Problem child, running wild 
Problem child, running wild 
Oh baby,you're a problem child 

Slow down girl, down 
Slow down girl, down 
down girl, down 
Slow down girl, down...
