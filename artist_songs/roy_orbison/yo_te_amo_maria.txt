I'm a poor peasant boy, I'm a dirt farmer's son 
And I feel like a king when I know that my work is all done. 
For at twilight I know, there's a place I must go 
To sing my song of love for one who waits all alone. 
Yo te amo Maria, Maria amor, yo te amo Maria, Maria mi amor. 

Oh the beautiful sights, of the great city lights 
Where most people must run to try to have fun, not for me. 
For this woman of mine, is much sweeter than wine 
And I spend all the time I can find with my Marie. 
Yo te amo Maria, Maria amor, yo te amo Maria, Maria mi amor. 

Oh the joy of my life, will one day be my wife 
And we'll spend all our days watching the world roll on by. 
When her time comes to fly, to that home in the sky 
I pray the angels above will love her as much as I. 
Yo te amo Maria, Maria amor, yo te amo Maria, Maria mi amor.
