Those happy hours that we once knew,
Though long ago, still make me blue.
They say that time heals a broken heart.
But time has stood still since we've been apart.
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory 
Of old lone-some times.
I can't stop wanting you
It's use-less to say.
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.
Those happy hours that we once knew,
Though long ago, still make me blue.
They say that time heals a broken heart.
But time has stood still since we've been apart.
I can't stop loving you,
There's no use to try.
Pretend ther's some one new;
I can't live a lie.
I can't stop wanting you
The way that I do. 
Ther's only been one love for me,
That one love is you.
