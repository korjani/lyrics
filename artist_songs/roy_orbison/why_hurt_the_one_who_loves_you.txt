If you really love me, and you say that you do 
If you're thinking of me, like you know I think of you 
Why hurt the one who loves you? 
If you ever leave me, and you say that you will 
Then why deceive me, is it just for a thrill? 
Why hurt the one who loves you? 

You hardly know I'm around, and I need you more and more 
I beg you please stay with me and you walk out the door 

Why hurt the one who loves you? 
Have you got nothing better to do? 
Why hurt the one who loves you 
When you know I don't want to hurt you? 

When your new love leaves you, and you want me back again 
When you really need me, and you want me for a friend 
I'll walk away from you, and darling when I do 
You'll wonder why, why 
Why, why, why hurt the one who loves you?
