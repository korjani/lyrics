Felt this way yesterday,
Today I keep hurtin', yeah hurtin'
Time goes by, right on by, and I,
I'm still hurtin', yeah hurtin'.

You walked away, the pain began,
I knew I'd never love again.
Oh my heart tore apart,
And I'm sure hurtin', yeah hurtin'.

You walked away, the pain begain,
I knew I'd never love again.
Seems to me my destiny
Is to be just hurtin', yeah hurtin.
