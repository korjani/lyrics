Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy I sure am blue

She was my baby 'tlll he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

I'm free from romance  
I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me

Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
