Bum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah 
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love 
Come back to me 

16 years ago today early one Sunday morn 
Just before the break of day a cute little girl was born 
From that very moment on her life's been gay and free 
Laughing eyes and loving ways as sweet as she could be 

Bum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah 
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love 
Come back to me 

We had a quarrel I can't forget the night I made her cry 
Her tender heart just fell apart as she said good-bye 
Now today is her birthday my baby's sweet 16 
But someone else is in my place to hold my every dream 
Bum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah 
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love 
Come back to me
