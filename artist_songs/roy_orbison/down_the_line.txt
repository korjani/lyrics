Well, you can't be my lovin' baby 
You ain't got the style 
I'm a-gonna get some real gone love 
That'll drive a cool cat wild 
I wanna move, move on down the line 
Gonna get me a gal, then I go out on the town 
Well, I wanna move on down the line 
I'm gonna get me a gal, make some time 
She can't be square, she can't be slow 
And when she starts a-struttin' she's gotta go 
I'm gonna move, move on down the line 
Well, I'm in love, have been all the time 

Yeah, I'm gonna show you ain't so hot 
I'm gonna get what you ain't got 
She'll be sweet, won't do me wrong 
She'll be cool and twice as gone 
We're gonna roll on, roll on down the line 
I'm gonna get some love, lovin' that's truly fine 
Well, I wanna move on down the line 
I'm gonna get some lovin, truly fine 
A love that'll be twice as gone 
And when she starts a-struttin' she's gotta go 
I wanna move on, move on down the line 
Well, I'm gonna do right, do right all the time 
I'm gonna do right, do right all the time
