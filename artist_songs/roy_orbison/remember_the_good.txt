Yes, I suppose at times I think about her 
She was once so much a part of me 
Heaven knows I've learned to live without her 
And hell, it was, at times 
It was a painful memory 
But for all it matters now, If it does 
For all that tried to be, but never was 
For all the times I've tried, 
I wouldn't change it if I could 
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good 
I'll forget the bad 
All the good times we've had 
Won't make me quite so sad 
When I'm remembering 
And for all the times I've tried, 
I wouldn't change it if I could 
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good 
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good.
