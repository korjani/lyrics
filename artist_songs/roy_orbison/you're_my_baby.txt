I love that hair, long an' black 
Hangin' down to the middle of your back 
Don't cut it off whatever you do 
I need it to run my fingers through 
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar 
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby 
Got me a dollar that I saved 
Saved it up for a rainy day 
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due 
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you 
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar 
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby 

Got me a guitar, got a six strings 
And a picker to make 'em ring 
Every string's gotta know what to do 
'Cause I'm gonna use 'em to serenade you 
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar 
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby 

Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine 
But she run around on me all the time 
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through 
'Cause I-I'm plum-flipped over you 
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar 
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby 

Oh, baby-baby, yeah you're my baby 
Well I don't mean maybe 
You drive me crazy 
I love you baby, you're my babydoll
