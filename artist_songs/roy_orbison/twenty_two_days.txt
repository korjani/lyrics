Oh it's been 22 lonely blue days without a word from you 
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door 
The sun never reaches my doorstep each empty day seems to be the same 
You've broken your vow but I still love you now, oh this love of mine is a one way losing game 

And it's been 22 lonely blue days without a word from you 
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door 
The dreams that we share are gone forever but I still have a little hope in my heart 
Is this the way it ends? Are we to be both friends? Oh I can't go on if we're to be apart 

And it's been 22 lonely blue days without a word from you 
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door 

Yeah 22 days since you walked through that door 
Ah 22 days since you walked through that door 
Yeah 22 days since you walked through that door 
Mmmm 22 days since you walked through that door
