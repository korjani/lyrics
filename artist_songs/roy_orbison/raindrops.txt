Raindrops, raindrops 
I look out my window and what do I see 
Raindrops, raindrops 
They mark the pathway to my destiny 
Raindrops, raindrops 
Yes rain like the tears that fell from my heart 
The day you said we'd have to part 
And now what's left for me to do 
But watch those raindrops and cry over you 

You've stolen my love and my heart away 
Raindrops, raindrops 
And I'll feel the same for the rest of my days 
Raindrops, raindrops 
Well I've tried yes I've tried I want you to know 
I did what you asked I loved you so 
But I knew in my heart it wouldn't be long 
Till I'd look up and you'd be gone
