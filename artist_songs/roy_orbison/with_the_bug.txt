Well down through the ages. woman's had a time 
Tryin' to get her man to walk the chalk line 
To keep him on a string with a kiss and a hug 
But there's never been a man who wasn't bitten by the bug 

Yeah rockin' and rollin' with the bug 
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug 
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin' 
Yeah with the bug 

Well Delilah loved Sammy, but he wouldnt stay home 
Always runnin' and leavin' Dee home 
She set out to find Sammy late one night 
Found him down at the sand dune rockin' it right 

He was rockin' and rollin' with the bug 
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug 
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin' 
Yeah with the bug 

Well Helen of Troy a cool smile on her face 
She sported the face that launched a thousand ships 
But she couldn't control the wiggle in her hips 
She lost her fame and fortune, just one flip 

Well rockin' and rollin' with the bug 
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug 
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin' 
Yeah with the bug 

Well now Josephine, She had trouble from the start 
She couldn't keep her eye on little Bonoparte 
Every single time that Josie looked around 
She found her Bony runnin' round and round 

He was rockin' and rollin' with the bug 
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug 
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin' 
Yeah with the bug 

Well now, are modern times the same as history 
Even in the twentieth century 
And our future now well it's plain to see 
If we don't look out, the bug will get you and me 

We'll be rockin' and rollin' with the bug 
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug 
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin' 
Yeah with the bug 
Yeah, with the bug 
With the bug 
With the bug 
With the bug 
With the bug 
With the bug ...
