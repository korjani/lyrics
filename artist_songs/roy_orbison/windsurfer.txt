Windsurfer
All he wanted was to ride out on the wind
Windsurfer
To be one of the guys and to look good in her eyes

He practiced in his dreams
Trying to coast the waves
Most of the time he sailed alone
Endless summer days
Flying in the sun
He'd ride and wait for the wind
To take him home

Windsurfer

Windsurfer

He said let's sail away together
She told him no no never no
Wind windsurfer

It was early one morning
On a lovely beach
He left a message and 
He wrote it in the sand
Why do we always go for 
Something out of reach?
Nobody ever really understands

Windsurfer
All he wanted to do
Was outrun the sun
Windsurfer
To take her in his dreams
When the lonely day was done 
Windsurfer
