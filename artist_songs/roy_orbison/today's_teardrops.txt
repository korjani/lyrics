Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and tomorrow's rainbows we will 
Share me and you so dry your eyes, little girl, dry your eyes, 
And we're gonna see  skies of blue yeah, yeah, yeah 
Had a tough time gettin started, maybe you're just a little downhearted 
All you gotta do is a count to 10, baby you'll be smiling when, 

Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and tomorrow's rainbows we will 
Share me and you so dry your eyes, little girl, dry your eyes, 
And we're gonna see  skies of blue yeah, yeah, yeah 

Gonna be just a love of gladness, don't wanna hear nothin 'bout sadness 
Come a little closer come a to me, with each kiss you're gonna see 
Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and tomorrow's rainbows we will 
Share me and you so dry your eyes, little girl, dry your eyes, 
And we're gonna see  skies of blue yeah, yeah, yeah 

Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and tomorrow's rainbows we will 
Share me and you ...
