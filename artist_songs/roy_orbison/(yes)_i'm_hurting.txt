Everywhere I  go heartache just hurts me so 
I can't escape from you, and I'm hurting 
Sorrow is by my side, misery is my guide 
Every minute is blue, and I'm hurting 

Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay 
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you 

I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same 
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting 

Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay 
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you 

I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same 
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting, Im hurting
