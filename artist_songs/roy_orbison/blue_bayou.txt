I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes, working 'till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou

All those fishing boats with their sails afloat If I could only see 
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be

Go to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm going back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Oh, that girl of mine by my side the silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside
I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on Blue Bayou
