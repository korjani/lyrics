Look out now, love has done you wrong 
You can be weak, you can be strong 
But if you go on you can't look back, dont look back 
For you'll never be sixteen again 

It might be easy to stop and cry 
And let the rest of the world roll by 
But if you run for the golden sun, run now, run 
For you'll never be sixteen again 

Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again, you'll never be sixteen again 
No no no no, don't be lonely, there'll always be new romance 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, love is only a win, lose or draw game of chance 

And you'll never be sixteen again 
Remember the rainbow always follows the rain 
True love may be just around the bend 
So make time your friend, hearts take time to mend 
And you'll never be sixteen again, someday you won't regret, and you'll forget 
Ah, but you'll never be sixteen again 
Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again, oh no, you'll never be sixteen again
