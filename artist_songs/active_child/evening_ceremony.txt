Even if I wanted to love you,
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you,
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you

Hold me, hold me close,
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise I’ll take control
Even if I wanted to run with you,
Would you run with me?
Even if I wanted to hold you
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you [pray for you, pray for you],
Hold me, hold me close,


In the middle of the night
I feel your presence taking control
So many reasons 
Don’t try to take what you didn’t wanna start
So many reasons
Don’t try to take what you didn’t wanna start

Hold me, hold me close,
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise I’ll take control
Even if I wanted to love you
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you,
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you
