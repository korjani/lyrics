Go, go into this light
And cast out any doubts in sight
As we drink another glass of wine
I reflect on this troubled life

It's all because of you
In this life
Everything I do
I do it for you

Go, sleep no farther [?]
I let go, I drifted up so high
She sings, the sweetest lullaby
I reflect on this troubled life

It's all because of you
In this life
Everything I do
I do it for you
It's all because of you
In this life
Everything I do
I do it for you
