Baby's on fire

Boom
Boom, Boom

Showtime, motherfucker, it's on
Apocolypse now, I'm droppin' this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I'll stick to this spliff, I'm not klapping this bong
I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Oh, shit, sorry man, I'm stoned again
Ooh, now everythings getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk then I forget all my fokken lyrics
Like um, uh, who gives a fuck?
Don't worry 'bout it, just blow a kiss to me
I like danger, romance and mystery
I'm a lucky ducky, get mad shit for free
I rock more bling than Mr. T
I make it look easy 'cause it is to me
My daddy says it's lekker fokken spif to see
A South African cherrie makin' history

Baby's on fire
She's got me going fokken crazy soos a man naaier
O jirre God se Jesus

Baby's on fire

Hi-Tek, drop that four to the floor
I get real paid, what you think I do this for?
My bodyguard help me get to the bar
Neill Blomkamps makin' me a movie star
A lot of bad boys wanna piece of me
If you're a lucky boy I'll let you sneak a peek
My Zef styles motherfuckin' freaky-deek
I don't got beef 'cause I don't eat no meat
I'm on some other shit, yo, I know I speak unique
Fuck your whole shit up when I freak the beat
I love it when Kimmy talks sweet to me
C'mon, c'mon, Kimmy, Kimmy, speak to me
I take a trip down memory lane
Like yo, fuck fifteen seconds of fame
I'm a young blood comin' up fresh in the game
Yo-Landi Vi$$er, motherfucker, you all remember the name

Baby's on fire
She's got me going fokken crazy soos a man naaier
O jirre God se Jesus

Baby's on fire [x4]

Aaah, freak out!
No need to get so deep
Nothin' quite like a motherfuckin' techno beat
A techno beat - a techno beat
A techno - a techno - a techno beat
Just say what's up, don't try to get so deep
You know me, maar ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou nie - ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou - ek ken jou - ek ken jou nie

Baby's on fire
She's got me going fokken crazy soos a man naaier
O jirre God se Jesus

Baby's on fire

Flame on, motherfuckers
