[Sixteen:] Mommy, my heart is broken
[Yolandi:] Hmm?
[Sixteen:] Because my daddy might fix it!
[Ninja:] Yea, I'll fix it, come here
[Sixteen:] Mommy can you move away?
[Ninja:] Come lie in your space, I'll tell her to go fix it. I'll fix it, lie in the space here
[Sixteen:] But mommy can't have a space for me here
[Ninja:] She's just dreaming. She's dreaming. Let me make a space, yeah?
[Sixteen:] Heh, sorry
[Ninja:] No problem. Just tell me whats the problem. Is your heart, is your heart - how does it feel? What's wrong with it? Is your heart broken? Okay, I'll fix it
[Sixteen:] Fix it like this, do that
[Ninja:] Just give me one tuck, I just love you so much
[Sixteen:] I can't get a tuck because my heart is broken
[Ninja:] I'll fix it
[Sixteen:] My heart is fixed!
