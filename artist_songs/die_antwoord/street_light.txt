Underneath the streetlight, now, waiting for the shit to go down
Oh, no, there's going to be a murder, oh god, when the street lights go down

In Africa everything broken
Yeah boy, no money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
In the trash, empty streets where rattys rolling thick as thieves
Take your money if you rich
Take your life and rape your bitch

10pm - no body in the streets just yolandi and me night walking sipping wine, feeling fine, killing time
Night life wild if you feel like fun, some reason didn't bring my gun
I'm tipsy, giggly and taking selfies, taking bribes that made me wealthy
Sense the threat, from behind, we stop underneath the street light look past these 6 motherfuckers yep, 6 rattys rolling up on us

Underneath the streetlight, now, waiting for the shit to go down
There's gunna be blood on the streets, so much blood on the streets girl, when the shit go down, no, oh god

Fuck, we getting rolled on, wait don't mind us hold on, don't want to run away into the dark
6 rattys roll up on us hard, they stick a knife against my guts they take my phone, who gives a fuck?
Take what you want, I keep calm
I grab Yolandi's arm But a rat pull a GAT but it didn't go blaow
Mother fucking ratty only pull a gun now
Yolandi starts to fucking kick and makes me lose my fucking shit
I bucked the motherfucking rat with the GAT I kick and hit and bit this guy, stuck my finger in his eye, took this ratty's gun away, no bullets but the ratty's run away, sat the ratty over there he dragging my girl by the ass, she trying her best to get away he punching my girl in the face, what the fucking fuck think quick, I smash a bottle on a brick
Want some motherfucker? Like a wild animal

Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, oh no no
What did I just do, oh my god? oh, jesus fucking christ
Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, please forgive me
What did I just do, oh my god? I didn't mean to kill a man, oh no
Underneath the street light, oh, that's where the shit went down, oh, oh, oh god your mama gonna cry tonight, no, when she hear about the shit that went down, oh, father forgive me

In Africa everything broken
Yeah boy, no money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
In the trash, empty streets where rattys rolling thick as thieves
Take your money fuck the rich
Take your life and fuck your bitch

Everything broken
No money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
