Made by God

Even if it's raining, and the wind is blowing
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is pure, our love will protect us
Even if the world turns against us

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me

Yo, people of Earth
GOD is a DJ
And he loves you.

Even if it's raining, and the wind is blowing
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is forever, our love will protect us
Yes, even if the whole wide world turns against us

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
