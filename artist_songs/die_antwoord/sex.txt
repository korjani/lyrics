[Verse 1 - Ninja:]
No photo’s please, I’m having private time
Trying to fuck around with Rhymes
It’s cool yo, don’t sweat it forget it
Just walk away or whatever, be a fucking bitch
I’m fucking rich, I’m not sort of rich
I get bored of bitches, yeah import a bitch
(Is this shit really going down?)
Of course it is, about the time to freak the sorcerers
What’s up baby yo, and away we go
We’ll get there fast then we take it slow
I’m a hard mutha'fucker with a tender soul
Don’t give a fuck but I’ve got a heart made of gold
I switch off, forget about my enemies
You stare at me, like you’re not scared of me
Just absorb the mutha'fucken energy
You and me, we can build a memory
And make ya' cum, then I’ll make ya' cum some more
Harder than ya' ever fucking cum before
Then just fuck until you can’t, fuck until you
Can’t fuck no more, then fuck some more
And get Raw

Yolandi live a lekker life of luxury
Everybody know not to fuck with me
Na na na not the boss of me
But if you love me, I’m loving you loving me
My style so hot Versace copy me
Bitch don't be fucking with my bubbly
Do I like breaking rules? Possibly
But if you gonna do it then fucking do it properly
I rap real cute with an ominous tone
LA with the weed and i wanna get stoned
Chilling like a motherfucker puffing it slow
I pop it so fuck it, I’m shopping at Rome
When I get home visiting my ugly boys
In the hood yeah they making big fucking noise
Have fun with guns and a bum full of cum and love my bum, still with a little bit of
