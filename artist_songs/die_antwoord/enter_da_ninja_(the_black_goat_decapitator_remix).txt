After many years in hibernation, the grand dragon emerged from his cage, to sort over his domain

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection
[x2]

(Motherfucker! Ninja! DJ motherfucking Muggs!)
You need my protection
Boom, sweetheart
Anything for you, sweetheart
Ninja grab the microphone with no fucking brains on and go full retard
Watch me rip the rap game a new asshole
Ninja got that motherfucking cool-ass flow
(Come on Ninja let's go homie!)
My baby mama's first car's gonna be a motherfucking new Lambo
(Ninja kill these motherfuckers)
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Just a mic, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection
[x2]

Ninja got no time for these fake fucks
I'm a real motherfucker yeah we straight dog
(Straight fuck, motherfucker)
My nigga G.O.D
(Ninja!)
And Yolandi fokken Visser versus DJ Muggs
Ninja role with a lot [?]
Ninja kick that fucking new rap slang
(Poes, [?], fokken zef, jou nai)
Ninja bring the fucking ruckus like the Wu-Tang Clan
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
Yo, fuck them all, kill them all, let God sort it out
(Ooh, that's cold)
Yo, I'm a motherfucking Ninja

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection
[x2]

Fuck, this is like, the coolest fucking remix I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
Who said I was a loser
Who said I was a no one
Who said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the Soul Assassin studios
Los Scandalous California!
Enter the Ninja, Yolandi Visser, the homeboy God, DJ motherfucking Muggs
Decapitator remix, suck on this bitch!
Yo, yo I'm a motherfucking Ninja

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection
(Yo, I'm a motherfucking Ninja)
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Suck on this
Bokkie [?]
