[Verse 2: Ninja]
All my fuckin life I lived a normal fuckin life
Till I went and got myself caught up wif da mic
And da beats coming dope wif da rhymes and da flows
In real life trying 2 cope wif da highs and da lows
I got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
So I fucked my enemies up 1 time and blew da fuck up
B4 it was like yo: who's dis stupid weirdo?
Now it's like: it's a new breed of rap superhero
2 defeat deze devilz ninja bcomez a devil
Deze God-forsaken wretches will never b on my level
Wies jy? fuck u and your hole krew (who r u?)
I got u stressing double guessing cause I won't do what I'm supposed 2
I don't know u, baby say hello 2
My little 2 friendz: 'I'm telling u' and 'I told u'
Wat? try 2 speak but your tonguez frozen (what?)
In souf afrika I sleep wif both my eyez open

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ninja]
Muddafukkaz tell me 2 slow my roll but sorry no can do
My style is so brand new, I try 2 make u understand it
I'm here 2 steal da fuckin show cause baby I'm a bandit
Now u standing looking at me like da alienz have landed
All hail da great white ninja
Every poes wif a fone wants to take my picture (cunt)
Ninja! jas I dig dat oke! (jeez I love that guy)
Is it real? no it's just a big black joke
When dealing wif an idiot dere's really nuffing u can say
Next time u ask me 'is it real? ' I'm gonna punch u in da face
2 help u feel me, bitch I get paid 2 b funky
But b nice or I'm gonna change 2 b ugly
I'm zef like a young hugh hef, oh yes
May my enemies live long so they may see me progress
Put da peddle 2 da metal and I'm scorching my tirez
Middle finger in da air ja fok julle naaiers

[Hook]
