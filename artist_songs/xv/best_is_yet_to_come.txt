[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before, I'll be here long after you're born
Goodbye, I'm moving on, goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come

[Verse 1: XV]
Look here, who appear? Me oh my, well-well
Story of the Kansas boy, everybody tell tales
I'm so vocal, could have worked at T-Mobile
'Cause I got so many bars, I could probably sell sales
My city follow me 'cause I will never fair well, word is bond man
I could probably bail jails, I am back in black, hales bales
Team full of winners, nigga, we can't even spell L's
I came to entertain and I am doing damn well
Y'all phoning in, Alexander Graham Bell
Hang it up like 12 nails, if you can't tell
This is that wrapping up orchestra music, farewell

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before, I'll be here long after you're born
Goodbye, I'm moving on, goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come

[Verse 2: XV]
I know it all comes to an end, that's something I can't deny
So I ain't even gonna try to lie but I can put on in the end
And the outcome's a lion so I just live my life like the outcome is dying
And it is but I can't count my days like a Mayan
And my home is like my own little island
Try to go outside and search to find my own little Zion
But I don't really like what I am finding
To make sense of why I'm still trying, I guess it's called grinding
Hunting for the stars, you can call me Orion
Well I ain't trying to sell what everybody else is buying
I just find comfort in the fact that I'm arriving
To the conclusion of who wins when you went through every hoop
They threw at you like you hula-hooping and this is all I wanted
Go to Kansas and tell them I have done it, I love it because...

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before, I'll be here long after you're born
Goodbye, I'm moving on, goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come

[Verse 3: XV]
How is he who he is? All I know is these is trying times
And dying rhymes bring the life like de-fibs
Holy Moly gee whiz, school of hard knocks
I'm sitting where the Dean is, you wonder my feet is
I came to exercise the game like a Wii Fit
Tell everybody wave till the whole stage is seasick
We are the champions, now tell me where my queen is
Life versus living but I visit where my dreams is

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before, I'll be here long after you're born
Goodbye, I'm moving on, goodbye, the best is yet to come
I been here long before, I'll be here long after you're born
Goodbye, I'm moving on, goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye, the best is yet to come
