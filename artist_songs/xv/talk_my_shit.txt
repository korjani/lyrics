[Intro:]
Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again? Lemme talk my shit again

[Verse 1: XV]
Quote, unquote, over dope, crack with a dose of coke
Show my roots bare so yeah, they should know I float
Coming to America with dreams in an overcoat
Diving in queens like a king trying to sow his own
Sexual chocolate, give me the mic and I'm gonna make it off it
Then I just drop it, ahem clear my throat of that bull
But when it come to shit my nigga, I still talk it
Yeah, still walking in star war forces, still eat beats nigga, all four courses
Still stay swerving like I'm in Kentucky Derby
The way I be pushing out all twelve horses
Still winning while they all yell forfeit
Still killing rappers, leaving all hell corpses
Still with my crew in the silent two fortress, splitting up money like divorces

[Hook:]
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn't win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in
And I'm a be cool in this throne I'm sitting in
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again? Lemme talk my shit again

[Verse 2: XV]
This is pound sign Vizzy Zone, please tell my city I'm give and go
So you can probably expect mini clones, XXL didn't expect XV to excel
So before I enrolled, I was expelled, don't worry though
I'm fine, that shit don't eclipse me, it ain't blocking my shine
'Cause with my rhymes, I be on the cover of home and garden
And still be the coldest artist, I'm cold regardless
Flow is heartless, I know where I'm going like a homing target
They know he flawless when he came in the city with Chiddy Bang
And busy in any lane and they know when the Vizzy bang
Crazy how shit's changed in nine months
Steve Jobs couldn't feel the bitches that I touch
Please God, give your boy a hand when his times' up
Until then, I'm a keep tearing these rhymes up

[Hook 2:]
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn't win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in
And I'm a be cool in this throne I'm sitting in
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn't win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in
And I'm a be cool in this throne I'm sitting in
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Can I talk my shit again?
