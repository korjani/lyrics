I swore that I'd stop
Tryin to figure out what's wrong with hip-hop
After Soulja Boy dropped
And everybody thought there was a diss to Mims
Oh well, cause what the hell happened to him
I worked years on a record
And rappers all-of-a-sudden started comin droppin songs they come up with in a second
The radio plays it til the public done had enough of it and needs somethin even dumber to replace it
The quota hip-hop emcees are just as sad
Metros' dressings retro it's just a fad
Kanye might not be gay but y'all dressed like fags
Tryin to be him and express, but man poppin some tags
I hate the fact that I sound just as mad
As an abusive dad who's kids bedroom is trashed
And I admit for a sec I was on the fence
Cause that padded room got hot so I had to vent
I miss the days where a rapper had to have some cents
Before they even saw a dolla, imagine it
I don't mean rappers that rap about laba-rynths
And apart tires, and all kinds of bad-ass shit
What happened to freestylin in the park til it's dark
Paintin pictures from finish to start like it's an art
Now all I see on 106th and park is dumb dances and rappers that'd I'd rather hear bark

That's all I hear when these mufuckas rhyme and can't believe y'all got this mufucka signed

Here we go everyone's a rapper like hand me flows
When you know you wanna get a spin on the merry-go
I don't care if you were 12 years old and priest saw your rear-view even he wouldn't feel you
People tell me fuck it X, you can get a deal too
Just make one of them songs to make em all hear you
Then drop an album showcasing the real you
And that's what all these new young rappers that get deals do
Niggas don't even spit that raw anymore
They don't know a break from a kit-kat bar
They don't know the difference between a classic and a hoopty
And half they lives is outta a Martin Scorsese movie
And fans shake they head in agreement with what I said
When they ringtone is prolly snap ya finga, shake ya leg
We gotta put an end to the bullshit, indebted
I said it
And every single word, yep, I meant it
Does it take a T-Pain feature for y'all to get it
Download my mp3 and not a snippet
Make all my concerts free to get a ticket
And you can quote me on all of these lyrics

And now you hear it

So what's eating Gilbert Grape?
The fact that I'm filled with hate that makes a nigga feel this way
Or maybe cause I gotta deal with hate, from niggas I don't know, I could get killed today
See I went against the wind and I'm into they own alley
So that's kinda tough when you in this state
So while everybody was trappin, and bustin they macs
I was opening the window, like William Gates
My album Complex did amazin things for my city
Alienated me from all the cats that ain't worked with me
I charge four-sixteen and niggas like who is he
But hustlers know time is money, and I gets busy
So when niggas try to diss me I just laugh it out
Cause I don't think they even know what they mad about
Like local cats become rappers and of course they wanna battle
So I'm the default nigga they rap about
Oh my, I got bigger things to do
So I don't got time to sit and hate on yo mans
No lie, my money tight like a Jew
So why would I concentrate on yo camp
I came from the bottom to the top with a hand
Without Craig and the Power 93 band
Told em mamma's gone and they said I'd never be one
Payback's a bitch though I just want a refund
You were from the stars while bars just wanna see one, and need one
And have a baby mob on the key one
Sometimes I ask myself, what's the reasons?
That I wanna be part of this game and what it's become
And that's the question that I dance around to
And maybe on my album I'll have an answer for you
But til then I'mas keep dancing and snappin, smilin and rappin
And just wait and see what happens.
