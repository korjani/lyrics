[Chorus:]
The future of your life is right in front of your eyes
Just look up in the sky and I promise you'll see
A bunch of L7′s better side of the heavens
And if you ain't checkin than the time will be
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)

[Verse 1: XV]
The year is here
Watching us squarians lives appear
L7′s all up in the air
They scared, we gave them a warning like global warming
I guess they didn't care
Well, I would never ever allow that to control me
To see if you out last ya homies
Turn to XV when they weren't fucking with me like foreplay
Tehy abbreviated the OutKast like OK
It'd be a while for you see me, G
Next flow is PPV on MP3
Genuinely bare it all like MGD
But now it all seems closer like it's in 3D
Welcome to the future,
Flux capacitors capacity is to the maximum
While I'm asking them what's a masterpiece
Cause next year ain't gon be what it seems
Year of the squarians, 2015

[Chorus:]
The future of your life is right in front of your eyes
Just look up in the sky and I promise you'll see
A bunch of L7′s better side of the heavens
And if you ain't checkin than the time will be
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)

[Verse 2: XV]
It's like the second season of V
We coming for em all
They bitches screaming at me
For wishing on star
Surprising the fuck out of them, look
I'm droppping jaws, they leaving it up to me
To fix the ending of laws
They all on they toes
And niggas that spit flows is cool
But I feel like I got more to prove
So when niggas stay bussin' when y'all drove to school
In the cut like Neo's? in the open wound
Nominated for major dudes that supposed to lose?
I'm outta space cause I never was a local dude
Turned up noses and boo's turned to ohh's and oooh's
All the fans I have now are probably mostly new
Cause niggas drop off and knock off
They probably would never pop off
And though I know I'm plush
They won't let me get the shot off
And fuck em all, thought I wouldn't succeed
Til they see, next year will be 2015

[Chorus:]
The future of your life is right in front of your eyes
Just look up in the sky and I promise you'll see
A bunch of L7′s better side of the heavens
And if you ain't checkin than the time will be
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)

[xV:]
Yeah, you might be able to tell
Bout the atmosphere
Where we are, Squaria
Next year is the year that all Squarians been waiting for a very long time
I know that on Earth it's called 2011
But on Squaria, next year will be
2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)

[Chorus:]
The future of your life is right in front of your eyes
Just look up in the sky and I promise you'll see
A bunch of L7′s better side of the heavens
And if you ain't checkin than the time will be
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)
