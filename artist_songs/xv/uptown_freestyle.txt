[Intro:]
Yeah, October's very own, what up?
Just got outta bed, wanna make sure I still got
You know? Hahaha look

[xV:]
These niggas got it backwards, they should call me VX
Don't match me with no rapper unless it's who I V.S
Ask if I am cold and please do not B.S
Even if you know the answer's gonna be yes
I am what you get when you mix Reptar with a T-Rex
A true fucking hybrid and I don't mean no Prius
Hop out that Lexus GX to my girl crib out in TX
I'm creative in that sweep like Photoshop CS
I feel like wilding out on the DJ like D-Wrek
Act like I don't be making these hits like it's a reflex
They can look at you, just remember that V's next
The Fly Boy Club is like the '09 DX, P.S, somebody re-tweet Flex
And tell him that the kid with the green backpack
And JFK is the dopest rapper he met
From Wichita, Kansas where haters creep at
And Vibe's top 50 blogs is where I get my feet stacked
2dopeboyz is my fridge and nah right is my freezer
Her fetch is my dessert, I'm just trying to tease her
Your girl come to my show, you better leave her
They'll be talking about her on the web worse than Amanda Diva
In the game, a chamber trouble, make up like I'm Weezer
Out for R-E-S-P-E-C-T in Franklin's like Aretha
I'm grinding till '09 end and I'm not taking a breather
Got a concept in the beat, I will lace you with that feature
And niggas think success is getting deals, well oh well
Throw them deuces and have fun up on your shelf
Then I bail, Quasimodo over that lease, I'm ringing bells
I won't fail to stay off that milk carton and XXL
Niggas' egos haunt my mixtape but I try not to blame 'em
And everybody's nobody so I'll try not to name 'em
The picture's in my head and now it's time to paint 'em
You named your top ten freshmen, now I'm about change 'em

[Hook:]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
You can run and tell your friends that I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
You can run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on
