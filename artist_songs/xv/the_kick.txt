[Verse 1: XV]
Countin' my blessing watching Inception
But I'm living one of those scenes
Where everyone knows it ain't real except him
They can't convince him to believe
I know this life with all the lights and how it ain't true
But fuck it, I don't wanna leave
Cause you can never have deja vu
If you don't ever dream
Uh, successful stories never told to us
Tryna make ends cause we never got what was owed to us
School never grown on us, Pops never shown on us
Open sesame, see the street never closed on us
Moved white, and didn't see much green like a ski slope
Now I see so much green that I could be Hulk
And people think I relocated on the East Coast
But I still hold it down in the town I speak for
Towing my city behind me like it was repoed
In a game full of sharks but there ain't no cheat codes
XV can take a hike, I'm Tim Tebow
Matrix Reload, face it, he cold
Rep the 316 I'm 7 30 in the mind
I'm that dude hands down, 6 30 when I rhyme
I'm a 235, always in my prime
And it's 4.15, meaning it's my time
Was I a nerd cause niggas acted like dim wits
Or was I truly just gifted in academics
To get that with these lyrics that I was rapping like christmas?
I could number 2 on all of the doubters up on my shitlist
Pissed my little brother has to miss this
Told my momma she'll never watch from the sofa
Tell my haters, hit record on they remote controllers
Until til my totem falls over

[Hook:]
This is the life that I never will forget
I'm inside a dream that I never wanna quit
So I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick
I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick

This is the life that I never will forget
I'm inside a dream that I never wanna quit
So I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick
I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick
Wait for it...

[Verse 2:]
Lord can I change my life with these sentences
When I got boys doing life cause of sentencing
I'm dealing with it every night, that's what penance is
Barred like Bruce Willis but Die Hard With A Vengeance kid
And I'm in this party where all these women is
Tryna find where niggas with dollar bills and Benzes is
Finally left what I wanted for what I needed
Can't be the girl of my dreams if you don't close your eyes to see it
The road less travelled, where both of us were headed
Said it would kill us, I told you I won't let it
When my life was plain, most bitches jetted
You said boy I've been down like toe touch stretches
I even set expectations and you never ever met it
But I gave you my heart you ain't even call a medic
Now she telling me to leave her alone
But I can't like she got bad credit
I guess it's deaded with me and you both have left it
In eternal sunshine but my spotless mind won't forget it
So I accept it and pray no-one intercept it
Given the globe my soul and hope everybody accept it
Making it is never what you expected
I told my girl she'll never watch from the sofa
Tell my haters hit record on they remote controllers
Until my totem falls over.

[Hook]
