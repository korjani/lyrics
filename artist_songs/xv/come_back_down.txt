[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, let me swing into the scene like a monkey do
Trying to make a point real bad like our running shoe
Date a lot of girls but I'm married to my money boo
So why you trying to trip with me like this our honeymoon?
I am sitting comfy cozy childa meana Humphrey bogie
Seat up with my feet up in my neegas in a bunch of stonies
Light 'em up in the game, a chamber they call it my lair
Bitches in they bikini bottoms 'cause I is such a square
Yeah, the life I live don't ever bore me
Indian reservations, it comes with the territory, they wanna hear my story
How my name ring in mo' towns like Berry Gordy but they ignore me?
So I flew up to this planet I call Squaria
A place where any nigga with street cred would be weary up
Thought it was a bad choice like getting married young
But it was very fun, now all of a sudden they is telling me to...

[Hook:]
Come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They telling me to come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They is saying you is just too weird, yes you have made that clear
So I'm up in the sky 'cause I like the view up here
They told me come back down
They told me come back down, come back down to earth

(I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same)

[Verse 2: XV]
Far from it, my drive like Happy Gilmore, even if niggas still score
They going par four 'cause they have to still putt it
I'm making banks like Uncle Phil's mother
They think that I'm afraid to reach my peak but I got that hill covered
The difference between us is that he'll love her, he'll trust her
And wife her and I will still fuck her, ha-ha
Like a car sales man and I'm making it happen off of your stale plan
'Cause I'm bringing it back to when niggas could really rap
While y'all fuck up the tracks like derailed trams
When I go over your head like blimps, I still make sense like a weed filled van
I don't even see sale scams, I just put in the same folder as email spam
So when I'm gone and they listen to my song
They can never say that Don ain't do what he felt man till I...

[Hook:]
Come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They telling me to come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They is saying you is just too weird, yes you have made that clear
So I'm up in the sky 'cause I like the view up here
They told me come back down
They told me come back down, come back down to earth

[Outro:]
Yeah, you gone too far, reaching for the stars
You've done so much just to let it all slip away-away
Don't move too fast, gotta make it last
The world's waiting on you, just don't let it all slip away
Just come back down to us
