[Hook:]
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
I'm on the mirrors edge

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Stuck in the dream but I can't wake up
Sitting in a bank but I can't cake up
Don't want my girl but I can't break up
'Cause my every day life, I don't want to shake up
Feel the earth wake up, won't stay still
Haters all around but I won't stay trill
All up in my face trying to show their skill
Say they don't love it but I know they will
Before the show is over and the lights go out
After I wreck on the mic, show out
Married to the mob so wives throw out
Game all over that's right, blow out
What you know 'bout getting raise? We'd done thought of life 15 ways
So blaze up the endo
While I'm sitting on the ceiling with my J's on the window

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GLC]
Escalade get paid, nigga had to learn from mistakes I made
Dad couldn't teach me, he was laying in the grave
I didn't look there, hope God forgave
Now tell mama I'm on my way, tell me where she be her best
Got me out the hood, I recess, I smoke a lil weed to relieve my stress
Stacking 'em, making out to perfect, I got a new Cady out of my first bitch
Persist lil purple, seven in the alley, I took that risk
Running in a circle, running out of town
South side nigga just wanna flip me, rich motherfucker, that's all that is
I survived that, now I feel like this

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Looking out the window at another city's lights
Trying to make it home on another lonely flight
Because I'm running-running trying to find my way
But there's nothing-nothing-nothing I can say to find you on these days

[Verse 3: XV]
Mirrors on my walls in my new apartment
I never touch the floor, I'm like Aladdin's carpet
I'm feeling like a star but I'm remaining car less
'Cause I can run on walls like I am Lucy Lawless
They be saying I'm the next and I'm just hoping that is true
I took my number, got in line, just hoping I ain't number two
So you ask how I feel, I'm flyin', you ask about the deal in time
'Cause the boy from Kansas ran on the ground long enough now

[Hook 2:]
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
I'm on the mirror's edge, I'm on the mirror's edge
I'm on the mirror's edge, I'm on the mirror's edge
