[Hook:]
I said the top is so close, it's right there
I know you want to reach it with your hands in the air
Just a little bit higher
Higher
Higher
A little bit more
[x2:]
Go, a little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
Now go, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, how fly is a nigga like I?
Set the sky's so far, but I figured I'd try
To find out what a cloud tastes like
Scrumptious
What them niggas rhymes sound like?
Bubkiss
I try to talk to women like I'm Fredrick Douglas
But they just want me to take them to Fredrick's on Douglas
She don't want the sky, she just want to Skype
She don't want to see the light, she just want to be in lights
And the world keep turning
Feeling like EPMD, I need a Sermon
Cause like be a crock of shit like Steve Irwin
Crikey
Swoosh by like you bought stock in Nike
I stay in the studio
Because I know that life be like the hair on You-Gi-oh!
Wild and spikey
That's why me? I be so closer to sky chi
You just got to reach a little higher, just like me
A little higher, just like me
A little higher, just like me
High, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher

[Hook:]
I said the top is so close, it's right there
I know you want to reach it with your hands in the air
Just a little bit higher
Higher
Higher
A little bit more
[x2:]
Go, a little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
Now go, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher

[Verse 2:]
I'm almost there, reaching up like I need a hand
Convincing the pilot that we don't even need to land
Tell the beaches, get low, meet the sand
Niggas don't want to grow like Peter Pan
Fan of the Pixies but tell Wendy I don't use the dust
I just think happy thoughts and it threw me up
Left Neverland and it grew me up
Got the Net hooked, they pirating my music but it blew me up
Boom, Vizzy in the room
Feeling like that MFer and I don't mean Doom
On top of my cake like a figurine groom
Want to jump up to the sky before I jump over the broom
Zoom
I'm gone
Inebriated
Illy like I love you, abbreviated
Got stripes in the streets I raided all over my jacket like a Zebra made it
One day they'll say, "He the greatest."
Ha, one day they'll say, "He the greatest."
Just a little higher man, we gonna take it
High, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher

[Hook:]
I said the top is so close, it's right there
I know you want to reach it with your hands in the air
Just a little bit higher

Go, a little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
Now go, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher
I said the top is so close, it's right there
I know you want to reach it with your hands in the air
Just a little bit higher

Go, a little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
Now go, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
Just a little bit higher
