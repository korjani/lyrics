[Hook:]
I said the crowd, is so loud, and you don't ever want to turn this down
Cause isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
Cause isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
And the girls, look right, and they'll forget about me after tonight
But isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
Isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)

[Verse 1:]
Valedictorian, valet the Delorean
Dora The Explorer but my aura is John Dorian
Cause ever since I stormyied in, I was a Scrub
And they was everything, that a nigga wish he was
The deck's cut
I pull the joker, sippin' on some Ace Of Spades tryin' to be the king of clubs
Uh, I guess it wasn't in the cards
They tried to make me stop producing like menopause
I said, "Nah, that ain't all, gon' get 'em holmes"
Drama for my momma, so of course she had to send me off
I came back to the flat plains with a rap name
Head spinnin' like a nigga when his tax came
That fame's everything I wanted
Need extra dream catcher, I?
Traded my government for a name I wasn't
Vizzy, Vizzy, Vizzy, I love it

[Hook:]
I said the crowd, is so loud, and you don't ever want to turn this down
Cause isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
Cause isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
And the girls, look right, and they'll forget about me after tonight
But isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)
Isn't it awesome?
(Hell yeah, hell yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Hot lunch to box lunch, white Ranger lunch pail
To be cool, down for the wait (weight) like a dumbbell
Isn't it awesome?
Friends come around, try to Kermit The Frog 'em
Piggy back off 'em
Traded in my grandma's ride
For some shit that'll make a chick say, "Damn y'all fly"
Just to be a glimmer in your sandy brown eyes
But I kind of missed it when my grandma died
What's a real friend to a Twitter follow
Uh
Traded food for thought for an empty bottle
Uh
Morning with my girl or a night filled with plenty models
I got head but my soul feel like Sleepy Hollow
Astronaut dreams, all I get is space
At least I see the stars, I'm in a different place
A Different World, Dwayne Wayne gon' flip the shades
Take a glimpse at the game that I live to play

[Hook:]
I said the crowd, is so loud, and you don't ever want to turn this down

[Verse 3:]
Hello my lady
Hello my honey
Goodbye good girls
I'm Good Will Hunting
Hello Young World, who thought you could be nothing?
Look at life like McGuyver, I think this could be something
And I came from the bottom like Swamp Thing
Now I'm ridin' round, top down with a prom queen
Gettin' a big house out my mom's dreams
Only in America, could they make Don... King
Hakuna Matata til manana so I'm movin' like a Turtle stayin' away from Johnny Drama
Uh, so keep it movin' like a comma
I'm so far in, rasta
Amazin' like Grace not found I'm a Loster
Like Jack, John and Kate Plus 8, no fosters
The price of fame, you'll complain at what it cost ya
But in the end it just feels so awesome

[Hook:]
