[Verse 1: XV]
I'm just asking for cats with passion and is there any left?
Action and cameras flashing, I ain't getting any rest
When I'm unrecognizable, I'm still undeniable
They just feel my presence and say that's that nigga X
Yes and please do not confuse it
I got A.D.D so I'm the meaning of a movement
Niggas try to improvise while I try to improve it
Take a look inside just so I can outdo it
Nice on the mic but I make the meanest music
If they call it garbage, I swear I'm making the cleanest sewage
If my flow was in a purple top, the veins would probably lose it
The jocks would try to juice it and nerds would try to fuse it
Tired of trying to make these labels understand
That I'm the whole package like your mail's already ran
Stay sonning rappers, hope these faggots need a tan
Call me Adam 'cause you know I'm the man

[Hook:]
Right hand in the sky, I put this on the Bible
I'm a fly high 'cause I am undeniable
This is indescribable, take it where you got to go
And I just thought that y'all should know
My right hand in the sky, I put this on the Bible
I'm a fly high 'cause I am undeniable
This is indescribable, take it where you got to go
And I just thought that y'all should know that I am undeniable

[Verse 2: XV]
I make my entrance on that ramp
And all I wanna do is see they hands
I consider you fans Whoops, N and M are so close together
I meant to say I consider you fam
But I'm so out there, just to conversate, you need to stamp
Life is real, even for a cell phone you need a plan
But what I really am, most people don't understand
So I end up becoming spam, get it?
Oh my lordy, pushing 40, will I quit it or end up like Randy the Ram?
My son doesn't visit, the glory years are distant
Until a little kid says look, that's the champ
I try to see what they see, I get it, you hear music everyday
But you can not hear my tape and say that my shit is not crazy
20 mixtapes later, I am still not lazy and red lights still don't break me

[Hook]

[Outro:]
'Cause I am undeniable, damn it's indescribable
And I got a lot of hope that everybody got to know
My victory lap, I look back like where my rivals go?
Almost lost my way but today, I'm a find it yo
'Cause I am undeniable, damn it's indescribable
And I got a lot of hope that everybody got to know
My victory lap, I look back like where my rivals go?
Almost lost my way but today, I'm a find it yo because I am undeniable
