[Hook:]
I'm talkin' 'bout hoop dreams (hoop dreams)
My nigga had hoop dreams (hoop dreams)
Some niggas ball, some niggas shoot
When you from where I'm from, everybody wanna hoop
I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 1:]
Dwayne Wayne to Dwyane Wade, fire on him
So hatin' niggas that ain't paid put fire on him
But he was USA Jordan, nine on him
The old heads he used to hoop with even tried to warn him
Not everybody gets those dreams, even Ewing didn't get no ring
We see the beamers drive by and some guys won't get those keys
But we pray that Jesus Shuttlewsworth we hit M3′s
The dudes in his crew would move keys fast
But he passed like Steve Nash
Til the day that he need cash
Then he has to start to say
"Move dimes easy or make pennies the harder way"
Like get a job today, he says that's too boring
I'm too broke to pay attention, I'm getting what I'm affording
And girls watch from the floor and recognize him from scoring
Them rims on 23′s, now he's the new Jordan with his

[Hook: x2]
Hoop dreams, hoop dreams
My nigga had hoop dreams, hoop dreams
Some niggas ball, some niggas shoot
When you from where I'm from, everybody wanna hoop
I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 2:]
Carry heat like Alonzo, a nine like you Rondo
Then you hit the block, Dikembe Mutombo
Flew to the top fast, now you gotta drive slow
Yao Ming out in Houston with yo eyes low
You shooting for racks on racks
Got dreams to be Kareem, then match the stats
I'm talking Bill Russell rings, back to back
No Toronto, but some niggas just rap to rap
Cause everybody can't ball and that's a fact
But I came with the Magic, Shaq attack
My OG told me, victory's so sweet
But not everything, that's a Phil Jackson chat
I'm talkin' Bulls verse Jazz, I captured that
Cause I take all of the glory these cats could catch
Uh, my dudes ball, still out there shooting
Funny thing is none of them were hooping
But they had

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Biggie Sample]
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
