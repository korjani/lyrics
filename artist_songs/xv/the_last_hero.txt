[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
This is the last time that you'll ever see us
After this you're gonna go blind
This is the last time that there will be a last time
After this nothing will run
Cause I'm the Last Hero, I'm your only hope
And you got a lot to fear but as long as I'm here
I could be your hero, I could be your

[Verse 1: XV]
Live from the dust of ground zero
They living for the villains, I'm dying to be the hero
Different from the rest, but I was a proud widow
These mortals turned my heart colder than Sub-Zero
Ready for combat, I'm back no cape, no Speedo
Kryptonite backpack, Superman ego
Darker than a Batman Knight,
But I shine like a Batman light over my city and the people
Where's the leaders when everybody says follow me
So the leaders are also doing the following
140 karats just ain't enough for apologies
Or descriptions of what you motherfuckers are about to see

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
This is the last time that you'll ever see us
After this you're gonna go blind
This is the last time that there will be a last time
After this nothing will run
Cause I'm the Last Hero, I'm your only hope
And you got a lot to fear but as long as I'm here
I could be your hero, I could be your

[Verse 2:]
Who else gonna be one when they deficient of V12
If courage had a height ya'll would be elves
Dropping that wack shit, I would rather be shelved
Or be killed, or have my feet nailed to the pedal of a CL with three nails
Huh, iller than a nigga on the DL
Labels tried to sleep but I prevailed
When they saw me dropping shit in detail like?
Man I'm on fire this that Denzel, don't inhale
Jordan form the free throw, Dominique Wilkins windmill
I'm trying to do that with rap and then chill
And then still put on for my city, like I put on that green backpack
Yet they used to ID when they forget

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
This is the last time that you'll ever see us
After this you're gonna go blind
This is the last time that there will be a last time
After this nothing will run
Cause I'm the Last Hero, I'm your only hope
And you got a lot to fear but as long as I'm here
I could be your hero, I could be your

[xV: x2]
The planets align, the Earth is torn
From the sky, a hero is born
The view up here, few will see
A legend, a hero you will be

[Chorus x2: Patrick Stump]
This is the last time that you'll ever see us
After this you're gonna go blind
This is the last time that there will be a last time
After this nothing will run
Cause I'm the Last Hero, I'm your only hope
And you got a lot to fear but as long as I'm here
I could be your hero, I could be your
