[Intro: XV talking]
You know, they say that I'm like... gonna be the new wave of the next generation of music. I say...

[Hook:]
Just call me the Silver Surfer
We'll both float away when you're feelin' worser
Jump on the board when you bored
There's a couple galaxies that have never been explored

[Verse 1:]
You can call me the Silver Surfer
Riding new waves through the Cooniverse
Still trying to figure out what's my purpose
Is it spitting verses to make you flick your cursor?
Or maybe something bigger than my master galactus
Bigger than 80 songs?
That was just practice
Trying to take a leap? lashes
Until I have it all in control like a fascist

[Hook:]
Just call me the Silver Surfer
We'll both float away when you're feelin' worser
Jump on the board when you bored
There's a couple galaxies that have never been explored

[Verse 2:]
Don't smoke weed so the beats my high
There's no stars outside, they can't reach my sky
What you think I mean when I scream, "I'm fly"?
It ain't my fault that gravity leaves my side
You wanna scream outside, trying to see what I have in store
Windows blacker than a Labrador
Tidal wave coming, I ride like it's nothing
They talking bullshit to a matador
Y'all dudes is Doomed, masked and all
I know what I'm a do, I'm not asking y'all
I do my thing, Johnny Blaze on these tracks I Storm
What you think they say I'm Fantastic Four/for?
Ha ha
Flow cold, it's so nice man
And some people even mistake me for Ice Man

[Hook:]
But you can call me the Silver Surfer
We'll both float away when you're feelin' worser
Jump on the board when you bored
There's a couple galaxies that have never been explored

[Hook 2:]
Let's go to sleep on Squaria and wake up in the Milky Way
Explore the seas on Mercury and go to Pluto the same day
And we can land where nobody lands and put our flag in the desert sands
And go far, from Mars, to the stars, while we soar, on my board
I'm the Silver Surfer
I'm the Silver Surfer
I'm the Silver Surfer
I'm the Silver Surfer

[Hook:]
Just call me the Silver Surfer
We'll both float away when you're feelin' worser
Jump on the board when you bored
There's a couple galaxies that have never been explored
