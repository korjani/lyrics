Mississippi Queen, You know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, She taught me everything
Went down around Dick's place, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun Lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer. She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Mississippi Queen, If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, She taught me everything
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine

You know she was a dancer. She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Yeah, Mississippi Queen
