(ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)

We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell.
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown.
The final countdown

Oh!

We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
And welcome us all, yeah.
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

It's the final countdown...
The final count down [2x]

The final count down
Oh!

It's the final count down
The final count down [2x]

It's the final count down
We're leaving together
The final count down
We'll all miss her so.
It's the final count down.

Oh!
It's the final count down.
