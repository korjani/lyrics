Always lookin' for a good time
She came on just like a hurricane
Man she was far too hot to handle
Like fightin' fire with gasoline

All I needed was compassion
I'd been out there on my own too long
But she hungered for my lovin'
That first bite chilled me
To the bone

Bad blood
Runnin' through my veins
Bad, bad blood
Is drivin' me insane

Hey I've become a wild one
I'mnot quite the man I used to be
Just like livin' on a knife edge
That woman put a spell on me

Bad blood
Runnin' through my veins
Bad, bad blood
Is drivin' me insane

Always lookin' for a good time
I come on just like a hurricane
Now I'm far too hot to handle
Like fightin' fire with gasoline
