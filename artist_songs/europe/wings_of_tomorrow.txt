You must be dreaming,
Or going out of your mind
There's no way of changing,
The world over one night
Maybe you need to recover,
From all the things you've been through
Maybe you need to discover
That it ain't much left to do

Ride, ride, ride the wings of tomorrow
Ride, ride, ride to change the world

You feel sorry for the nation of 1984
And it cuts you like a razor
'Cause you've seen it all before

You've seen one war after another
So many lifes on the line
You must take care of one another
Or it's the end of time
