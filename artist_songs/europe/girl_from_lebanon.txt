It's time to break out from the cage
It's time to change your ways
It's time to find those
Shattered dreams
That vanished in the haze
It's time to lose those
Concrete shoes
They held you down too long 'cause
Trouble days have come and gone

And the night has just begun
Another dawn is yet to come
Carry on my little one
Girl from lebanon

It's time to meet the changes
They come from all around
It's time for you to realize
Freedom has been found
It's time to meet the future
And forget about the past
It's time to make a good thing last

And the night has just begun
Another dawn is yet to come
Carry on my little one
Girl from Lebanon

It's time to cut the barbwire
And walk out on the street
It's time that we stayed
Up all night
And lose all kinds of sleep
It's time to wear those bright
Blue jeans
And let your hair hang down
The word of peace is goin' 'round
