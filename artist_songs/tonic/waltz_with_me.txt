Waltz with me
My love
Tell me what
You're dreaming of
Hold me now
We can share our love
Waltz with me
My love

Paint your face
For me
Only here
Is where I want to be
Next to you
While I watch you sleep
Waltz with me
My love

Tell me something
Will we be broken down
Tell me something
Will we be broken down
Will we be broken down

[CHORUS]
Waltz with me My love
Waltz with me My love
