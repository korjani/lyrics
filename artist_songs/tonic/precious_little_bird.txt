It's the ringing in my
It's the ringing in my head
What I did and what was said
When the wind is colder
In the winter's coldest time
Only gray is what you'll find, oh, oh, oh

She's the one you're gonna hurt
She's your precious little bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the one you're holding down
She's the one you're gonna drown
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

It's the ugly finger
That is pointing in your way
'Cause you never do what you say
It's the one you're losing
It's the one you're losing here
'Cause you always live by fear, oh, oh

She's the one you're gonna hurt
She's your precious little bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the one you're holding down
She's the one you're gonna drown
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, oh, oh
She's the one you're gonna hurt
She's your precious little bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the one you're holding down
She's the one you're gonna drown
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She's your precious little bird
She's your precious little bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
