Holding lightly
Words that make you aware
Your head's spinning
No one knows you're not there
Blankly staring
Strangers call you a friend
The power you hold
Is a power that mends

You can't go on
No you can't even talk
Your future says run
But you can't even walk

So you harbor
Standing idly by
Indescretions, slowly turn into lies
Your're half empty
They don't know how it feels
The power inside
Is a power that heals

But You can't go on
No you can't even talk
Your future says run
But you can't even walk
