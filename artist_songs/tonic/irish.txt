I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier

For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your land away
For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your land away

So over the seas, over the seas
To kill a man that I have never seen
Over the seas.....

I won't die for England
Not for England

I said to me ma, said to me ma, said to me ma
I sail away now
I said to me ma, said to me ma, said to me ma
I sail away now

Over the seas, over the seas
Far away from my Ireland
Over the seas, over the seas
Far and away from miles of green

For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your children
For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your children

So they send me away, send me away
To kill a man that I have never seen
They send me away, send me away.....

I won't die for England
Not for England

Far away from my homeland
Many miles, many miles I would roam
Far from my home
Far from my home....

Far and away.....
I won't die for England
Not for England
