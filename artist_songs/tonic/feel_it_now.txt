Come on, my baby, don't say a word
Everybody knows it, everybody heard
You're giving it up to me just like I knew you would
Now you will never know what was never good

And I feel it coming down
'Cause I feel it now lighting me up again
Yeah, I feel it now, out of myself again
And I feel it now I'm on my way
And it's taking me back again

So come on give me sweetness, lay it on slow
You don't have to wonder where it's gonna go
You're giving it up to me just like I knew you would
But it will never go the way that I thought it should

And I feel it coming down
Yeah, I feel it now taking me back again
Yeah, I feel it now dragging me in again
And I feel it now, I feel it now
And it's taking me

And I feel it coming down
'Cause I feel it now taking me back again
Yeah, I feel it now dragging me in again
And I feel it now I'm on my way
And it's taking me back again

Taking me back again
