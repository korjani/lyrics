Oh tell the tale of the wicked soldier 
Oh tell the tale of the wicked man 
Oh tell the tale of the wicked soldier 
Oh tell the tale of the wicked man 
They say they heard him cry the fool's prayer 
They say they heard him cry the fool 
They say they heard him cry the fool's prayer 
They say that they just say that 
For oh my love's by the old tin wall 
She's waiting there she's waiting there for me 
My love's by the old tin wall 
She's waiting there - she's waiting there for me 
Some say the rope, she is hanging 
Some say the rope, she is free 
Some say the rope, she is hanging 
So say the rope to hang upon me 
So say the wise, she can't hear you 
So say the wise, she can't hear 
So say the wise, she can't hear you 
Some say that - they just say that 
For oh, my love's by the old tin wall 
She's waiting there - she's waiting there for me 
All others will compare to her 
She's waiting there - she's waiting there for me 
Oh my love I've waited here for you 
All this time 
Oh my love I've waited here for you 
All this time 
My love's by the old tin wall 
She's waiting there - she's waiting there for me 
My love's by the old tin wall 
She's waiting there - she's waiting there for me 
All others will compare 
She'll never know 
She'll never know 
She'll never know
