I never knew my father
I never knew his pain
Or that an empty home life
Would break him down again
So when I feel like running I have to look inside
I want to find the answer
I want to break my line

Fear falls down like rain
And it makes me whole again
Fear falls like rain

Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life are not tokens
I want to let you know that I'm still learning
How to love again and stop hurting

I want to roll my darkness into a million suns
I need to find forgiveness when all the pain is done
I want to hear I'm sorry, I want to let you go
I have to find my own life, I want to learn to grow

Fear falls down like rain
And it makes me whole again
Fear falls like rain

Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life are not tokens
I want to let you know that I'm still learning
How to love again and stop hurting

It makes me whole again

Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life are not tokens
I want to let you know that I'm still learning
How to love again and stop hurting
