I don't want be the one who hurts you
I don't want to be the one who fails
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again

I struggled all my life with empty moments
The shadow of a hole I'd never fill
Any happiness I had was empty
It wasn't good enough, I wanted love

I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again

I don't want to think of life without you
I don't want to take a step alone
It scares me to think I almost lost you
Just let me know you're fine, I'm on the line

I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again

I'm thinking of our whole life baby
Won't you help me find a way
I'm thinking of our whole life baby
Won't you help me find my way....

I don't want to be the one who hurts you
I just want to know that you're all right

I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
You can trust me again
Trust me again
