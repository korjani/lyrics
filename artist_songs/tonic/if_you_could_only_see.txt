If you could only see the way she loves me 
Then maybe you would understand 
Why I feel this way about our love 
And what I must do 
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says 
When she says she loves me 
Well you got your reasons 
And you got your lies 
And you got your manipulations 
They cut me down to size 
Sayin' you love but you don't 
You give your love but you won't 
If you could only see the way she loves me 
Then maybe you would understand 
Why I feel this way about our love 
And what I must do 
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says 
When she says she loves me 
Seems the road less traveled 
Show's happiness unraveled 
And you got to take a little dirt 
To keep what you love 
That's what you gotta do 
Sayin' you love but you don't 
You give your love but you won't 
You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there 
Sayin' you love where you stand 
Give your heart when you can 
If you could only see the way she loves me 
Then maybe you would understand 
Why I feel this way about our love 
And what I must do 
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says 
When she says she loves me 
Sayin' you love but you don't 
You give your love but you won't 
Sayin' you love where you stand 
Give your heart when you can 
If you could only see the way she loves me 
Then maybe you would understand 
Why I feel this way about or love 
And what I must do 
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says 
When she says she loves me
