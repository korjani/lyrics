Oh my sugar she won't bend 
Fly with me 
On your love she will depend 
Fly with me my Love 
When you're down feeling low 
Not quite paid for not quite sold 
And they all have got you tricked 
And the world has made you thick 
My love she dreams 
And she sleeps with broken faces inside 
Cold water runs deep 
When she sleeps with broken faces 
I can wonder she can see 
I roll over she will breathe 
All the others make you smile 
Just lay back girl don't drive for a while 
My love she dreams 
And she sleeps with broken faces inside 
Cold water runs deep 
When she sleeps with broken faces 
Oh my sugar she won't bend 
Fly with me 
On my love she will depend 
Fly with me 
My love she dreams 
And she sleeps with broken faces inside 
Cold water runs deep 
When she sleeps with broken faces
