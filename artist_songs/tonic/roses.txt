If you want to be my best friend
Then show it
If you want to live inside me
Don't blow it

I don't want to stand in line
I don't want to waste my time
I just want to be the one

I don't want to be around
When you come down
I just wanted you to know
The roses always grow

If you want to hear I love you
Then say it
If you want to hear I need you
The prove it

I don't want to stand in line
I don't want to waste my time
I just want to be the one

I don't want to be around
When you come down
I just wanted you to know
The roses always grow

Did you think it would last forever, baby
Did you think I would drag you under

I don't want to be around
When you come down
I just wanted you to know
The roses always

I just want to be with you
Not alone
I just wanted you to know
The roses always grow
