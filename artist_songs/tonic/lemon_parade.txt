I wish I'd seen you as a little girl 
Without your armor to fend off the world 
I would have kept you underneath my wing 
I would protect you from everything 
Make way for the lemon parade 
Make way for my girl 
Make way for the lemon parade 
Make way for my girl 
Did the boys all tease you when they had 
the chance 
Always left standing when it came time 
to dance 
Did you hide behind your books girl 
Did you find your secret friends 
Always I'll want you 
Always 'till the end 
Make way for the lemon parade 
Make way for my girl 
Make way for the lemon parade 
Make way for my girl
