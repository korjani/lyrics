It's the way he looks at you 
That says to me 
This isn't over 
From the outside looking in 
You see there's nothing sacred here 
Nothing sacred 
You can bend 
But you can't break 
For the reasons out of our control 
You try to make it roll 
Like a dice away 
But you say that you're all empowered here 
This is obviously not clear enough 
To me 
You can bend 
But you can't break 
Hey little girl keep dancing 
Hey little girl keep dancing alone 
'Cause there's not enough time in your day 
To keep you here 
The soldier's daughter 
Did your daddy 
Did your daddy hurt you 
Did he make you feel bad 
Did he poison your views 
With the water he was raised on 
Oh your father's son says hang on 
Hang on 
Hey little girl 
Keep dancing 
Hey little girl 
Keep dancing alone 
'Cause there's not enough time in your life 
To stay here 
So over the hills he'd climb 
Just to see her there in time 
Just to watch the sun shine through her dress 
The sweet soldier's daughter 
The sweet soldier's daughter
