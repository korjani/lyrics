Swallow your pride 
Make way for the new bride 
Holding your tongue 
When they call another winner 
Oh there is more to this life 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
Tell me how does she feel 
She's like the wind 
That boy couldn't sail 
He says I've washed these decks for years 
I've carried those pails 
And oh there is more to this life 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
Tell me how does she feel 
Does she hold you in the night 
Does she tell you everything's gonna be alright 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
How does she feel 
Captain oh my captain 
Steer the first mate true 
The men they sing a song of fear 
Ghosts of ships who failed before 
And the captain he is laughing 
You can't control the sea 
She will always do as she pleases 
It's her nature to be free 
And oh there is more to this life 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
Tell me how does she feel 
Do you hold her in the night 
Do you tell her everything's gonna be alright 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
I know how you feel 
Oh, I know 
Oh, I know 
Hey Mr. Golden Deal 
How does she feel
