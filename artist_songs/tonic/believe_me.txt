Love, I hope you won't be late
You know, how much I hate to wait
Believe, my heart is in your hands
And our life is like a song

When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me

Life, is more than we can know
Faith, is something we can show
I would love, I would lie
I would give, I would die
Cause our life is like a song 

When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me

Sometimes we draw the line
And people remain where they don't belong
It so easy to say what you need
Sometimes it just goes away

When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me

It so easy to say what you need
Sometimes it just goes away
