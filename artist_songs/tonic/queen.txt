Head strong and steadfast junkies
All barter for the clean
They all wait in their plastic lines
To find what color means

Cause they all wanna be queen
And you do know what I mean
Cause they all wanna be queen
And you do know what I mean

I spoke to a girl by the backdoor
She said she'd do anything just to meet you
You know I've seen that smile before
Just in time for a knee to hit the ground
Little girls
Dressed up like French whores
In velvet paintings
Wide eyed
Long nails
They all wanna live the fairy tale

[CHORUS]

Did they tear you all up inside
Did they take away your pride
and she cried herself to sleep that night

Cause they all wanna be queen
And you do know what I mean
Cause they all wanna be queen
And you do And you do And you do
know what I mean
Queen wanna be queen
Queen wanna be queen
Queen wanna be queen
Queen wanna be queen
