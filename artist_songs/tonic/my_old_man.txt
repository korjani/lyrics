Me and my old man 
Don't see eye to eye 
We take our walks outside 
Underneath the birch trees 
He said I think it's gonna freeze this year 
I said I gotta get away from here 
Me and my old man 
Me and my old man 
Should have been enough to know 
That you'd let us all down 
Could have been enough to try 
Without making a sound 
It's all part of the plan my dear 
It's all part of the plan my dear 
So we walked along the mending walls 
Laid beneath the tortured talls 
And we sang a song of newfound cheer 
Laughed at the passing years 
Yeah we talked about things to come 
Talked about the battles won 
He said I think it's gonna freeze this year 
I said I gotta get away from here 
Should have been enough to know 
That you'd let us all down 
Could have been enough to try 
Could have been enough to try 
Oh I've been such a fool 
Spent my life waiting for you 
Through these trees I see 
With my father's eyes 
I realize the weight 
Should have been enough to know 
That you'd let us all down 
Could have been enough to try 
Without making a sound 
It's all part of the plan my dear 
It's all part of the plan my dear 
It's all part of the plan my dear 
Between me and my old man 
Gotta get away from here 
Gotta get away from here
