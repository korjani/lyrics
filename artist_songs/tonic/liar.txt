I fell down on my head
Made me start to wonder
How I'd grown so mad
Knocked me from the shit that I was under

So take another shot boy
I'm open
Nobody knows a liar
You can never break me
I'm already broken
Nobody knows a liar like I do

Sugar my love, they have done you wrong
Held you down and kept you from creating
Everything that you do takes too long
So keep in my heart something precious
Never learn to be malicious

So take another shot boy
I'm open
Nobody knows a liar
You can never break me
I'm already broken
Nobody knows a liar like I do

So take another shot boy
I'm open
Nobody knows a liar
You can never break me
I'm already broken
Nobody knows a liar like I do
