She 
She came down 
From the mountain 
And I 
I stood my ground 
On the mountain 
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust 
I can't run from her but Lord I must 
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
She 
She came down 
From the mountain 
And I 
I stood my ground 
On the mountain 
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust 
I can't run from her but Lord I must 
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
She's got a sweetness about her 
That I can't explain 
She's got a wonderment about her 
That I can't deny 
And if we are patient 
Then maybe we'll get it straight 
On the mountain 
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust 
I can't run from her but Lord I must 
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
I'm gonna burn calling her name 
Oh I'll burn calling her name
