Choosing stones... 
Big enough to drag me down 
Where I am... 
People's voice's make hollow sounds 
Just be quiet... 
They'll go away 
Open up your eyes... 
Don't let your mind tell the story here 
Open up your eyes... 
Just let me go 
It's so safe... 
It's so safe floating in the glass 
While above... 
While above all your troubles pass 
Just be quiet... 
They'll go away 
Open up your eyes... 
Don't let your mind tell the story here 
Open up your eyes... 
Just let me... 
Open up your eyes... 
Don't let your mind tell the story here 
Open up your eyes... 
Just let me go, let me go, let me go 
Open up your eyes... 
Just let me go...
