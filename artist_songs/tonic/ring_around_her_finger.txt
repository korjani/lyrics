She wears a ring around her finger
Shiny platinum diamond stone
Somewhere my love is hurting
She's alone again tonight

Maybe we promised way to early
Maybe we won't survive the road
Because back home it's way to early
to call her on the phone

so give me love
give me fascination
give me strength that I can save my relationship

I've been alone before
I don't want to be alone again
I see my life through that door
I'm gonna open up and let it in
God let me in, god let me in

So we dream about tomorrow
And we struggle for today
But somewhere we'll find the answer
To the price we'll have to pay

so give me love
give me fascination
give me strength that I can save my relationship

I've been alone before
I don't want to be alone again
I see my life through that door
I'm gonna open up and let it in
God let me in, god let me in

There was a time that I could not believe
It's so simple just to love and leave
It was in the end that I found my way again

so give me love
give me fascination

I've been alone before
I don't want to be alone again
I see my life through that door
I'm gonna open up and let it in
God let me in, god let me in
