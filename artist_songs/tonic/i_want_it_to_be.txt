If I gave you all my secrets
Do you think that you could keep them?
If I gave you all my anger
Do you think that you could take it?

'Cause I want it to be
Something bigger than me

If I showed you all my castles
Would you teach me not to burn them?
If I opened up my heart strings
Could you show me how to heal them?

'Cause I want it to be
Something bigger than me
And I want you to know
There's no place to go

It was love that you gave to me
I want you to know, I want you to know, oh
It was love that you gave to me
I want you to know, I want you to know

'Cause I want it to be
Something bigger than me

If I gave you all my secrets
Would you promise not to keep them?
