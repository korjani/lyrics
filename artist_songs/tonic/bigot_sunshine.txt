Big wings 
And small waters 
Carry me back home 
Small minds 
Stand protected under bigot sunshine 
I'm not alone 
But I'm far from home 
You can never go home again 
You can never go home again 
Main street 
Standing naked on the Fourth of July 
Down stream 
All the maniacs on my face they spy 
I'm not alone 
But I'm far from home 
You can never go home again 
You can never go home again 
You can never act the way that you did back then 
I'm not alone 
But I'm far from home 
You can never go home again 
You can never go home again 
You can never act the way that you did back then 
You can never act the way that you did back then 
When you were just a little boy
