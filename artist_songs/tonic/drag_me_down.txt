There's a reason why the words got
hard for me to bare
Because within them was the promise of
a life that just wasn't there
You're not my friend and I have no doubt
That I finally figured it out

You're trying to drag me down [x4]

Was it hate or was it hurt
that led you to be this way
Did you want it all for nothing
Did you think that would be OK
I did everything I could for you
Still you wanna run me through 

[CHORUS]

I did everything I could for you
Still you wanna run me through
You're trying to drag me down [x4]
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
