Where do I fit inside of it?
Where do I stand? What is the plan?

I long to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I want to be more simple, oh

But what is the plan for all of this?
Where do I crawl? Where is the wall?

I long to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I want to be more simple, oh

Long night's strain
Teach us change from fear

I live to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I long to be more simple, oh

What is the plan inside of here?
