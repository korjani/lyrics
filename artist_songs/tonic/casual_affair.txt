So you give it all 
In the world today 
You say it's all about the passion 
And the wars you wage 
I'm not saying I'm one for violence 
But it keeps me hangin' on 
It's a casual affair 
When everybody loves you 
Oh they'll pay top dollar 
Make you wear the dog collar 
When everybody loves you 
I said I'm not afraid of change 
I'm not afraid to lose 
They say it's all about the sacrifice 
And the weapons you choose 
Like I said I'm not one for violence 
But it keeps me hangin' on 
It's a casual affair 
When everybody loves you 
Oh they'll pay top dollar 
Make you wear the dog collar 
When everybody loves you 
It's a casual affair 
When everybody loves you 
Oh they'll pay top dollar 
Make you wear the dog collar 
When everybody loves you 
It's a casual affair 
When everybody loves you 
Oh they'll pay top dollar 
When everybody loves you 
It's a casual affair 
It's a casual affair
