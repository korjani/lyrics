Make up your mind, choose and bear it
If you lose, you can't share it now
Your indecision is self destruction
A little window into your dysfunction now

But you said, you said you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say

I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know, it hurts you like you say

But you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it

When was this about the institution
You beat yourself until there's no solutions now
It got so bad, you can't see it
You're in so far, you can't leave it now, now

But you say
You say, you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say

I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know it hurts you like you say

But you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
Say, you say, you say you want it, whoa, whoa, say

You say, you say, you say you want it
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say

I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know it hurts you like you say

And you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
Say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
