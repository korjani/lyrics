Baby I'm in love
Baby I'm in love

[Verse One:]

Ah, don't be checking me
Baby I ain't free
Maybe on my own but
I'm not alone
I got, I got a good thing
Doesn't really matter boy what you have
I don't need no rock to be off the block
No more tears you bring, gonna change a thing
What we have is so real
You don't need to prove to me how he feels

[Bridge:]

Cuz I'm in too deep
To blow a good thing
And one nice mischief
Could cost me everything thing I want

[Chorus:]

Cuz baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Baby in a different place of time
Baby that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love

[Verse Two:]

It's the cheapest talk and the foolish walk
To be running games, and be hiding things
Behind the one you loves back
Don't be doing him, run like that
Yes it's flattering that you're feeling me
But I got to say that it's all for me
There's nothing that I will do (nothing I will do)
To run the risk of losing him over you

[Bridge:]

Cuz I'm in too deep
To blow a good thing
And one nice mischief
Could cost me everything thing I want

[Chorus:]

Cuz baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Baby in a different place of time
Baby that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love

[Verse Three:]

Cuz my heart
Is taken by the one
That I got
And I am going to prove
That you can trust someone
The one you love

[Chorus:]

Cuz baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I've got plans with the one I'm with
They're a lifetime of being true
Baby in a different place of time
Baby that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

[repeat chorus 2x]

Oh baby I'm in love with the one I'm with

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
