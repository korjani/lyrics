Just let go stop livin' for now
It's better than it's been before
Trust your heart, you'll make it some how
It's everything you're looking for

[Bridge:]

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
Try your best to forget yesterday
A little bit of sun
Without the rain
Now there's nothing in your way

[Chorus:]

Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
You know what is right
Out of mind is out of sight
Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
Learn to read the signs
Out of sight is out of mind

[Verse Two:]

Now life's to short
So let's make it last
Now it's time for moving on
Things can change
Some throw it away
Forget it, what is done, it's done

[Bridge:]

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
Try your best to forget yesterday
A little bit of sun
Without the rain
Now there's nothing in your way

[Chorus:]

Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
You know what is right
Out of mind is out of sight
Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
Learn to read the signs
Out of sight is out of mind

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
A little bit of sun
Without the rain

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
A little bit of sun
Without the rain

[Chorus:]

Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
You know what is right
Out of my mind is out of sight
Don't look back
Keep straight ahead
Learn to read the signs
Out of sight is out of mind

[repeat chorus 2x]

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
A little bit of sun
Without the rain

A little bit of joy
To ease the pain
A little bit of sun
Without the rain
