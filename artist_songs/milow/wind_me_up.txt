Feels like a broken toy, waiting to be destroyed
Time keeps on creepin' by, every hour
She's like a loaded gun, waits for the settin' sun
Time keeps on stepin' by, every hour

She was the queen of silver linings
Now she is the one who lives with ghosts

Spinning out of control, hoping this heartache will end
Trying hard to let go, she's tired, she's empty again
She says, wind me up

It's always a little while 'fore she remembers
Why nobody's coming home, so there's no purpose
She lost a musical five years at Vertigo
There's nothing left to give on the surface

She was the queen of silver linings
Now she is the one who lives with ghosts

Spinning out of control, hoping this heartache will end
Trying hard to let go, she's tired, she's empty again
She says, wind me up [x3]

Hurry up, you're runnin' in circles
Just hurry up, time keeps on slippin'
Just hurry up, there's no one but you here safe

Spinning out of control, hoping this heartache will end
Trying hard to let go, she's tired, she's empty again
She says, wind me up [x3]
