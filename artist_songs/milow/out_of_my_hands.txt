I made the call just too late
At the end of May
I just thought I could wait
For one more day
In the time that passed
You went down so fast
You went down so fast

Out of my reach, out of my hands
I didn't understand
I would have changed all my plans

An empty house, a setting sun
At four a.m.
Some battles fought are battles won
But this ain't one of them
One more shadow cast
You went down so fast
You went down so fast

Out of my reach, out of my hands
I didn't understand
I would have changed all my plans
I would have changed
Out of my reach, out of my hands

Now the leaves are turning brown
I watch 'em blow
Where the earth pulls them down
I let you go
As your breath unwinds
Through the restless pines

Out of my reach, out of my hands
I didn't understand
I would have changed all my plans
I would have changed
Out of my reach, out of my hands
I didn't understand
I would have changed all my plans
I would have changed
