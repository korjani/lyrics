Hey man, I'm tired of working all day
I'm turning into a daysleeping walking cliche
Hey man, let's wait until daylight fades
And we'll join the dreamers and renegades

Hey, have you heard the radio news
They say that soon all hell will break loose
Me, I am trying to do my part
But really changing the world seems so hard

Hey man, I'm tired of working all day
I'm turning into a daysleeping walking cliche
Hey man, let's wait until daylight fades
And we'll join the dreamers and renegades

Girl, let's just empty this bottle of booze
And swirl all night in our dancing shoes

Hey man, I'm tired of working all day
I'm turning into a daysleeping walking cliche
Hey man, let's wait until daylight fades
We'll join the dreamers and renegades

Hey hey hey, just you and me girl, what do you say
Hey hey hey, just you and me girl, what do you say

Hey man, I'm tired of working all day

Hey man, I'm tired of working all day
I'm turning into a daysleeping walking cliche
Hey man, let's wait until daylight fades
And we'll join the dreamers and renegades

We'll join the dreamers and renegades

Dreamers and renegades
Dreamers and renegades

We'll join the dreamers and renegades
