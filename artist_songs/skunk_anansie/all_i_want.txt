ALL I WANT IS A MIRROR
SO I CAN SEE THIS SO CALLED BRIGHTER DAY
I`M WATCHING ALL THE WORLD CRAWL BACK AGAIN
WATCHING HOW IT BLOWS ITSELF AWAY

THAT`S ALL I WANT [X 4]

ALL I WANT IS DESTRUCTION
I WANNA SEE IT CRUMBLE BENEATH MY TOES
SMELL THE WAY MY SORE EYES BURN AWAY
I WANNA SEE IT ALL TODAY

THAT`S ALL I WANT [X 4]

ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE ME 
SO YOU CAN SCREW ME UP
AND DON`T GIVE A DAMN
`COS I`M A CRAZY LITTLE DAISY
TO VILE TO BREATHE
THAT`S ALL THAT I CAN HAVE TODAY

THAT`S ALL I WANT [X 4]
