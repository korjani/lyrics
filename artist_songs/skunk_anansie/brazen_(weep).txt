I CALLED YOU BRAZEN 
CALLED YOU WHORE RIGHT TO YOUR FACE
AND WATCHED YOU SILENTLY
AND PUBLICLY DISGRACED

I DIDN`T NOTICE WHEN YOU STRENGHTED
LIKE A VICE
THAT YOU WERE TREMBLING AND BURNED
BENEATH THE ICE, OOH, OOH

WHY DON`T YOU WEEP
WHEN I HURT YOU
WHY DON`T YOU WEEP
WHEN I CUT YOU
YOU DON`T BLEED 
AND THE ANGER BUILDS UP INSIDE [X2]

NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,

YOU SAID A PRAYER
AND I BETRAYED YOU WITH A KISS
I NEVER REALIZED
THAT ALL HAD COME TO THIS

SO KEEP YOUR DIGNITY
DON`T THROW IT ALL TO WASTE
STRONGER FEELINGS
THAN YOU`VE EVER LEARNED TO FACE, OOH

[REPEAT CHORUS]
