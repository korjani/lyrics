WHY DO I SENSE, BENEVOLENCE
YOU STAND TALL AT MY GREAT EXPENSE

THICK WORDS OF GRATITUDE, WHAT A PRICE TO PAY
STUCK IN MY THROAT, I SELL EVERY WORD I SAY

BUT I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
TWISTING ME ROUND
I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
KEEPING ME DOWN.....

YOU PITY ME WITH YOUR TASTELESS GESTURES
GRATITUDE FOR KIND
BUT YOUR BLUDGEONED, INTENTIONED OBJECTIVES
ARE SCREWING WITH MY MIND

BUT I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
TWISTING ME ROUND
I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
KEEPING ME DOWN.....

BUT I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
TWISTING ME ROUND
I DON`T WANT YOUR CHARITY
KEEPING ME DOWN.....
