I've been looking through my mirror 
With somebody else's eyes 
You broke me down 
You fixed my blood staind pride 
I've running through my window 
At somebody else's world 
You let me fall 
Right through your open door 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
I've been running hard on empty 
Sinking deeper in the sand 
You let me down 
Right on to solid ground 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
When everyone left me you loved me and no one else 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 

I had hope in my heart 
That you'd run for me 
Can saved it all 
Now I feel in my heart that you've come for me 
You leave me love 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
When everyone left me you loved me and no one else 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
Baby you saved me from myself 
Baby you saved me from myself 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself 
When everyone left me you loved me and no one else 
You came and saved me you saved me from myself
