No I don't want love you, 
`Cos I know who you are,
That`s why I`ve been staying away from you,
That is why I ever call,
Huummm, I know that you could possess my body,
And I know you could make me scrawl
I know you`d have me shaken,
Have me climbing the wall
That`s why I don`t wanna` love you

[Lenny Kravitz]
`Cos I know how you are
Sure you say you`re right on and your righteous, girl
Come with me, I know you`d be right off
`Cos I know you could possess my body, 
I know you could make me crawl,
And just as hard as I fall for you girl, 
Well you know you would fall for me harder
That`s why I don`t want to love you

[Skin]
`Cos I know what you would do to my heart
You scourge me like a hot iron,
Leave me whining all alone in the dark,
`Cos I know that you would make me suffer 
I know that you would drive me wild ( that`s right ) wild
You would take me in a circle
And when it gather you, I know you`d disappear
That`s why I don`t wanna` love you

[Lenny Kravitz]
`Cos I know you like to be in charge,
And with me you know you can`t control me, baby,
`Cos you know you drive your car
I have you eating your ego ( I don`t think so !! )
I`d make it pocket your pride, Oh no
And just as hard as I`ve been loving you, oh girl, 
Well you know you`d be loving me harder

[Lenny & Skin]
That`s why I ain`t gonna` love you

[Lenny]
Harold, come on

[Lenny & Skin]
That`s why I don`t wanna love you
No I don`t want to love you [X7]
