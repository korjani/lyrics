YOU`RE TOO COOL TO BE SMART, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU`RE TOO HARD TO BE SANE, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU`RE TOO SAD TO BE HIGH, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU DON`T HAVE TO RUN

YOU GOT TO RISE UP, SWEET WOMAN CHILD
YOU GOT TO RISE UP, SWEET WOMAN CHILD
YOU GOT TO RISE UP, SWEET WOMAN CHILD
YOU`RE LOSING YOUR CONVICTIONS

YOU`RE TOO WISE TO BE COOL, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU`RE TOO DEEP TO BE GOOD, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU`RE TOO WEAK TO BE SOLD, BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE
YOU DON`T HAVE TO RUN

YOU`RE LOSING ALL OF YOUR GOOD CONVICTIONS
YOUR INTEGRITY SLOWLY WATERED DOWN
NEVER MIND YOUR SOUL CONVICTIONS
NEVERMIND, NEVERMIND, NEVERMIND IT ALL

OH LORD WHEN YOU FEEL IT IN THE AIR
OH LORD WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANNA CRY
OH LORD WHEN YOU LOVE THE ONE YOU`RE WITH

RISE UP NOW [X4]
