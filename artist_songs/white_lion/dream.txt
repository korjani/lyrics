If you could fly like a bird in the sky
Hide in the clouds from the people below
If you could fly anywhere that you wanted
Tell me where would you go

If you could live like a fish in the ocean
And never knowing the time or the day
If you could be anything that you wanted
Even just for a day

Everyone sits and wonders
What they will never do
Now can you hear the thunder
It's calling you

Dream when your eyes are open
Dream when you're sound asleep
No one can ever stop you dreaming
Dream with your heart is broken
Dream when you've given up
Nothing should ever stop you dreaming

If you could walk on the moon like a spaceman
And look on down at the world from above
If you could travel the endless journey
And go somewhere you love

Open your heart and wonder
All that you're gonna do
Follow the sound of thunder
It's calling you

Dream when your eyes are open
Dream when you're sound asleep
No one can ever stop you dreaming
Dream with your heart is broken
Dream when you've given up
Nothing should ever stop you dreaming

Dream when your eyes are open
Dream when you're sound asleep
No one can ever stop you dreaming
Dream with your heart is broken
Dream when you've given up
Nothing should ever stop you dreaming
