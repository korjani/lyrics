Give me a car show me a road
Let me get out before I'm old
Take me away to somewhere new
Don't wanna stay been here too long
Tired of singing the same ol' song
Time for a change before too late

And I waited for the phone to ring
No check was in the mail
I gave it all my everything
But now I'm gonna bail

I wasted time hanging around
Let all the good ones go
The dreams I sought I never found
And now where did they go
I sacrificed I paid the price
I fought for what was right
And now I come to realize
I finally see the light

Out on my own doing alright
Don't really care where I spend the night
What I know is I'm moving on
Day by day Town to town
You can say I get around
I should have done it long ago

I followed every word you said
But little did I know
That one day you would leave me dead
With nothing much to show

I wasted time hanging around
Let all the good ones go
The dreams I sought I never found
And now where did they go
I sacrificed I paid the price
I fought for what was right
And now I come to realize
I finally see the light

I wasted time hanging around
Let all the good ones go
The dreams I sought I never found
And now where did they go
I sacrificed I paid the price
I fought for what was right
And now I come to realize
I finally see the light
