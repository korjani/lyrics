I got the call one summer night
He said you're on tomorrow's flight
My mother cried my sister too
My father said I'm proud of you
I can't believe it's true
We're going after 'who'
And still I wish that I just knew
What are we fighting for
When the price we pay is endless war
What are we fighting for
When all we need is peace
Though I'm blind to what I see
They tell me there's an enemy
I know I gotta get outta here
Insanity is drawing near
Can't take it anymore
I've knocked on heaven's door
No I'm not dying for this war
What are we fighting for
When the price we pay is endless war
What are we fighting for
When all we need is peace
What are we fighting for
Can't we learn from what we've done before
What are we fighting for
When no one ever wins, in war
A young man returns from war
Where he didn't know
What he was fighting for
The streets remained the same
But people'd changed
The medals on his chest
Didn't mean a thing
A tear dropped from the corner of his eye
Did he come come
My grandpa died in Normandy
My brother is still in Vietnam
I know there's nothing good in war
I know 'cause I've been there before
So what am I gonna do
I know this war ain't through
And still I wish that I just knew
What are we fighting for
When the price we pay is endless war
What are we fighting for
When all we need is peace
What are we fighting for
Can't we learn form what we've done before
What are we fighting for
When no one ever wins, in war
