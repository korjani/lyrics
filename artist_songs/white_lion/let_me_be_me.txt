I never thought I would be king
Doing my best to win
I never felt I would be anything at all
But when I take a look inside
What I see I like
I wouldn't go and change anything at all

If only you could see me for
The person that I am
If only you could open up your mind

Let me be me
There is more than what you see
Let me be me
And you will have the best of me

I never thought I could be right
Or make a stand and fight
I always give up way before I even try
Now when I open up my eyes
It's like a big surprise
I know that I can do anything I want

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't even show me how
I'm gonna do it just the way I know

Let me be me
There is more than what you see
Let me be me
And you will have the best of me

Let me be me
There is more than what you see
Let me be me
And you will have the best of me

Let me be me
There is more than what you see
Let me be me
And you will have the best of me
