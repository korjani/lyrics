Children crying from the heat
Don't they know they belong
People fighting can't compete
Don't they know that they're wrong
Time is standing
Still all around
Yes time takes us on a trip
Round'n'round our minds
Pictures of a dream
All it does is cloud all the lies

So let's all join our hands
Raise them together
We can fight for the lives that are real
Yeah lets all join hands
Raise them together
It's a fight for the right that we feel

Nations plan hearts are weak
Don't they know that we belong
Years of growing reach the peak
Don't they know that they're wrong
Life surrounds us
In many different ways
All we see
Are switches there to take it all away
Pieces of a dream
All it does is cloud all the lies

So let's all join our hands
Raise them together
We can fight for the lives that are real
Yeah lets all join hands
Raise them together
It's a fight for the right that we feel

Is this the way
We treat one another
Days filled with hope
Lives filled with fear
Why must we live
At war with our brothers
When we could live
Our future at last

So let's all join our hands
Raise them together
We can fight for the lives that are real
Yeah lets all join hands
Raise them together
It's a fight for the right that we feel
