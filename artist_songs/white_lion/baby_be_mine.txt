If I crossed a thousand oceans
And rode a million miles
I would still be far away from you
If I climbed the highest mountain
And dove the deepest sea
Then would I find you waiting
There for me

And if only you could hear me
Yeah if you could see me

Baby be mine, baby be mine
Baby be mine, baby be mine

If I wrote a hundred love songs
And they were all for you
Then would you realize my love was true
If I gave you pearls 'n' diamonds
And showered you in vine
Then would there be a chance that you'd
Be mine

Baby be mine, baby be mine
Baby be mine, baby be mine

[Solo]

Baby be mine, baby be mine
Baby be mine, baby be mine
