You say it ain't so and you don't know
But what should I believe
You seem so sad you get so mad
But is it in your mind
You gotta believe
Things they happen for a reason
You gotta hold on
There ain't nothing you can't do

Every time it don't work just throw it out
Every time you wanna waste it you better taste it

Anything you want
Anything you need you got it
Just open your eyes and take a good look inside
Anything you love
Anything you like just grab it
Follow your heart and don't forget to live your life

You always want to be the best at everything you do
But is it fun when you fall down and there's none one there
Don't be afraid
Let the changes come and go
Don't waste your time
Always let your feelings show

So don't hide it anymore
Let them know just who you are
And don't fight it anymore
You always knew it that you could do it

Anything you want
Anything you need you got it
Just open your eyes and take a good look inside
Anything you love
Anything you like just grab it
Follow your heart and don't forget to live your life

When it gets too tough
Don't ever think of quitting
You don't get nowhere by sitting on your ass
Looking down that empty glass
Just wondering what ever you did wrong

Anything you want
Anything you need you got it
Just open your eyes and take a good look inside
Anything you love
Anything you like just grab it
Follow your heart and don't forget to live your life

Anything you want
Anything you need you got it
Just open your eyes and take a good look inside
Anything you love
Anything you like just grab it
Follow your heart and don't forget to live your life
