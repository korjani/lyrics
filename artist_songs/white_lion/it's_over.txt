There's a little note beside this empty bed
I hear the back door slam 'n' baby you're on your way
You know I cried a thousand times before you left
You say that this is it
But baby can't you wait
You take your love and go far away
But I'll be missing your everyday
'Cause it's over
And there's nothing I can do
Yeah it's over
But I'm still in love with you
Over, over, over
But I love you girl
And I want you back again
This house is lonely and cold without you here
I wish the pain inside my heart would disappear
I know that I was wrong to treat you like I did
But don't you think our love deserves a second chance
When all the love is gone from your heart
And everything we had falls apart
Then it's over
And there's nothing I can do
Yeah it's over
But I'm still in love with you
Over, over, over
But I love you girl
And I want you back again
Tears are falling from my eyes as I cry
I only wish that you were here
If only you had told me
If only I had known
Maybe you would still
Be sleeping in my arms
Won't you let me know
Won't you let it show
Now it's over. Etc.
