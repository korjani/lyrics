Your mother slapped you when you were born
[?] for her circumstance
Another letter and you're gone
From the word of time carries on
Oh, no you will not continue that way
Ancient feelings that I wrote
Sitting through your inner self
Do you feel you won't [?]
(till the mindless act your friend performs)
Say no, I won't let this stand in my way
Just look at yourself and see

[Chorus:]
You're the kid of 1000 faces yeah yeah
You're the kid of 1000 faces yeah yeah

Oh, it feels real good
When something's said and understood
Do you feel the awesome sun?
That's why you [?] at the time you leave note
Oh, no Do you [?] my existence away
Just look at yourself and see

[Chorus:]
They tell us that we are wrong
But (what's that) about you and me
Are we too wild? Are we too young?
Hey listen man, we don't give a damn
Just look at yourself and see
Just look at yourself
Just look at yourself

[Chorus x2]

Run, nah, nah, nah,
