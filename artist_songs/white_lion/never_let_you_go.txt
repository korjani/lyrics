When the bed is cold as ice
And tears are falling from your eyes
Afraid to make a move
But dying to be touched
When the night is getting long
And we are blind to what is wrong
If only you could see
With you I want to be

When the questions in your head they are killing you
Just remember what I said and promised you promised you

I know I know
I won't ever let you go
And I will love you everyday
And I hope I pray
There won't ever come a day
When we will say goodbye
Cause love can never die

There are times when nothing works
And all you do just getting worse
In your mind you've given up
But waiting to be found
When your hope is gone and lost
And you don't know who you should trust
You're crying out for help
You try to carry on

When the time is running out and it's the end
Just remember what I said and I promised you promised you

I know I know
I won't ever let you go
And I will love you everyday
And I hope I pray
There won't ever come a day
When we will say goodbye
Cause love can never die

I know I know
I won't ever let you go
And I will love you everyday
And I hope I pray
There won't ever come a day
When we will say goodbye
Cause love can never die
