I got a used leather jacket and an old pair of boots
With holes in the soles
And my 501 blues have seen better of days
Now I don't have a place that'll keep me warm
And I can call my own
When you ain't got any money you can't pay no rent
And you're out

I'm gonna be all right

So I pack my bags and ride into the sunset
I don't know where I'm gonna go but
That don't matter at all

I got a college degree that means nothing to me
And I ain't got a job
Cause I don't want anybody telling me what to do
I got bad reputation and a story to match
So leave me alone
The wind at my heels and the sound of my wheels keep me going

Yes I'm gonna be all right

So I pack my bags and ride into the sunset
I don't know where I'm gonna go but that don't matter at all
I'm gonna do it my way and I don't change for no one
Yeah I'm living on the edge and I got nothing to lose

So I keep my motor running
All through this endless summer night
And there's no one who can touch me
It's only me and my wheels

[Solo]

So I pack my bags and ride into
The sunset
I don't know where I'm gonna go but
That don't matter at all
I'm gonna do it my way and I don't
Change for no one
Cause I'm living on the edge and I got
Nothing to lose

So I pack my bags and ride into
The sunset
I don't know where I'm gonna go but
That don't matter at all
I'm gonna do it my way and I don't
Change for no one
Cause I'm living on the edge and I got
Nothing to lose
