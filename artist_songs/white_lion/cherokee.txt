You were wild and you were free
You would search your destiny
But the white man came and took your land away
You were fire and you were flame
You were blood inside that (vein)
How he brought you fame the day he came to stay

I hear you howling through the night
The wind is cold the moons are fading
The pride and sorrow curse the light
And wakes a vengeance in your heart

You were young but you were wise
You were smoke that always raised
How they put you down and spit upon your name
You were snow and you were rain
You would walk without a shame
But they changed your life and gave you all the blame

The sound of thunder breaks the arch
10000 riders side by side
The time has come to end the fight
For their freedom, for their right

[Chorus:]
Cherokee, riding free
You ride into the sky
Where your spirit lives forever
Cherokee, riding free
You ride into the sky
Where all your freedom lasts forever

The fire burns tonight
We all recall the fight
Where blood was shed without a reason
200 years have passed since you stood ashore
And raped your land down to the core

[Chorus]
