You say goodbye, cause you can't take no more
I guess I've seen you cry a thousand times before

And if you want to break it up, just go ahead
But tell me why, you're running out the door

And baby if you go
There's one thing you should know
That all our love must die
Before you say goodbye

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Cause when you run away
There ain't no comin' back

I've always tried to keep you satisfied
And I've never lied or tried to cheat on you

But but it don't matter what I've done for you
Cause you don't know just what you wanna do

We can't go on this way
Living day by day
I don't know what to do
I guess it's up to you

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Cause when you run away
There ain't no comin' back

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Cause when you run away
There ain't no comin' back

[Solo]

You told me, you'd never leave me behind
You sold out, you gave up
The love that we'd found

Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Cause when you run away
There ain't no comin' back

Don't say it's over
