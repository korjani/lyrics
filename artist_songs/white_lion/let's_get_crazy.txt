We've been workin' hard all week
We've been under command
We've been trapped in this prison cell
I think it's time to get out

And now it's Friday 5 o'clock
We know it's time to rock
So leave all your worries behind
And switch into overdrive

Let's get crazy, let's get wild
Let's get crazy, let's get wild

We'll tear the town up and burn it down
We'll break every rule around
We'll show no mercy for the old and weak
Yeah the boys are back in town

Cause when Monday morning comes
We will be back on our job
So give it all you got tonight
And party 'till morning light

Let's get crazy, let's get wild
Let's get crazy, let's get wild

[Solo]

And now it's Friday 5 o'clock
We know it's time to rock
So leave all your worries behind
And switch into overdrive

Let's get crazy, let's get wild
Let's get crazy, let's get wild
