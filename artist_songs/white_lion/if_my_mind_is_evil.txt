Holy man on television, read up from the book
50 million people watching everywhere you look
When you speak of all the sins that every man has done
I wonder where you're goin' when the show is done

Lock your door - feeling hungry
Want some more - got to taste it

But if my mind is evil then lock me up below
And burn my thoughts to ashes till I won't know

You tell me what I should do, you want to take control
You try to reach me inside,and change the way I think
It seems to me you want to rule all over me
Why don't you practice what you preach and let me be

Go away - let me be
I don't need you - stay away

But if my mind is evil then lock me up below
And burn my thoughts to ashes till I won't know
But if your mind is evil then maybe you should go
And save us from your cryin' 'cause we all know

[Solo]

Yeah... if my mind is evil then lock me up below
And burn my thoughts to ashes till I won't know
But if your mind is evil then maybe you should go
And save us from your cryin' 'cause we all know

Yeah if my mind is evil then lock me up below
And burn my thoughts to ashes till I won't know

Am I evil , yes I am
