Baby, baby look so fine
Let me know that you'll be mine
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
Pick me up and take me home
Let your love be all I own
Just be my baby through the night
Baby take off your leather
And show me all your lace
Gimme loving one thousand ways

Cause I'm hungry
Yes, I'm hungry
Oh so hungry
Hungry for your love

Keep your engine running high
When you take my love inside
But hold the trigger on my loaded gun
Show me that your touch is right
And take to the top tonight
Hurt me baby but don't let me cry
Cause your touching gets me crazy
And your teasing drives me wild
I need your love like a little child

Cause I'm hungry
Yes I'm hungry
Oh so hungry for your love

Cause your love is wild
I'm begging like a child
Needing all of you
When your love is mine
I'll be feeling fine
All through the night

Keep your engine running high
When you take my love inside
But hold the trigger on my loaded gun
Baby take off your leather
And show me all your lace
Gimme love one thousand ways

Cause I'm hungry...
