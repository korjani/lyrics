Early in the morning on a bright December day
I was taken from my home and many miles away
Twenty years would pass on by and I'd become a man
Living as a prisoner in a foreign land

Memories something from the past
Dreams that come but never last
Where am I now
Will I ever know
Will they ever let me go

Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me
Set me free and let me go
I don't know what I've done
In my cell I dream of freedom
Set me free and let me go

Foreign faces I don't know will never be my friend
I have been here for too long when will this ever end
Take me here take me there I don't understand
Will you find the things you seek in this broken man

Where is home, can I find my way
Will they still remember me
What am I now
Will I ever know
Everything from long ago

Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me
Set me free and let me go
I don't know what I've done
In my cell I dream of freedom
Set me free and let me go

Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me
Set me free and let me go
I don't know what I've done
In my cell I dream of freedom
Set me free and let me go
