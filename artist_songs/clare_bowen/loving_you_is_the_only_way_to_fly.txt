I should have moved on long ago
Why I still want you I don't know
These days my best laid plans
Are built on shifting sands
It's not like I don't know you said goodbye

Loving you is the only way to fly

Can't find the strength to stand alone
Can't seem to find my way back home
I fell so far so deep
Can't eat, can't breath, can't sleep
Don,t much care if I live or die

Loving you is the only way
Loving you is the only way to fly (loving you is the only way to fly)
Somebody said, "Some dreams come true, some pass you by."
That's how it is

Sometimes I pray you'll come around
We'll find a house somewhere in town
I keep my hopes alive
With one long free-fall dive
I think, drink, sink into this lie

Loving you is the only way
Loving you is the only way (loving you is the only way to fly)
Somebody said, "Some dreams come true, some pass you by."
