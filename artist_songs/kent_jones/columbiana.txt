My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know
My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know
My Metro blowin' up, my Metro blowin'
My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know

Columbiana, Columbiana
Made her way to South Toronto
My baby 'bout to break the scales
She done spread it all over town
Carol City to Chicago now

(Yeah, hola) Hola mamacita
I'm so glad to meet you
Yeah, I heard she like that white on white
She movin' bass like Barry White
Hola mamacita
I'm so glad to meet you
Yeah, I heard she like that white on white
She stick to me like white on rice

Yeah, she started in a Kia
She used to live like three doors down
Told her "Hit me when you free up"
She said "I'm out on Costa Rica now"
I hit her on the Metro
I said "Don't take the Metro home
I'm on my way to get you
Stay by my side, stay by your phone"

Yeah, I think her name was Kia
She asked where can we meet up now
God damn she's so proud though
Guess that's the reason why I keep her 'round
And I ain't being petty
Chicago with me, keep that Manny and that Pedi
I'm in Seattle with my manos
Flew into London now they [?]
