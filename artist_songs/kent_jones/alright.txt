I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

She make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It's alright, alright
Win or lose, take her for jewels
It's alright, alright
I said don't lose yourself
In that mud, cause it get rainy all the time
She on that pole forever
So right now, it's too many singles on the ground (yeah!)

She said I'm a freak
But I'm not promiscuous
I like shit discreet
She ain't know what the difference was
Said she wanna come back just to smoke and chill with us
I told her get a taxi, I hopped up in my sprinter bus
She pullin' up in the Maybach and I asked how much the rental was
Dinner date with her man, I still asked how much dinner was
Beehive outside the fucking studio
I told Smitty don't knock it down, bitch don't kill my buzz

I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

She make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It's alright, alright
Win or lose, take her for jewels
It's alright, alright
I said don't lose yourself
In that mud, cause it get rainy all the time
She on that pole forever
So right now, it's too many singles on the ground (yeah!)

Don't hate the playa
Girl, just hate the game
My stomach turned, it had too much to drank
I hit Golden Krust
Cause I was feeling urghy
If Shaun wasn't Livingston, would they sell curry?
Tell the driver be here 12:30
Call Nessa cause I can't go with my nails dirty
She askin' too many questions 'bout who my exes is
So I kindly got up showed her where the exit is

I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

She make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It's alright, alright, alright
Win or lose, take her for jewels
