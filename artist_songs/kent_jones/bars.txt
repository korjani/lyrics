I guess I understand why being satisfied doesn't always promise satisfaction,
The happy girls to me are mad attractive,
The ones that play it aggressive here are just not as passive,
The ones that talk about sex the most really not as active,
The others orgasm with passion but show no compassion,
I had delivery before contraction, you know delivery with no contractions,
While I'm birthing a new sound, you busy trying to match it,
I like my females like my emails, no attachments.
I'm the one these niggas fear when it's all said and done,
I hear it all if it was said in ones,
You telling people I know about how you feel about me,
The way you hate, they wouldn't believe you only met me once,
Hate my attitude and tell me why you still around me, 
Cos if you able to tell me what someone else says then how come they still comfortable talking about me around family,
I swear some of the quite ones really the loudest,
Rather keep it real then to just scream it and shout it,
Fake is fake, Great Wall of China there's no way around it,
A lot of my doubters hate but now all they the proudest,
I'm as old as your child is but to me you just childish,
I guess that PR is just another word for your stylist,
Boy you clever boy, I know you clever,
They hating on me cos they all know I could go forever,
I read you niggas before you fold, open letter.

Strong opinions and no resume to back it up don't go together,
Your shit sound like broken records, never broke a record,
Told you long ago who I was and what it was I'm here to do, 
I guess you ain't believe me,
And you can smile all day 
But trying to talk me out my gut feeling is not as easy,
I learnt that publicists have a hard time learning to have a personal life, 
Oh oh, I know somebody took that personal right?
I ain't got no time to focus on the shit you do wrong, 
I don't go back and forth, I got too many verses to write
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Sir please leave him alone,
Why can't you just focus on one song?
I only short talk because my verses are so long,
Play fair, play fair, guess it's scary still 
Ya'll contracts DD in store pickles, you share a deal.

Too many rugrats trying to appear on the surface,
I ain't accidentally dope it's clear we here with a purpose,
Going off like its 06 and I'm bout to make the city blow,
Coolen, Drake, Khaled and Rossie started here with Joe,
It's my destination if you ever see me reaching,
Hip hop restoration if you ever see me preaching,
His family told him he should be a deacon heathen, 
Bless the nations of the hip hop heathers,
Turned all the breaking points into points they can't prove,
Same nigga in class they saw as a lame dude,
Could walk into a McDonald's cos I'm best friends with the owner,
Found out he and the employees attended the same school.
