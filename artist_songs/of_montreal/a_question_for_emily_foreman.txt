Emily do you think it's safe to guess
that you'll be different from the rest
Emily I don't know if you're truly make believe
but my mind is open to you anyhow
Oh someday I will say the following words to you
Emily you're very different from the rest
you have me really quite impressed
Emily I don't know if you're truly someone's dream
but my mind is open to you now

Now Emily brings a tray of parfait
to the troops of sinuous felines
lounging in her chaise longue
Now Emily with an ardent oratory
inspires the troops of sinuous felines
to do the bidding of

Emily you know I'd love to know you best
but are your confessions just in jest?
Emily I hope that you are truly what you seem
cause my heart is open to you
