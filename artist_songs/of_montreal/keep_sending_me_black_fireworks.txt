Look in my eyes what do you see?
I'm hanging upside down like a chimpanzee
When I'm with my friends riding somewhere on a crowded bus
There is nothing that I want to discuss
I just sit and smile thinking about us

What is this that sends black fireworks dancing around me?
When we kiss the explosiveness is life's sweet mystery

I feel like a balloon floating higher I'm touching a distant moon
I don't think I'll come down anytime soon
Ah my kitten I am so glad you're the way you are
You're my favorite living human by far
'cause you make this frightening world less bizarre

What is this that sends black fireworks dancing around me?
When we kiss the explosiveness is life's sweet mystery
