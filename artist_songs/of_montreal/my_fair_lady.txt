My lady's back at home
Cutting myself and sending me photographs
My lady's back at home
Cutting myself and sending me photographs

She was a friend to me
She was a friend

Back at home
Dismantling our love at the request of other people
Back at home
Dismantling our love, killing it to please other people

She was a friend to me
She was a friend
She was a friend to me

Because you've been so damaged,
I have to give all the love that was meant for you to somebody else
Because you've been so abused,
I have to give all the love that was meant for you to some other girl

She, she caught calamities
I'm embarrassed to admit, it's traumatized me
I'm ashamed to admit, your mind has traumatized me

You were a friend
You were a friend
You were a friend to me

Because you've been so damaged,
I have to give all the love that was meant for you to somebody else
Because you've been so abused,
I have to give all the love that was meant for you to some other girl

Oh won't you come around?
Won't you change?
Not for me, but for you, for yourself
Oh can't you?
(Can't you change?)

Can't you change?
Can't you change?
Can't you change?
Can't you change?
Can't you change?
