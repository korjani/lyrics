When we're all in a crowd
And you catch her eye
And then you both smile
I feel so good inside
And when I'm with her
She talks about you
The things that you say
The things that you do

It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love

They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find

She takes your hand
When the world stays outside
That's something to see
That's nothing to hide

And when I feel bad
When people disappoint me
That's when I need you two
To help me believe

It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love

They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find

It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love 

They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find
