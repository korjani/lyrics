We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

Georgie said romantic love is flat
(Georgie said that)
Only for people with no real ambition in their life
(No life)
But oh, but List Christie disagrees
She sees into the core of my poor machine
(I'll tell you what she sees)
Frightened cornered Gemini tactics and
Attempts to crack the party code
And there's one more thing

We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

Our bodies became one and then we so really turned on
Became a freaky permutation
Something like Voltron
Then I was wrapped in discourse with the magazine reader
The mutual conclusion was I'm not worth knowing because I'm probably dead
So I'm exposed but no solution

Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala

We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

Oh
Lalala lalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
