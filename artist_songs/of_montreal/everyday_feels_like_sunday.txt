Everyday feels like Sunday baby everyday feels so good
Everyday feels like Sunday baby everyday feels so good
I'm further and further away from the fall everyday

And for years I bowed I could not sleep so very well
Even standing up I crawled yet there is a softness I can tell

I'm electric now from the pure brilliant sparks you shot
Like a little man all I can say is "thanks a lot"

Ah I must destroy this artificial darkness
That's how it seems to me to be, art artificial now 'cause
