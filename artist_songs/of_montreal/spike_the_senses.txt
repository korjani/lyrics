Every second of every minute of the day 
I let my fancy play
And when the feeling strikes me
I deliquesce in the sky without waving goodbye
While contemplating (ooohhhooohhhooohhh)
A fractured pale cathedral wall
Death can't touch me at all
Let its rapacious fingers with venomous stingers try
I'd like to see them try

Try to find a way to spike the senses
Til everything goes white [x3]
Try to find a way to spike the senses

I had a vision of vinyl spiders in a cage
now I avoid the stage
'Cause though it was a trifle 
I still can't stifle the fear 
That they might just reappear

Try to find a way to spike the senses
Til everything goes white [x3]
Try to find a way to spike the senses

Climbing climbing climbing never falling
If it was up to me I'd freak the clouds
Let them fall and drip to the sea
I think the chemicals have done
Some evil thing to me
