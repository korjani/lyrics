You're my muse you're my silly goose 
and every day is a dreamy day of daydreaming of you. 
You're my one you're my honey bun 
and every day is a dreamy day of daydreaming of you. 

I can dream of you without snoring and I'm lucky that that's true. 
Because everyone would know that I found them boring simply because they're not you.
All I want to do is lay in the daisies and daydream of you know who I'm referring to...you. 

You're my love you're my star above 
And everyday is a dreamy day of daydreaming of you
