I have given all myself
All that I had left to give
All the reasons I confront
No more reason left to live
If that ain't enough, oh, no, no
Tell me why it's not enough

Even when you let me down
I forgive you in the end
What goes round comes back around
So I'll wait for you till then
If that's not enough, oh, no, no
Tell me what would be enough, be enough, be enough, be enough

[Pre-Chorus:]
And what is love
If you're still searching for something?
And what is love
If it's building up to nothing?
We'll never see how far we've come
But we keep looking at the sun
So what is love
If we're still searching for something?

[Chorus:]
Get higher, higher, higher
We keep looking up
Higher, higher, higher
But we're still not high enough
Higher, higher, higher
We keep looking up
Higher, higher, higher
But we're still not high enough

Take my heart back from your hands
And my pride back from your sheets
I'll believe while I still can
Taking back the best of me
If this ain't enough, no, no, no
Then I guess I've had enough, had enough, had enough, had enough

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
