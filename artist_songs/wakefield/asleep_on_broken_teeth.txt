If you didn't want me to know
You sure didn't try to hide it
If you didn't think I would change
I hate white teeth lying
You slipped up, I hate to do this
My friends warned me, they saw right through it
Evidence is a bitch

Would you make me run for my life?
Would you make me run? 

A mouth full of hate, ready to go
You better keep your rib cage unexposed
Cause I might have to hurt you
Evidence is a bitch
And I could never do that

Would you make me run for my life?
Would you make me run?
And how do you sleep late at night?
Would you make me run?

Would you make me run for my life?
Would you make me run?
(And I could never do that)
Just say that we are and I
Would you make me run?
