Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey

I can make a dope fiend of you yet if I could find ya
I just like a freak ho for the nostalgia
No my heart can't break no more
I can't even feel the paper cuts
Let me see my son and let me ball, let me ball yeah
Measure twice, cut once, fucked up
On that other night and the kids got me high enough
To touch the rim
As the kid that's the only thing I wanted then
Yeah I feel like Mikey D
Lord I guess I gotta take my words back
Merge with me Henny light hurt
I got 25 plus a few
This might be the zip
Or the shit or another clue
I got what you need
What you don't, what you never knew

Yeah skin and bones you are my favorite type
Yeah, oh skin and bones you are my favorite type, haha

You, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it
You, you my favorite topic
You, money, fuckin' love it
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Money, fuckin' love it
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin'

I guess we back to talkin' shit again, very riveting
Do you love me for the benefits? Finish this
Told me what you need, what you like, what you never did
Tell me on your knees, say it right, fix your upper lip
You just head boppin' cause I said bop it
You like jean Robins with them bean poppers
And them lean stockers
That don't mean shit
But they cool when you need somethin'
Always need somethin'
More fees, more of these suckers
I'm a tree hugger
Caught a peep 'fore I eat somethin'
Keep your fees covered, play it safe
Fuck with me puppet
That was me truckin' overseas
Cool as Al Bundy
For the slouch of 'em
In the house and my cows comin' home

Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it
Yeah, you my favorite topic
Yeah, money, fuckin' love it
You my, you my favorite
You my favorite, you my [?]
