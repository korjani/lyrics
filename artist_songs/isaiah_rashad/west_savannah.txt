[Hook]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic banging through the night
(Fall in love, through the night)
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living do or die
(Type of way, do or die)
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
(Push me, to the side)
At least, we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide
(At least, we fell in love)

[Bridge]
How you feeling baby?
How you feeling baby?
I travel... for you
I battle... for you
Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel... for you

[Verse]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic banging through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living do or die
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
At least, we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide

[Hook]
