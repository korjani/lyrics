[Isaiah Rashad:]
Bum, bum, bum, ba, bum
Yeah feel me
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Oh, believe I feel great  today
I can't help but just pour my drink
Cause they keep talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, ha
I swear

Baby, nigga I'm faded
Nigga I feel like 25 baby
Skunk, drunk, lookin' like a robber
Headed to the church or headed to the brothel
Poppin' my collar, really like Deebo
How do you tell the truth to a crowd of white people?
Made it, motivational speaker, bumpin'
Most time tellin' my teacher somethin'

Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin' was a habit
Trappin' was a habit, shooter got a reason
Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll change my mind

[Isaiah Rashad, Deacon Blue:]
Oh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank
Cause sometimes they be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, uh, uh, yeah
Outside niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon
Outside niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon

Jesus always told me I was special
Mommy told me go and get some money
Spread shit to the world
Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have some
Have mine, nigga heaven ain't free
We was just prayin' for another drink
Bitch look good to a buzzard, hey
I could barely hear from the thunder, wait
I could barely feel for the money, wait

Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin'  was a habit
Trappin' was a habit, shooter got a reason
Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll ease my mind

Oh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank
Cause sometimes they be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah, sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, yeah, ha
Outside niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon
Outside niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon

Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce now I'm shootin' where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
