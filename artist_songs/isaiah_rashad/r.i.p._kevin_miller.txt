[Chorus 4X:]
Y'all live for bitches and blunts, we live for weed and money
Y'all live for bitches and blunts, we live for weed and money (WAKE UP~!)

Alright, now if I die today, bitch my legacy is straight
I'm the best they never heard, I'm your brother, just relate
I need diamond teeth, livin' like it's 1998
Like when Percy was the king, back when Juvie was the great
Bitch this doobie is the bait, Patton taught me how to pimp
Like one day you here, then gone, that's why Chad was downin' shrimp
I've been ridin' out, since I thought my Huffy was the shit
Chattanooga pool of sharks, don't you slip and lose a limb
Slow it down, we losin' 'em, I've been on the booze again
Shit, that SOPA a livin' Hell, free Guwop if he in jail
Nigga taught me 'bout the scale, it was vivid, I was there
I was on my first offense, I hope they gon' give me bail
Screamin' "mothafuck a 12, bitches ain't shit!"
Cops ain't neither, they huntin' my people
Codeine I'm back, leanin', I cope with my demons
The best is not perfect, the rest is not worth it - WAKE UP~!

[Chorus]

Hey bitch I'm back, quit the whinin', bring it back, oochie wally
This the set, it's that mothafuckin' bet, who designed it?
This the one, how you make it out of Chat, who can fly ya?
I'm the prince, it was written in the book, Jeremiah
I got dreams, I got bitches, I got hooks, you can buy 'em
Fresh and clean, that Stankonia had me hooked as a child
Used to think my ambition was a scheme, I defy 'em
You can too, if you get up off your ass, fuckin' try it
I'm a snipe, I'm just tryna make the top fall off
On the whip, like a cannon, lollipop on y'all
Xanny ho get me high, make me feel so tall
I'm tryna keep my mental ground and so I feel for y'all
I swear my eyes be bloody red, but bitch I feel amazin'
And this is not a confrontation, that's an understatement
See this is runnin' in your house and where your momma stayin'
You spendin' doja on some pussy, you ain't concentratin' - just WAKE UP~!

[Chorus]
