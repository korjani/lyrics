[Ryan:]
Smoking by the Hunna Tree
Talking, how it used to be
What we were told was just a dream
By all of them

But I'm sure they see
What I can see cause I can see that

You & me
We are wild and we are free
You & me
We were meant to be

Underneath the fallen leaves
Not just a band, a family
That they can't take away from me
That they can't take away

You & me
We are wild and we are free
You & me
We were meant to be

You & me
Smoking by the Hunna Tree
You & me
We were meant to be

The people sing
They're listening
And they'll believe
What we could be

And I'm sure they see
What I can see, cause I can see that
I'm sure they see
What I can see, cause I can see that

You & me
We are wild and we are free
You & me
We were meant to be

And you & me
Smoking by the Hunna Tree
You & me
We were meant to be

You, me
Smoking by the Hunna Tree
You, me
We were meant to be
