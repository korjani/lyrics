[Ryan:]
And if you love me then why won't you use me?
If you hate me then why do you care?
You said that we would go the distance
Now you don't take me anywhere
I bite my tongue, but fuck your heart
I can't stand, I can't stand you, baby

We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home
We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home

And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire

And you say you want to be alone
Outside the place that we call home
When you come at me with that face
I don't know what to say

We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home
We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home

And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And nothing's gonna feel the same
'Cause our love is going up in flames
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire

So let's burn this to ashes
And go our own way
So pass me the matches
And we'll both watch the flames

(Burn) So let's burn this to ashes
(Burn) And go our own way
(Burn) So pass me the matches
And we'll both watch the flames

And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And nothing's gonna feel the same

And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And nothing's gonna feel the same
'Cause our love is going up in flames
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
