All day
All night
I've been thinkin why feelin' wrong feels so right
And I know
Yeah I try
To turn myself around but I know what I like

I ain't nice
No I'm quite a dick
I'm the bad guy who's makin' you sick
It's easy for me
I've got no shame
I'm in it for the money and fame

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

There's days when I wanna give in
But it's hard to be a saint when you're full of sin
Why would I ever think of goin' back
When it feels so fuckin' good to be bad

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

I know that secretly
Everybody's rootin' for me

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Because the villain is here to stay

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

And I'm here to stay

I'm the villain

And the villain always wins when the hero's away
