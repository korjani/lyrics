Please can I go home now, I can barely stay awake
But you sit there with your pride and kill us all.
You have so much fun now trying to bend me till I break
And I just set myself up to take the fall.
Your eyes are black as tar and to look at you is hard
But I'm just too afraid to look away.
Misery loves company and here you stand in front of me.
Just please don't ask me to stay

So, who do you trust? 
Now that you need me to get through the day
I'm asking too much.
To have you hear what I have to say
So I say

Help me help you, I'm down on my knees
If you need me so much then why did you leave
You needed a reason, you needed too much.
You can lean on me, but don't lean
On me like I'm your crutch.

You never started loving me so you could never quit
I could rule this fuckin world and you'd still think I'm shit
You've turned your back on me, have no family
In the end the devil gets what he deserves

So, who do you trust now that you
Need me to get through the day? 
I'm asking too much, 
To have you hear what I have to say

So I say

Help me help you, I'm down on my knees
If you need me so much then why did you leave
You needed a reason, you needed too much.
You can lean on me, but don't lean
On me like I'm your crutch.

Please help me. please help me
Please help me. please help me

So, who do you trust now that you
Need me to get through the day? 
I'm asking too much, 
To have you hear what I have to say

So I say

Help me help you, I'm down on my knees
If you need me so much then why did you leave
You needed a reason, you needed too much.
You can lean on me, but don't lean
On me like I'm your crutch.

Don't lean on me like I'm your crutch
