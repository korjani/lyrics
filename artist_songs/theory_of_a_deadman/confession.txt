Felt like the earth was alive
Felt like a life worth living
Too bad that knife in my back was so heavy
And now the bitch is gone, but still the knife remains
So glad she's packed and gone already

Well it's like...
Life after death is life after you
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Is gonna have to do

This time the cohice was mine
This time I just won't give in
Too bad that knife in my back was so heavy
And now the picture's gone, but still the dust remains
I hope she's missing me already

Well it's like...
Life after death is life after you
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Life after this is life after you
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Is gonna have to do

Well it's like...
Life after death is life after you
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Life after this is life after you
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Is gonna have to do
Half of all of this is gonna have to do
Is gonna have to do
I hope she's missing me already
