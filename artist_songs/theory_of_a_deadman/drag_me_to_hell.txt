Remember those good times we had
I thought you were my friend
What I felt to be a dream
Just a nightmare in the end
I trusted you, you trusted me
Nothing could go wrong
Until I finally figured out
You were evil all along

What I'd give to see you gone
I never felt this way before
I'd love to see that face you make
When I walk out the door

'cause God can't save you from all your sins
When you threw your life away you let the devil in
Now I can't save you, I know you too well
Like everyone and everything you drag, you drag me to hell

Drag me
Drag me
Drag me

Trapped inside these prison walls
With no way to escape
What I felt to be my life
Was just a big mistake
I thought of you, I thought it through
Everything was clear
The only way from this cage
Was for you to disappear

What I'd give to see you gone
I'm sure you've heard this all before
I'd love to see that face you make
When I walk out the door

'cause God can't save you from all your sins
When you threw your life away you let the devil in
Now I can't save you, I know you too well
Like everyone and everything you drag me, you drag me to hell

Drag me
Drag me
Drag me
You drag me to hell

I hope you had fun
Now that we're done
It's over this time
I'm on to your lies
Get it through your head
Our love is dead
I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you anymore

'cause God can't save you from all your sins
When you threw your life away you let the devil in
No, I can't save you, I know you too well
Like everyone and everything you drag me, you drag me to hell

Drag me
Drag me
Drag me
You drag me to hell

Drag me
Drag me
Drag me
You drag me to hell

Drag me
Drag me
Drag me
You drag me to hell
