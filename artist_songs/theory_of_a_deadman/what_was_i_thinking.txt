I feel so dirty in my hotel room
I got a king size bed that smells like cheap perfume
And I say to myself: Tyler what were you thinking?
(Tyler what were you thinking)
My head is heavy from all the drinks last night
I had too, too many Jagers, I don't feel so right
Am I crazy as hell or is the whole place spinning?
Oh, I've just made a big mistake
I'm caught in a nightmare wide awake

I've got girls outside my window
And girls outside my door
I'm gonna learn, that's too damn easy
And I can't take it anymore
I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

I'm feeling guilty for all the things I've done
I've got a stomach full of knots and my poor heart is numb
Can I live with myself or will I get what's coming
I say I'm sorry and that there's nothing to feel
But it all went to hell without you here
And I'm hating myself so I guess I'll keep drinking
So please just stay, forget this day
Cause you can't be the one that got away

I got whiskey on the table
And whiskey on the floor
I've got fans who will forgive me
Banging on the tour bus door
And I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

What was I thinking [x3]
When all I really want is you

Please, please come and save my soul tonight
Please, please come and make everything alright

I've got girls outside my window
And girls outside my door
I've got girls just dying to take the clothes off
And I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

What was I thinking [x3]
When all I really want is you
What was I thinking [x3]
When all I really want is you

Tyler what were you thinking?
