If I could just be anywhere else you know
I would be anywhere else than here
If I could just be anyone else right now
I would be anyone else but me
With you I just can't hide
You always seem to get right back inside
I just wanna go back home
But now it's gone
You're trapped here all alone
I tell myself this can't be happening again

It'd be careless of me to care about you
Since you don't care about me at all
You got me thinking about how much I've weakened
You got me thinking it's all my fault
And in the end, it'd be careless to love you again

Staring right into the face of fear
Hard to look away when it's right in the mirror
How can you ever trust a liar
When you wake up in bed and the lie is beside you
I told myself this won't be happening again

It'd be careless of me to care about you
Since you don't care about me at all
You got me thinking about how much I've weakened
You got me thinking it's all my fault
You can blame me, I can blame you
Between love and hate we're gonna have to choose
In the end, it'd be careless to love you again

No excuses
I must do this
No excuses

It'd be careless of me to care about you
Since you don't care about me at all
You got me thinking about how much I've weakened
You got me thinking it's all my fault
You can blame me, I can blame you
Between love and hate we're gonna have to choose
In the end, it'd be careless to love you again
It'd be careless to love you again
It'd be careless to love you again
In the end...
