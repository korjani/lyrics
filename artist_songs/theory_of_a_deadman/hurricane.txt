I should have known these walls would cave in
I should have never left my heart there on the line
Cause when the shit hit the fan
All we ever had ended up lost in the fire
And now nothing's saved, nothing's gained
Was it all in vain?
Cause I'm standing in the eye of the storm
And everything I've known is blowin' away (blowin' away)

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

Remember how we were, we really were
Before this disaster came and tore us apart
It was the two of us, that was enough
The two of us, so in love
Til the window of lies,
The rain of cries and lightning strikes
And now we're standing in the eye of the storm
And everything is gone, nothing remains (I'm blowing away)

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

I never thought it would end
You'll never understand
How we let it end
Like this

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

Hurt
Oh, hurricane
Hurt
Oh, hurricane
