If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Well then I've got a story to tell,
If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Then I guess you're going straight to hell!

Don't wanna leave you now or never,
Cause we're perfect together,
Never wanna be apart,
Dared to take on the simple life.

There was trouble for us when I came home early,
Never would expect to see this,
It's fair to say I could not believe my eyes,
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say,
So I made a list of how you're going to pay!

[Chorus:]
I Locked you out,
Left you naked in the front yard,
Burned all of your clothes,
Having nothing can be really hard,
Now I'm on the run,
I'd do it all again,
So Catch me if you can,
Cause, I took your car,
With your baby in the back seat,
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat,
Baby now you know how much it hurts,
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a Little Smirk!

Now I feel better,
But its hard to forget,
I never think of looking back,
Cause time has no meaning when your free,
This is what you get,
Karma bitch,
Now I see who you really are,
Cause happiness is the best revenge,
But caught red handed with a grin on your face,
Didn't think you'd be easy to replace!

[Chorus]

Again and again and again and again and e-yeah....

If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Well then I've got a story to tell,
If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Then I know I'm going straight to hell!

[Chorus]

Wearing nothing but a Little Smirk!
