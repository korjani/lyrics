That evil woman with the wicked smile
She just knocked me on my ass
She says I ain't the fool that you fall for
Oh why did I even ask?
Just when I think she's said it all
She saved the best for last
She rolls her eyes with a smile
Swears she's never coming back

Stop runnin' away from me
Cuz you only have yourself to blame for everything
So stop runnin' away for a change
Cuz I know if I don't try to stop you now
You'll just go and do it again

Oh I think she's had enough
She just put me in the past
She holds her head up high
Says I would never last
That lady loves to lead me on
And she's done her job so well
Yeah, she saved the best for last
Made my life a livin' hell

Stop runnin' away from me
Cuz you only have yourself to blame for everything
So stop runnin' away for a change
Cuz I know if I don't try to stop you know
You'll just go and do it again

Stop runnin' away from me
Cuz you only have yourself to blame for everything
Stop runnin' away for a change
Cuz I know if I don't try to stop you now
You'll just do it again
Just do it again

Stop runnin' away from me
Cuz you only have yourself to blame for everything
Stop runnin' away for a change
Cuz I know if I don't try to stop you now
You'll just go and do it again
