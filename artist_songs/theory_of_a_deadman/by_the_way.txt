A note by the door
Simply explains
It's all that remains
It's no wonder why
I have not slept in days
The dust on the floor
Piled up from the years
All those scars and souvenirs
Now that you're gone
It's easy to see
But so hard to believe

By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is
You and me
You and me

It's not like before
You left nothing here
It's all disappeared
It hurts me to see
That we've been a lie
Would it have hurt you to try?

By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away

All I can think about is
You and me
You and me

It's sad to say that
This pain is killing me inside
But it's time to say
That this pain is keeping me alive
Twisting and turning
It rips through my heart
It's been tearing me apart

By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is
You and me
You and me

All i think about now
Is you and me
You and me
All i think about now
Is you and me
You and me

By the way
By the way
By the way
