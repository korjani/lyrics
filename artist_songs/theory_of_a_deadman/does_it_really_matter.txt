They don't seem to know your name
Does it really matter?
They don't even shed a tear, for you
They didn't seem to waste no time
To fill your locker
They don't give a second thought, to you
Oh, things have gotta change

I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
Now you're gone

You're spending all your time alone
Cause you don't need them
No one can see the pain inside, of you
You just wanna say goodbye
You're giving up now
I think the letter says it all, it's not your fault
Oh, things will never change

I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?

Did it hurt as much that day
As every other?
So I light a candle in, your name

I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?

It's hard to say but now you're gone
To me it really matters

Does it really matter?
