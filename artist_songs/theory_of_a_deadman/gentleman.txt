I let the door, Hit you right in the face,
And when the cheque comes I'll make you pay.
Don't Have a car, Guess you're picking me up,
And in the back seat we'll be falling in love.
My only job is... to lie on this couch,
And while you're workin' I'll be hangin' out.
Now don't get mad cause you knew from the start,
I was an asshole who would never go far.

Cause when you're really good to girls,
Give them your entire world,
They end up walking away.
(Hey, Hey)
They don't want a stand up guy, rather have you cheat and lie,
And do something they hate...

Girls don't want a gentleman,
They say they do but in the end,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me.
Girls don't want a gentleman,
If you want to get to them,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me.

Your parents cry when you bring me around,
They raised you up just so I can take you down.
There goes your life right before their eyes,
I'll have you bare foot pregnant, going out of your mind.

Cause when you're really good to girls,
Give them your entire world,
They end up walking away.
(Hey, Hey)
They don't want a stand up guy, rather have you cheat and lie,
And do something they hate.....

Girls don't want a gentleman,
They say they do but in the end,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me.
Girls don't want a gentleman,
If you want to get to them,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me.

I used to be a nice guy,
But that don't get you anywhere.
So now I'm just a piece of shit, idiot,
Who's too stupid to care.

If you give a girl respect,
Treat her like she's the best,
you're nothing to her.
She'd rather have you playing games,
Piss her off and make her wait,
If you want it to work...

Girls don't want a gentleman,
They say they do but in the end,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me.
Girls don't want a gentleman,
If you want to get to them,
Girls don't want a gentleman,
They want a loser like me. [x2]
(They want a loser like me) [x2]
