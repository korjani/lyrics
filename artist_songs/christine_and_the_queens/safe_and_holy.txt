Motus takes out all the drags for dancin'
With the rain they look disgusting
I'm feeling nauseous as they hold my hand
I've been crouching since the morning
But what I have left baby
What gave me hope lately
Are weathering fires when I'm dancing
Now I've got to have some patience
With the rhythm then you get strong
Fever asks for undisclosed believes
Your arms wide open can't be wrong
Cause what I have left baby
What gave me hope lately
Are heavy collapses when I'm dancing

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame,
To swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown childs of my own
My desires

My desires…
As I dance I'm safe and holy
As I dance I'm safe and holy

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame,
To swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown childs of my own
My desires
