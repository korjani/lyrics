Talking talking your way out
But he’s still on the lookout
I lost my voice I think I'm cursed
We make love as we rehearse
I'll cry a thousand more mirrors
So that your eyes could get brighter
Obediently I'll bear a name
I'll share it with the wind I tamed
But an you see my heart
Can you see my heart

Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn’t bother I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water and has his whole lips to drink

The water water is so cold
It poisons anyone who calls
A loving hand and daring kiss
Now watch here's everything you miss
It’s getting hard to look away
It’s not your real face anyway
This smile's too easy to disperse
Et moi je prie pour une averse
For you to see my heart
Narcissus is back
Narcissus is back
Narcissus is back
Narcissus is back
Narcissus is back
Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn’t bother I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water and has his whole lips to drink
