It's a blur
The pulsing is so loud, surely we'd feel better
If we had something to fight for
Oh, mother
I walk like a boy, mad at whoever
Would step on the game that he's just drew

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

Sure, we slur
Though we wrote it down
It's unclear and bitter
Tears and sweat can numb like melted snow
My anger
Once it's figured out, will finally matter
I'll pass it on to you, give it a go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

[Tunji Ige:]
We lose control when we were meant to win
Don't lose the focus, never settle in
We could find a way and end the sin
Or I could go and be the better man
I can follow
Wanna take the lead but I roam all alone
With a heart so hollow
While you holding the lock and the key to my soul
I guess this is a plea to be free, written to someone soul
If this is where we are, then tell me just where should I go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done (yet)
