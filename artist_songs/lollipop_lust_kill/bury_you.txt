This moment is the rest of your life
This moment is the rest of your life
This moment is the rest of your life
Comin atcha with a kitchen knife

You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
You make me wanna blow the world to kingdom come

Run, run go and lock your door
I'll huff and puff and blow it to the floor
Your mind games have invited me here
Now your all balled up and cringing in fear
At last you'll see my diabolical grin
Now it's time for the fun to begin

This moment is the rest of your life
Comin atcha with a kitchen knife

You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
You make me wanna blow the world to kingdom come

The second verse deader than the first
Time to rid me of your fucking curse
You should of stopped way back when
I got a bat I'm gonna beat your brains in
You can't escape your destiny
I'll get my hands on you and set you free

This moment is the rest of your life
Comin atcha with a kitchen knife

You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
You make me wanna blow the world to kingdom come

Your blood is what I love
And now you'll give it to me
Think of our love, it's done
And when you whisper to me
Your blood is what I love
And now you'll give it to me
Think of our love, it's done
And when you whisper to me
Your skin is your sin
Begin to start the ending of me
Your blood is what I love
And now you'll give it to me
