It seems I like it when you cry 
My codependant lullaby 
Ill only play when I make the rules 
Your mental weakness is my obvious tool 
It seems I like it when you cry 
So let me inside 

[Chorus]
Im alone with you and you're afraid of me 
Tightly close your eyes and pray you just can't see 
Everything, I; everything, I 
Everything, I; everything, I 

Blow out the candle, save the light 
One last dead breath it ends your night 
Hold out your hands and pray not to die 
Grow your little white wings and let your angel fly 
Blow out the candle save the light 
And let me inside 

[chorus]

Everything I want from you 
All the lies that you beleived 
Everything I misconstrue 
Is everything you cant conceive, yeah 

Can you see me here alive with your own two eyes 
Can you see me here alive? 

Please wont you tell me why you died 
And within the deadness was their light 
Where are you now and how does it feel 
Is there a soul or is our mind the real 
Please wont you tell me why you died 
And let me inside 

[chorus]

Want 
Need 

Everything I want you to see 
Everything I want you to be
