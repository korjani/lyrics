Use to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here,
but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach

Someone told me once
that there's a right and wrong,
punishment would come to those
who dare to cross the line.

But it must not be true
for jerk-offs just like you.
Maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole.
but I'm tired of waiting.

Maybe it's just bullshit and I should play GOD,
and shoot you myself.
Because I'm tired of waiting.

Consequences dictate
our course of action
and it doesn't matter what's right.
It's only wrong if you get caught.
If consequences dictate
my course of action
I should play GOD
and shoot you myself.
I'm very tired of waiting.

I should
kick you,
beat you,
fuck you,
and then shoot you in your fucking head.
