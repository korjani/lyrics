Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say.

Slid away from me. 
Crept away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
But there was nothing I could say.

What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need,
don't mean that much to me.

I can see your back is turning.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.
Love.

This is love.
This is love.
This is my love for you. 
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love.

Say
you
won't
go.

Get up.
Say, say.
Get up.
Say.

Get’chu up stronger up, babe
Get it, get it, get it,
Raah

What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need
don't make a fuck to me.

I can see your back is turning.
