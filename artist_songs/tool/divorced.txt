Well there aren't any here yet.

See your name in lights: send them in!

[around 13:30 into the song, this conversation takes place]
[Buzz:] What about Ryan?
[Maynard:] No, he blew it, he lost the number for the girl he met down here.
[Buzz:] Oh, and Adam said she's a beauty. 
[Maynard:] She's the one who has that fucked up voice.
[Buzz:] Is she a rocket scientist?
[Maynard:] The fuckin'... she has a voice like a fuckin' modem dude!
[Buzz:] (Laughs) Sounds perfect!
[Maynard:] Immatates a chick with a voice like a modem sayin' some weird
gibberish... (You have to hear it)
[Buzz:] (Laughs heavely)
[Maynard:] Then he got to work up there, you know Ryan gets off at work, I
guess to show that he has a dick.
[Buzz:] (Laughs again)
