It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then
You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
I've got my hands bound
My head down, my eyes closed
And my throat wide open

Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious
Won't you come a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Released in this sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole

Do unto you now what has been done to me

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Won't you come just a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
There's release in this sodomy
For I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

Got your hands bound, your head down
Your eyes closed
You look so precious now
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands
I've come round full circle
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon
You look so precious
