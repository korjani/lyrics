“Throw that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta here”

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh oh oh.

Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened

Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul.
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,

Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened too
I am scared like you
I am frightened
