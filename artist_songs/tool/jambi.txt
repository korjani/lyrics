Here from the king's mountain view
Here from a wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan I do
On treasures and flesh, never few.

But I, I would wish it all away.
If I thought I'd lose you just one day.

The devil and his had me down,
In love with the dark side I'd found.
Dabble in all the way down
Up to my neck soon to drown.

But you changed that all for me.
Lifted me up, turned me round.
So I...
I...
I...
I...
I would
I would
I would
Wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn.
Begged like a hooker all night long.
Tempted the devil with my song.
And got what I wanted all along.

But I,
And I would,
If I could,
And I would
Wish it away,
Wish it away,
Wish it all away,
Wanna wish it all away,
No prize that could hold sway,
Or justify my giving away,
My center.

So if I could I'd wish it all away.
If I thought tomorrow would take you away.
You're my peace of mind, my home, my center.
I'm just trying to hold on,
One more day.

Dim my eyes...
Dim my eyes...

Dim my eyes
If they should compromise
Our fulcrum
Wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone.

Shine on forever.
Shine on benevolent sun.

Shine on upon the broken.
Shine until the two become one.

Shine on forever.
Shine on benevolent sun.

Shine on upon the severed.
Shine until the two become one.

Divided I'm withering away.

Divided I'm withering away.

Shine on upon the many, light our way
Benevolent sun.

Breathe in union.
Breathe in union.
Breathe in union.
Breathe in union.
Breathe in union.
So as one survive.
Another day and season.

Silence, legion, save your poison
Silence, legion, stay out of my way.
