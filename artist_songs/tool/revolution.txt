[Maynard:]
Living on the street shores
He didn't learn and wanted children
Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"
He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]
He didn't wanna deal with it
Here they come, feelings that come as natural
Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all
He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]
Running away, getting some kinda cure
"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Give him your love, give him your love to save him

[Maynard:]
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Don't run away, give him your love to save him
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Give him your love...

[Zach screaming 2x:]
You can kill the revolutionary
But you can't kill the revolution
[Zach & Maynard screaming 2x:]
You can kill the revolutionary
But you can't kill the revolution

[Zach:]
Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves
Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness
Suicide or a slower death from addiction
seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Maynard:] Running...

[Zach:]
Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves
Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness
Suicide or a slower death from addiction

[Zach:]
Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain
Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Zach screaming 2x:]
You can kill the revolutionary
But you can't kill the revolution
[Zach & Maynard screaming 4x:]
You can kill the revolutionary
But you can't kill the revolution
