My, Out of my mind 
My life, I 
My mind, out of my mind 
My life, I 

So confident so, self obsessed no 
Compromise no, self obsessed no 

My...mind, out of my mind 

As you stare into the water 
Are you scared you'll be forgotten 
As you stare into the water 

My, Out of my mind 
My life, I 
My mind, out of my mind 
My mind, I 

Compromise no, self obsessed no 
Compromise no, self obsessed so 
Compromise no, compromise so 
Compromise so, self obsessed 

As you stare into the tide 
Are you scared to be forgotten 
As you stare into the water 

Terrified...terrified...terrified to be forgotten [x4]
