Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem
And on that fateful day when she was crucified
She wore Shiseido Red and we drank tea by her side

Sweet, sweet, sweet
Used to be so sweet to me, well

Muhammad my friend, I'm getting very scared
Teach me how to love my brothers who don't know the law
And what about the deal on the flying trapeze?
Got a peanut butter hand, but honey
do drop in at the Dew Drop Inn

Sweet, sweet, sweet
Between the boys and the bees

Sweet, sweet, sweet
Between the boys and the bees

And Moses I know, I know you've seen fire
But you've never seen fire until you've seen Pele blow
And I've never seen light, but I sure have seen gold
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
till I get my own, honey, TV show

Ashre, ashre, ashre, ashre

And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave
I got a place in the Pope's, honey, rubber robe
Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem
