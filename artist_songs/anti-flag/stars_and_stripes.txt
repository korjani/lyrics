and the tax dollars we're forced to pay, fund these heartless U.S. policies
their explanation... "it's national interest, national security..."

don't fly those stripes, those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
they Stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing i believe

at little big horn national cemetery, there's a monument that reads: "to the soldiers killed in montana while clearing
