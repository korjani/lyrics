There is a secret
I found a secret
Behind a Soho door

There is a reason
I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor

I found the water
The devils water
And walked along its shore

Is that what you want?

The channel's changing
The heart is racing
From voices on a wire

The soul is yearning
The coal is burning
The ember starts a fire

Can we recover
Love for each other
The measure of your life

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want

A river
A river
A river running under ground

A river
A river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x4]

Is that what you want
is that what you really want

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x4]

I am a river!

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x3]
