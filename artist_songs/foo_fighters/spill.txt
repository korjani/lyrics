One of these nights I'll shake you
I will take you from my veins
I'm getting tired of waiting
It's time to empty me

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you out again

Feeling me reach inside you
And I feel you run through me
Funny how you remind me
I got memories to drain

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you out again
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you out again

Bleed me slowly until every
Vein is empty just like you
Bleed me slowly until every
Vein is empty just like you

Please oh, please, you're draining me
I've got to bleed myself of you
Please oh, please, you're draining me
I've got to bleed, I've got to bleed for you

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you out again
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you out again
