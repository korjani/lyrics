It seems like only yesterday you were with somebody else
Soon as it was over though I had claimed you for myself
Didn't take me long before I had moved myself to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I'm glad to close the door

Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya

So far has been so good and it seems that we stand the test of time
You never call me "baby" but you refer to me as "mine"
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well, that's swell

You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the pub alone
You only cook from frozen but I don't ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you're doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you, I'm so happy, this is how we live

Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well, that's swell

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well, that's swell

As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well, that's swell

As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well, that's swell
