[Verse 1:]
So I went to posh school
Why would I deny it?
Silver spoon at the ready
So don't even try it
Yeah the house I grew up in it was Georgian
Ten bedrooms, beautiful proportions
Can't say that life isn't easy
Double negative: can't nothing please me?
Only make it here
Cause of my daddy
Fuck your tea bags
Yo, where's my tea caddy?

[Pre-Chorus:]
(This life, that life)
Life isn't fine but we all can try
(Not fair, it's not right)
Doing my thing I'm just
Keeping my head down and...

[Chorus:]
Do we have to
Keep talking about
Where you think it is I'm from?
And I'ma make you see
You don't know me
You don't know me
No things never change
No telling some people
I don't believe
I'm still here
Still telling you that you're wrong
And aren't you losing sleep?
You don't know me
You don't know me
No things never change
No telling some people

[Verse 2:]
So I got a trust fund, so what am I doing?
Buying property, can't be bothered with the viewings
I'm getting hungry, could you fetch my butler?
Step back I couldn't be any humbler
Sucked dick, got signed to a major
I'll do anything just to entertain you
I'm from West 11, and when it's over
I'm going straight to heaven in a Range Rover

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Round and round again (Oh, oh)
Please could you repeat the question?
Driving round the bend (Oh, oh)
I've heard it all before, and then some
Round and round again (Oh, oh)
Please can you repeat the question?

Doing my thing I'm just
Keeping my head down and...

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
And I'ma make you see
You don't know me
You don't know me
No things never change
No telling some people

And aren't you losing sleep?
You don't know me
You don't know me
No things never change
No telling some people

And I'ma make you see
You don't know me
You don't know me
No things never change
No telling some people
