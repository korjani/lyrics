I'm a beautiful (beautiful)
Powerful (powerful)
Fashionable (best dressed)
Animal

But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

Tell me I'm brilliant and talented and that I'm the best
And do you think I've still got it I think I've been depressed

There's no more free shit, my packages
My ten trips to the lemon trees My handbags, my pieces
I felt your words beneath me

Please sir, do you want my picture?
Do you want my address?
Do you want my fame?
Do you want my star?

Do you want my beauty?
Do you want my power?
Do you want my number?
Do you want my love?

But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

Sometimes I think to myself
That I might have got it all
The path I've chosen
Might not be the one I should be on

I can't get enthusiastic
About a shit load of plastic
I thought that would be easy
I thought it would complete me

But I want my evenings
And I want my girlfriends
And I want my peace
And I want my drugs

And I want my figure
And I want my glamour
And I want my life back
Where you're mine

I'm a beautiful (beautiful)

Fashionable (best dressed)

But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

If I lay down
What would I be
What if I starved
Would you like me

What have I done
Would you show me
How I lost my grip
Will you stand by me

But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

Miserable without your love

Miserable without your love
I'm miserable without your love
