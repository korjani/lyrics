It's 5 o' clock in the morning,
Conversation got boring,
You said you're going to bed soon,
So I snuck off to your bedroom,
And I thought I'd just wait there,
Until I heard you come up the stairs,
And I pretended I was sleeping,
And I was hoping you would creep in with me.

You put your arm around my shoulder,
It was as if the room got colder,
And we moved closer in together,
And started talking about the weather,
You said tomorrow would be fun,
And we could watch "A Place In The Sun",
I didn't know where this was going,
When you kissed me.

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time,
Watching telly, Drinking wine,
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone,
I no longer feel alone,
No longer feel alone.

I haven't left you for days now,
And I'm becoming amazed how,
You're quite affectionate in public,
In fact your friend said it made her feel sick,
And even though it's moving forward,
There's just the right amount of awkward,
And today you accidentally,
Called me baby.

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time,
Watching telly, Drinking wine,
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone,
I no longer feel alone,

Let's just stay, Let's just stay,
I wanna lie in bed all day,
We'll be laughing all the way,
You told your friends,
They all know,
That we exist but we're taking it slow,
Let's just see how we go,
Now let's see how we go.
