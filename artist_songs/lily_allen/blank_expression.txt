Snow is falling all around
Seven o'clock and the roads are blocked
So i walk downtown
There's no one else around

I look in the bar and immediately
I sense daydream
Look at me girl as if i was some kind of
A total stranger

Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face

The streets are dark
And there's no one about
I wander home
And all the lights are out
I keep wondering

Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face

Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face
