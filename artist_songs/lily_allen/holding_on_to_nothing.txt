[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I see his face
I want to hold you but it feels unsafe
Too scared to give me heart up now
I'm not brave enough to play my part now

[Bridge 1:]
Can you guarantee that you'll stay
Here with me, with me

[Verse 2:]
Feels strange like a foreign thing
I'm still waiting for the love to kick in
Sometimes when I watch you sleeping
I keep hand to check you're breathing

[Bridge 2:]
It's not fair, not your fault
Not at all, not at all

[Hook:]
Once bitten, twice shy
I try and I try, I try
Cause I'm holding on to nothing
I'm holding on to nothing
Once bitten, twice shy

[Verse 3:]
I can't seem to find the strength
What's the point in keeping you at arm's length
I want to love you but I can't imagine
What I'd do if the worst did happen

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Bridge 3:]
Where I've been, never thought
No I won't go back
Couldn't take anymore
I'm not going back
Going back, going back

[Hook]
