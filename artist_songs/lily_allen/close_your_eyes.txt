Hey hey
Hey hey

Baby baby
I have to say
That there's something you should know
When I'm standing there in my underwear
I know that I've let myself go
But I still feel sexy
When you undress me
And whisper in my ear
Come over here
Come over here

Let's spice it up, you can dress me up
I'll be anyone you like
Get my leathers on
Yeah, Let's get it on
Come on, ride me like a bike
I'll be Beyoncé
Baby say my name
Tonight you are my Hova
Baby come over
Baby come over

Close your eyes
Baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights
Come on let me get to work
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Then I'm gonna yank your chain
We can do it again
All over again

Driving your sedan up to my mini van
I see you in my mirror
Ain't no other chick
Gonna cut my shit
You know I'll have to kill her
You know how to use
That I'm 'bout to lose it
You blow my fucking mind
Park it right up behind
Park it right up behind

Close your eyes
Baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights
Come on let me get to work
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Then I'm gonna yank your chain
We can do it again
All over again

Where d'ya learn to do the things you do?
You're everything, you're all my dreams come true
You know your way around like no one else
Right there
Like you care
You're so close, so nearly there
Ooh yeah!

Come on now baby, yeah
Come on now baby, yeah
Come on baby, right there
Come on baby now, yeah
Come on baby, yeah
Come on baby not there
Come on baby, yeah

[2x]
Close your eyes
Baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights
Come on let me get to work
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Then I'm gonna yank your chain
We can do it again
All over again
