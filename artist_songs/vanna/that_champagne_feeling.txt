Short black dress falls off her shoulders
We're on top of the world
The evening air's intoxicating
We're on top of the world

We're on top of it!

Drink away, drown away your problems
Just move on
Drink away, drown away your problems
Just move on

All you can swallow
is still just a mouthful

Ready! Let's take our time
Bleed out our insides
One cut from this knife
and we'll bleed out our insides

Your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives
You looked so much better then
