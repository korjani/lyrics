I surround myself with the living
as they all play dead
I wish you could know
what I see inside my head
Look through eyes that
see through lies knowing
that there is no peace
for men who break the
hearts that take their
careless love to keep
while you're
playing god with beggars and thieves
on their knees
I'll be spreading treason through your
ranks with ease
town by town and
street by street no
rest no sleep
how many wolves do
I need to kill
till I find sheep
God damn I want to leave it all behind
erase all the memories from my mind
leave nothing but a trail of fucking dead
don't look back at me look straight ahead
town by town and
street by street
no rest no sleep
how many wolves
will I kill
till I find sheep
if you seen one then
you've seen them all
oh how the wicked fall
God damn I want to leave it all behind
erase all the memories from my mind
leave nothing but a trail of fucking dead
don't look back at me look straight ahead
look straight ahead
