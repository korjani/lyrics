In the name of a woman. Standing anxious at a window.
Counting waves to see. Our letters wash up.
Swearing us safe. Cut through the night.
Close your eyes. And ride the wind.

Into the depths. Her flowing beauty.
Never said what would become of us.
A truth too great for concern.
She wore her heart. Like a blood red stain.
On the chest of a velvet gown.
Thrown bare at the mouth of hell.

And all the grace. That she gave to the world.
Comes down tonight. Comes down tonight.
So we share. Our frozen gaze. An assuring bond.
To carry on. To carry on.

We’ll never be the same. No we’ll never be the same.

Home becomes our sun. breaking the horizon.
Like a spotlight to tired eyes.
Brilliant as the sun. breaking the horizon.
Like a spotlight to tired eyes.

So we lit the sails. And cast ourselves in.

To the searching eyes. We were a wreck.
A sight for miles. A scene to break.
A thousand hearts. If on ashes. We wash ashore.
Then by the sea we are spared.
We are spared and pure.

Into the depths. Her flowing beauty.
Never said what would become of us.
A truth too great for concern.
She wore her heart. Like a blood red stain.
On the chest of a velvet gown.
Thrown bare at the mouth of hell.

Never forget. The fury of a well aimed promise.

We’ll never be the same. No we’ll never be the same.
