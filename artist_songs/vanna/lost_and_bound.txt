The sky blacks out.
Blacks out, blacks out.

I wake up in the sand again,
Face down, choking on my life.
I begin to put back all the pieces of last night,
But then I realize I don't know where I have been.

Is this a place, is this a time?
Is this a place, is this a time?
Or has this lost boy finally lost his mind?
Is this a place, is this a time?
Is this a place, is this a time?
Or am I chasing a dream that was never mine?

Nevermind.

Just settle down in to the sand,
We'll sit here holding onto the night.
The sky blacks out, followed by dawn, 
Till morning comes to finish us off.

I watched you fade away.

Blacks out, blacks out.
Where did the daylight go?
Blacks out, blacks out.

Out up ahead a light,
That shines through this haze,
That once turned the night into days.
We've lost our way again,
But we'll keep moving until sleep.
We've lost our way again,
But we'll keep moving until sleep.
I'm falling down again,
Just can't keep myself on my feet.

Just can't keep myself on my feet.

Just settle down in to the sand,
We'll sit here holding onto the night.
The sky blacks out, followed by dawn, 
Till morning comes to finish us off.

This is the letting go,
This isn't what was meant to be.
This is the moving on,
This is the end of you and me.
Here is to letting go.
