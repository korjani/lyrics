Last day of light
and I'm wondering
how will the darkness creep in
or why it didn't
over throw me sooner than this
have you ever seen a man broken, and used
Broken, broken and used
They call that the blackout blues
we call that the blackout blues
There are night it speaks to me
from some place deep inside
when darkness overcomes a common man
in a place, where even innocence can't hide
You can keep your setting suns
I need the night and the shadow to come
Hold your hope and pity in hand
This time alone I'll stand
I've lost everything
still I'm wondering
is this the end
I'm lost in everything
still I'm wondering
is this the end (this is the end)
This is the end
all my days
have turned to night
I have turned my face from the light
there is no coming back from this
there is no
place that I will find rest
You can keep your setting suns
I need the night and the shadow to come
Hold your hope and pity in hand
This time alone I'll stand
hang my head for a final time
gasp the air I say goodbye
to the bottom, I keep no friends
as I get lower to my end
I've seen rock bottom and I've gone on through
these dying eyes have seen death a time or two
have you ever seen a man so broken and used
I've got the blackout blues
I've got the blackout blues
blackout blues
lights are fading out
lights are fading
lights are fading out
rest, deceased.
