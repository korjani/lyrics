We were born of this world as free as a bird, 
We gave ourselves these chains, this cage, and these words. 
Do we suffer or do we survive? 
Can we live or must we die? 
I fear the worst for this earth. 
How do we get this crooked path on course? 
For all mankind. 
For all of time. 

We could start a spark 

The world's in flames and we're blowing smoke. 
Feeding a fire and burning up hope. 
I'm afraid of everyone. 
I'm afraid of what we've done. 
Can our rights overcome our wrongs? 
Can this be our revolution song? 
For all mankind. 
For all of time.  

We could start a spark 
Don't leave the world in the dark 
We could start a spark 
Don't leave the world in the dark 

You hold freedom in your hands, 
In your heart and with your friends. 
So stand up, make a difference count. 
'Cause if not you, then who will dig us out.
