As I get closer
closer to the light
closer to the light
my eyes burn blind
black and white
black and white
I can see the light
burning bright
my eyes can see the light
It's like waiting to die
while feeling alive for the first time
watching everything just pass you by
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it in my bones
can you feel it in your own
one last glimpse through
through hollow rounds
illuminate
and fill with sound
and now these eyes
are burning bright
black and white
black and white
It's like waiting to die
while feeling alive for the first time
watching everything just pass you by
everything pass you by
you feel my eyes
like you feel the sea
my heart is here
and it's all I need
you feel my eyes
like you feel the tides
my heart is here
awake alive
breathe
breathe in me
breathe
speak friend
revived again
