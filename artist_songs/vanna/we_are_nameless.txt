our lives are theirs now. 
and they've buried our love. 
they thought that we'd forget. 
they thought that we'd forget.

come alive. 
just to see her face again. 
if not in this life. 
than the next. 
you spoke it oh so well.

after all the ink is gone. 
the letters fade and the page goes on. 
after all the ink is gone. 
the letters fade.

out falls the sun. 
giving proof. to our hope. 
we will echo. forever.

dear general. reflect glory. 
we will find a way to their hearts. 
reflect glory on us. 
we will fight our way tho their hearts.

we are nameless. in this place 
and should the wind blow. 
let it carry us home. 
we are nameless. in this place 
and should the wind blow. 
let it carry us home.

we are alive.
you'll never see this place again. 
let them know you are love.

after all the ink is gone. 
the letters fade and the page goes on. 
after all the ink is gone. 
the letters fade.

out falls the sun. 
giving proof. to our hope. 
we will echo. forever.

we will find a way. to speak on our regrets. 
that we've been holding inside ourselves. 
the storm has arrived at the worst of times. 
there's nothing on the ground. 
but it's all coming down. 
for now we'll lay here. 
trying to see. when we fall from this winter. 
what will be underneath.

this is our chance. to give all we have.

we are nameless. in this place 
and should the wind blow. 
let it carry us home. 
we are nameless. in this place 
and should the wind blow. 
let it carry us home.
