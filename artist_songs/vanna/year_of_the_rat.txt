22 and I'm losing heart
Self defeat becomes my art
Deconstruct, decompose
Alive not living and so it goes
I'm alone, I'm alone
A broken boy left on his own
I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm the only one left in my home

This is the year that I die
How many times have I said goodbye
Farewell to my former life
Eyes closed hold tight
Look to the light, look to the light
How many times have I said goodbye
Farewell to my former life
Eyes closed hold tight
Look to the light, look to the light
I'm ready to die

Black nights and lowest lows
And so it goes, and so it goes
Black nights and lowest lows
And so it goes

27 and I'm feeling right
Cleared out the skulls and bones from my life
Dead to myself reborn who knows
A man proud of where he goes
You have to breathe to be alive
You have to suffer to survive
You have to breathe to be alive
You have to suffer to survive

This is the year that I die
How many times have I said goodbye
Farewell to my former life
Eyes closed hold tight
Look to the light, look to the light
How many times have I said goodbye
Farewell to my former life
Eyes closed hold tight
Look to the light, look to the light
I'm ready to die

You have to breathe to be alive
You have to breathe to be alive
You have to breathe to be alive
You have to breathe to be alive

Crawl out, crawl out of your grave
Stand to your feet amazed
You've made it, you're here
No ground, no dirt, no fear
Let the light become your own
Don't let the grave be your home
