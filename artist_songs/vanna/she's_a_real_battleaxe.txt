He waits while the city is sleeping
She takes her time
He lost every ounce of patience
She takers her time

But they're catching on
They're watching us

Inside these walls
The ghosts still talk
Of death and beauty
Of times long since past

Don't forget your past

Through the window
Watching as he walks away
This time I've met my match

We're wrapped inside
Each others eyes
In this place that we call home
Let's take our time
And try to find
The things we love to fear the most

(Fear the most!)

This time you've let me go
There's nothing left for us
We'll keep our hearts to ourselves

(She fell like photographs)
