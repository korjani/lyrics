her name is. horror. model. lifeless. hallowed. 
and what she's doing. while no one's looking. 
it's not just wrong. it's murder. 
to everything i know is right. 
i have to find it in myself. 
to let her go. 
but by the sounds of their disarray.

she's found. her way to the hearts. 
of the good ones. left them blinded. 
and trying on the floor. she's only started.
her sad triumphant march. and in the wake. 
we are aching. wanting more.

inside of these. dreams you'll never wake from. 
we're fading away. you're coming undone. 
lay yourself down. i'll never let you wake up.

her ship will not be coming. 
for the plans have gone all wrong. 
what once held this body whole. 
has been stripped to the bone.

when you get what you want. 
show her the door. 
don't let her stay. 
don't let her keep walking. 
with her heart in my hand. 
i feel no remorse. 
she was dead to begin with. 
when you get what you want. 
show her the door.

inside of these. dreams you'll never wake from. 
we're fading away. you're coming undone. 
lay yourself down. i'll never let you wake up.

i've been asleep while walking. 
and it's gone on far too long. 
this is my return to living. 
and i'll keep what makes me strong.

if i could find it in myself. 
to put her down. out of her goddamn misery.

when you get what you want. 
show her the door. 
don't let her stay. 
don't let her keep walking. 
with her heart in my hand. 
i feel no remorse. 
she was dead to begin. 
when you get what you want. 
show her the door.
