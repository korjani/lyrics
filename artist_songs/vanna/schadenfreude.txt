Let's make this happen
Let's lay it all down now
You've been taken for granted
So let me show you around

(You'll never see the light of day again)

The walls were crawling with your insides

Your heart was shining like a chandelier

(They will never let you go!)

There's no escaping
You haven't the legs to stand on
And I'm so thankful
That I'm not in your place
And I'm so thankful
That I'm not in your place!

So that's what they call it these days!
OH!
