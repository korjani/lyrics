Does Death divide us all by light
the same way as the day decides the night
is darkness just where it begins
as I get closer does blindness set in
does death divide us all by light
are we buried beneath the ocean
or have the bodies we once had
all turned to dust
does Death divide us all by light
the same way as the day decides the night
is darkness just where it begins
as I get closer does blindness set in
look into these hollow eyes
I've seen the dead come alive
I've seen the dead come alive
the dead come alive
Forgive this face
for goodness sakes
what else could I do, this is my fate
if finding death is happiness
well then my friend wish me the best
bring me your bones
bring me your bones
let them be my own
If finding death is happiness
well then my friend wish me the best
bring me your bones
bring me your bones
and let them be my own
