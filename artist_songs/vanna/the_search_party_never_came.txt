We're as far as far can be
Let's take off our coats and stay a while
With nothing but the fire burning on

If we could stop ourselves right here
Then what would we do differently
In trying to make you see my point
I'll bury it deep into your chest

Can we let of past mistakes
Mistakes we made, or are they stronger
Stronger then the two of us

If we could stop ourselves right here
Then what would we do differently
In trying to make you see my point
I'll bury it deep into you

And in that moment
Time stood still
And from that point on
There was no turning back

There's a shadow on the wall
Moving slowly towards the door
Now the room is empty
and so are our lives

In the end
They'll never know

She waited and waited and waited
But they never came.

They never came!
