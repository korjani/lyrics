As her insides screaming, let me out
She speaks as if someone's in the room with her
(Someone sits quietly on the ceiling tile)
Still facing the corner with eyes gouged out
These tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now

Her heart beats on
She's just not, giving up yet
Though blinded by the devil's touch
She rises above him

(She rises above)

She races towards the light
Her heart beats on
(She stares death straight in the face, her heart beats on)
These tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now

As he cuts into her chest
Her heart beats on
She's just not giving up yet
Though blinded by the devil's touch
She rises above him
(Rise above)
She floats towards the light
{as} the darkness recedes
(Let me out, let me live again)
In this most desperate hour (she cries)
This desperate hour...

In this crowded room
In this crowded room
In this crowded room
With an empty view
In this crowded room

Save your goodbyes, cause we all know it's not the end
Save your goodbyes, cause we all know it's not the end
Save your goodbyes, cause we all know it's not the end
Save your goodbyes, cause we all know it's not the end
