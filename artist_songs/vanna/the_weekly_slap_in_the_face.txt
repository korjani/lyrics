I don't know if you, know if you, know. 
You've done damage, done damage to my soul. 
Dead at a young age. I watched my heart stop. 
I watched my hero turn his back and walk. 
Where are you going? How long will it take? 
If you're coming back, I'll just see here and wait 
and I'll learn from your mistakes, 
take them with me, make my life my own. 
Where have you gone? Where should you be? 
If you were here, then you would see, slap in the face. 
It's nothing new, sick of feeling disappointed in you. 
You don't call, you don't talk. 
I'm beginning to think it's my fault, 
know what happens to people you use? 
They stop giving a fuck about you. 
No one to lead, no one to guide, 
your mistakes won't destroy my life. 
You're not a man. I'll tell you why. 
Men don't leave their families to die 
and I'll learn from your mistakes, take them with me. 
I'll make my own home. Make my life my own. 
You're not a man, I'll tell you why. 
Men don't leave their families, 
leave their families just to die. 
I've made my name, you've ended yours in shame.
