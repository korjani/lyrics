Oh I'm waiting
in the calm before the storm
for the tides to turn and wash me away
oh debating the last time we felt warm
we've always turned a cold shoulder
to the blinding white light
where I know I'm not alone
gravity pulled me out here
to the reaching skyline
where men look for their rest
to my knees I drop at last
with worn out hands I
present them to the sky
only to feel your guiding light
to the blinding white light
where I know I'm not alone
gravity pulled me out here
to the blinding white light
where I know I'm not alone
gravity pulled me out here
maybe I can call this home
so many lights flickered black
yet you've refused to burn out like that
so to my true north
I let my body fade
and there I will live out
the rest of my days
for you have come and saved
brought the lost back
so you will remain here
and I'll fade I'll fade to black
and I'll fade
I'll fade to black
we all fade
we all fade to black
to the blinding white light
where I know I'm not alone
gravity pulled me out here
to the blinding white light
where I know I'm not alone
gravity pulled me out here
maybe I can call this home
you are the white light
we fade to black
you are the white light
we fade 
we fade to black
