Wet nightmare digging in my brain. 
I gotta put you to bed baby, you're all the same. 
Line 'em up just to knock 'em down. 
My pride and worth just came to drown. 

Can you feel electricity? (Electricity)
Your eyes tell this wolf all he needs. 
Lay down, you're my favorite prey. 
Eat up the flavor of the day. 

If pretty girls make graves in my head, 
Then my heart's a tomb for the undead. 
(My heart's a tomb for the undead)
If pretty girls make graves in my head, 
Then my heart's a tomb and now I'm dead. 
(then my heart's a tomb and I'm dead)

Look into these hungry eyes. 
Don't you see the beast inside? 
Keep it beating babe. I need to eat you alive. 
Don't you see the mess inside? 
I'm fucking rotten and feeding off lies. 

I've made my disgusting bed. 
A pig in shit, fucked and fed. 
I've made my disgusting bed. 
A pig in shit, fucked and fed. 

If pretty girls make graves in my head, 
Then my heart's a tomb and I'm dead

I'm sleeping in my grave. 
Die next to me. Die next to me.
I'm sleeping in my grave. 
Die next to me. Die next to me.

Lay me. Lay me. Lay me to rest.

If pretty girls make graves in my head, 
Then my heart's a tomb for the undead. 
(My heart's a tomb for the undead)
If pretty girls make graves in my head, 
Then my heart is a tomb and now I'm dead. 
(then my heart's a tomb and I'm fuckin dead)

I've made my disgusting bed. 
A pig in shit, fucked and fed. 
I've made my disgusting bed. 
A pig in shit, fucked and fed. 
Fucked and fed
