Blessed with this curse
curse of knowing
why I'm here
who to step on and who to fear
let me make myself clear
hands stop me
and wind won't sway me
they'll be the guide and forever take me
lift me up to where I belong
head high and moving on, and on and on
one swift move and
I'm out of your way
no rest for you here
no room here to stay
stare at the face of determination
gaze into perfection
I, won't be stopped
I, want the ground to give way
the horizon to break
I, want the mountains removed
swallow the sea with it too
I, want the ground to give way
the horizon to break
want the ground to give way
the horizon to break
want the mountains removed
swallow the sea with it too
I will consume you
forgiveness has all been used
I will consume you
your future has been removed
so please forgive me
as I sing this song
and with the slight of hand
you'll be moving along
oh don't get me wrong
did I leave you
broken and used
desperate now
oh I confuse
this is the sound of taking control
this is you and your letting go
your presence here will not be missed
you won't live through this
I am
I am the
I am
I am the end
you won't survive me
I am
I am the
I am
I am the end
you won't survive me
I am
I am the
I am
I am the end
you won't survive me
I am
I am the
I am
I am the end
you won't survive me
