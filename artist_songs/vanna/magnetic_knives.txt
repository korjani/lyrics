You have lost yourself
You will never be found
We'll cut from ear to ear
We will open you up

You have that look upon your face
The kind that razors can trace
Can we cut to the point?

Where have the carving knives gone?

We will leave you underground
Screaming out so loud
You won't make a sound

Last chance
Last breath
Last word
Let's have a prayer!

Lost in love
They'll need more than a shovel to dig you up
