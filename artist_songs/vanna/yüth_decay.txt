Bleed into your veins 

Let the youth decay. 
Let the youth decay, 
Rot and fall away 

Heaven knows you're miserable and doesn't care 
Hell is in your head and in the skin you wear 
Black shoes, black shirts, black hearts everywhere
You don't light up rooms when you walk into them

They fade to black 'cause they feel your sin 
Our heads have holes as black as our souls, 
But we're gonna die if we don't get control
Our heads have holes as black as our souls, 
But we're gonna die if we don't get control

Bleed into your veins. 
Let the youth decay. 

Reflections I can't seem to find 
Faces no longer mine
There's nothing staring back at me 
'Cause nothing is now all I see

Bleed into your veins 
Let the youth decay 
Our heads have holes as black as our souls

Bleed into your veins 
Let the youth decay
Our heads have holes as black as our souls

I suck the life out of everyone
Sky swallow and I'm eating the sun 
Cast shadows ain't got shit on me
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen 
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen 
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen 
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen 
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen 
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen
