J.Dash...

Uh-oh [X2]

[Chorus:]
I made a little bit of money (I made a little bit of money)
I paid my bills (I paid my bills)
I paid this cover (I paid this cover)
I wont stand still (I wont stand still)
Let me see you
Wop [X7]
Now let me see you
Wop [X18]

[Verse 1:]
Wop If you let me get lost, if you don't
Look at the reaction when I hit em in the front
Got fleezy in the back and chello in the front
Listen to the record boy I got what you wont
Beatz so fly cuz the club on chomp
Got hizz like woofs beatin in the back of the door
Ladies take it back throw back the joint
Bend at the waist, lean to the front
Now BOUNCE yo body to the, just a little bit harder
Shawty move yo feet just a little
Aint nobody here wop better than me
Purple flag to the left WHO better than me.
I got an all star squad who better than me.
Man listening to the beat who better the me.
I payed to get in so I ain't goin to jail and then be weepin' way to long...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
J. Dash why you had to do it like that
Got the ladies checkin' they bags
Wopping like they breakin' they backs (breakin they backs)
Takin' it: back, back, back... wait!
Now I'm checkin shawty with a micro craves (craves)
Hotta' than a baby in a microwave
Look at how she woppin' man she might get paid
Wop Wop Wop a little harder
Look at how she wop she a party starter
I hope that security remembered to card her
Cuz I never done the wop where you ain't hotter
I never drop dime but I drop u a dollar
Tell her if you give me your number then maybe I call her
She said that she knew me and know I'm a baller
Man I better wop outa here I'll see yall tomorrow.

[Chorus]

Now drop it to the floor, drop drop it to the floor then
