Fussing and fighting, we, back at it again
I know that its my fault you don't understand (no)
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my friends
I should try, to decide, want to let you in, but (no) that means memories, and it's crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know

Girl I really wanna work this out cause I'm tired of fighting (tired of fighting)
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you (you, you)
I said I really wanna work this out, but girl I'm trying, its no excuse, no excuse

(But I got this) I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
(But I got this) Icebox where my heart used to be (I said I got it)
(No) I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold (I said I got it)
(No) I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold

(But I got this) I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
(I said I got this) Icebox where my heart used to be
(No) I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold
(No) I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold

Why can't I get it right? Just can't let it go?
I open up she let me down 
I won't feel that no more (no)
I got memories this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
Cause my heart is in the same old condition that baby left it
(and I) I apologize for making you cry 
Look me in my eyes and promise you wont do me the same

Girl I really wanna work this out cause I'm tired of fighting (fighting)
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you (you, you)
