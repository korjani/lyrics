[Chorus]
Tonight
We're gonna paint the town
No more messin' around
Tonight
I want to show the world
This love I've found

When I first laid eyes on you
Chills ran up an down my spine
I couldn't find the words to say
But yet and still you read my mind

And now we have a date, I can hardly wait
All day long I've thought of you
To have a real good time is my state of mind
This could be the start of love

[Chorus]

At first I tried to play it cool
To try and make you want me more
But I got trapped by my own game
Cause you're the one that I adore

And now we have a date, I can hardly wait
All day long I've thought of you
To have a real good time is my state of mind
This could be the start of love

[Chorus]

Hey

Now we have a date, I can hardly wait
All day long I thought of you
To have a real good time is my state of mind
This could be the start of love

Tonight
Oh
No more messin' around
Tonight

I want to take it to the edge
Of your fantasies
Let me take you anywhere
You think we should be

Tonight
Tonight
Oh, ho, oh,
Tonight

Tonight
Tonight

Tonight is gonna be alright
Tonight
Tonight is gonna be alright
Tonight

Tonight is gonna be alright
Tonight
Tonight is gonna be alright
Tonight

I want to take it to the edge
Of your fantasies
Let me take you anywhere
You think we should be

Oh, ho, oh,
Tonight

[Chorus]

Yeah,

[Chorus]

Hey,

Tonight
Ho
Tonight
Tonight
