Hm
(Look to the stars)
Ooh ooh 

If you're walkin' down a road and see a falling star
(Keep on walking) Do you make a wish (Keep on walking, keep on walking)
Ooh, just remember luck is no such thing
One man succeeds while another man fails
Why is it then you ask the stars up above
The planets of life who controls your very soul

From the beginning of birth
And throughout eternity
As does the stars up above
(Just ask them) Ooh, the planets of life (Just ask them)
Who controls your very soul

Ask them why Leo is so sound and practical
And Gemini so inconsistent
Ooh, let me tell you a secret I know
Known the world over
Your life is controlled by the stars
(Just ask them) Ooh, the planets of life (Just ask them)

(Virgo) Virgo is known for versatility
(Taurus) While Taurus, oh, persistency
(Aries) Yet Aries to be very, very ambitious
(Libra) Libra, they're cheerful and merry, whoa

Pisces, the fish, you are romanticist
Constantly trying to escape from reality
Into the bliss land of Atlantis

Mm whatever your sign may be
Look to the stars of happiness and love

Aquarius (Aquarius) you try to refuse the people
Will always let the sun shine in
Oh, but Cancer, I know you are patient and understanding
Why is it that Scorpio can be lead astray

Ow, Sagittarius, keep on being independent
Uh-huh, Capricorn keeps the faith, baby
Mm, your stable personality
Why is it then you ask the stars up above
The planets of life, yeah, yeah
