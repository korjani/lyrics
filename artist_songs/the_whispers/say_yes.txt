Come here
Let's talk dear
There are things inside me
I want you to hear

I want to soak into you like rain
Make love until my energy drains
And as lust erases all shame
You'll scream my name out of pleasure, not pain

If you just say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
I will do the rest
(I'll do the rest)

Come here
This is your hour
Ooh, like raindrops on a flower
Come bathe in my love shower

Then let me blow your body dry
Kiss the tears from your sexy eyes
And as our passion begins to rise
We'll lay hypnotized by the pleasure inside

If you just say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
Please say yes, I'll do the rest
(I'll do the rest)

Oh, I want to build you a dream home
Made of love, not just wood and stone
Give you the deed to all that I own
Give you love beyond limit
Give you babies in our image

If you just say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
Please say yes, I'll do the rest
(I'll do the rest)

If you just say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
Ooh baby
(Say yes)
I will do the rest

Have you ever been kissed from head to toe
Down your back, around your navel
Well, you got that comin', my sweet
And even more tricks and treats
I'm willing and I'm able

Because I love you
Really, really love you
And I'm so damn proud of you, baby

Say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
I will do the rest
(I'll do the rest)

If you just say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
I will do the rest
(Say yes)

Say yes
(Girl, if you would only say yes)
