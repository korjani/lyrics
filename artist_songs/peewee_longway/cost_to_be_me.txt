[Pre-Hook:]
She asked me how a young nigga came wit them bands and drugs make you live this good
She asked me why a young nigga name in these streets and why a nigga keep it so hood
She ain't never seen a nigga like me around the club
And she want to get it understood
She heard bitches ain't bossing
Wanna live real good, want a young nigga to take her out the hood

[Hook x4:]
It cost to be a nigga like me
It cost to be a boss living good

It cost to be a nigga like me
It cost to be a boss living good
Built my bitch a house in the loft in the woods
Bitch dating a boss and he keep it so hood
Frosty so frosty I love it when she do it
Open like boxes she catch the jug jug
Longway so slaucy and I put that on hood
Trappin a benz and a check just like Nike
Boy get yo bitch, what you mean she don't like me?
She ain't never seen a nigga like me
Cruisin a fristol with stupid ass watches
Flippin a brick just like stuck in hibachi
You don't get to fall, lose it like me
Take a bitch roll two burnt doobies like me
Skeet on her titties, too freaky for Wee
I get the picture, she feeling you Wee
Yeah it cost to be a nigga like me
Even imposters can't duplicate me
Smoke like a rasta when I roll OG
Chicken shrimp pasta when me and my los feast
Even a mark monster acknowledge me
Cause it cost to be a boss nigga like me
I run a trap house just 7 days a week
It really cost to be a nigga like me
Longway

It cost to be a nigga like me

I ain't never seen a nigga like me waiting from her like the meno thought I told you that I'm servin lean
Fuck a nigga mean? He can never be me
He juggin the bricks and I'm juggin OG
Difference between me and you my g, I'm from out the bricks and you from out the suburbs
I just fuck and duck ya bitch and you just try to love her
Let her in my mansion she tried to fuck without a rubber
You are too different my brotha
I really wish you was my nigga, like no one other
Please be my distance
Bitch I'm a boss and I'm fuckin wit 50
It cost to be a real deal boss ass nigga
Colossal living, you hoes just gold diggers
Pass on bands, I got more I got more
It ain't no pressure on this cash
She upper echelon, living so fabulous
Throw it in the backseat, don't look at the tag
She so exclusive, she neck back the jag
My bitch from Bermuda, she know that she bad
Look on your computer, Longway the hashtag
Audi A7, it came with a hatchback
I keep it too hood and still fucked the nack nack
I come out them trenches slangin 80 crack
Longway
