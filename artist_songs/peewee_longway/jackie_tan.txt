Longway bitch

[Hook - PeeWee Longway:]
Molly Jackie Tan
Cherry pie back, pull up with the cash
Percocets on my ass
I just smoked the gas
Roll up out the bath, Tussionex on me
And I'm scratching on my ass
I just smoked the gas
Roll up out the bath, Tussionex on me
And I'm scratching on my ass
I just smoked the gas
Roll up out the bath, Tussionex on me
And I'm scratching on my ass

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]
I only smoke KK, my dick like an AK
Cut these hoes like they's late
Duck these hoes like dang dang
And they come back like a layaway
Fuck her on the first night
I don't do no day dates
I drive old schools, no wraith
VIP we hallway, AOD we blow K
Smoke and kill, OJ
Big G ur a lower case
Get jammed lawyer throw the case
I don't know the name I don't know the face
Try me that's a no-no
Fuck around, goons be on your top just like a go-pro
Them pounds we gon' blow those
We count it all then throw it up in slow mo
I'm riding in my low-low

And I'm scratching on my ass

Roll up out the bath, Tussionex on me
And I'm scratching on my ass

[Verse 2 - PeeWee Longway:]
Yellow banana purchase it with Phantom
Jacket just hand me a booth from Atlanta
Bust your shirt up like Tony Montana
Make some Margiela move out of Banana
Wiz Khalifa reefer smoke by the pound
Drunk on Juicy J like I'm on the brown
Touching that Hi-Tech I'm sipping on Actavis
Back to the future we triple-cup now
Flipping them Mr. Blue Benjamins
Sir with that scrappin we double down
Ferragamo buckle, buckle down
Jacket tan but I ain't Bobby Brown
I should trap chinatown
Hit the road I'm trapping in your city
Tossing that panic you sipping it
Pocket loaded with blue Benjamins
I'm gon' buy another kidney
Rolling Stone, Barbara Whitney
Gas batch got us pimpin'
Pop the shit Oprah Winfrey
Stepping the star through Givenchy
Just for buying mr Bentley
Dropping bands off in the trenches
Doing the dash in the Bentley, Longway bitch

And I'm scratching on my ass

[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]
Drink up, you already know what's in my cup
Purple punch, getting lit, at the trump
Talking money, OG killa skunk
No crack no dutch
Niggas know I smoke them papers
I ain't with that shit bruh, bitch I'm taylor
All my hoes want, mo' money, mo' money, mo' money
I play along like, "what money, what money, what money"
Ain't no shortcuts with me, if you ain't working that ass
Things in life don't come free, if you ain't twerking that ass
Two mill in the house, a hundred stacks in the sofa
I don't shop at ikea, ten racks is a coster
I'm burning loud, I'm high as the moon
With Jackie Tan, apollo thirteen
How high can a nigga drop these bands
