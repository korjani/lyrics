[Intro - Young Thug:]
Huh, Thugger, Longway
Stoner, Stoner!

[Pre-Hook - Young Thug:]
When I whip dope I'm looking to break my wrist
When I whip dope I'm looking to break my wrist
When I whip dope I smell the venomous fish
I'm Donald Trump, you think I won't fire my bitch

[Hook x4 - PeeWee Longway:]
Break it down, speed it up, break it down, speed it up
Breaking my wrist tryna double up

[PeeWee Longway:]
Whippin' the fuck out the dough with the beater
I'm breaking my wrist tryna double up
Speed it up, break it down, speed it up
I'm shifting the gears in the Bentley truck
I'm Donald Trump I just fire my bitch
These bitches know that I don't give a fuck
I call Young Thugger to hit 'em up
I told 'em buck fifty now big ups

[Young Thug:]
I got 'em son, like I'm from New-York
Sixty-five hundred for her brand New-York
Louis scarf wrap me, I'm Jamaican tough
Double cup [?] I pour with the [?]
Nigga drop down on you with that wagon
And you do not shoot it, boy you know you get stuck
Ain't talkin' fit, but I just bought a truck
Ran up my money, broke boy call it luck

[PeeWee Longway:]
The brick wrapped in ribbon, these black powder incence
My trap house is boomin' I slow it up, speed it up
MC Hammer diamonds dancin' VV'd up
OG batch stuffed in the pantry, gon' beat it up
Bitch look like Marilyn Monroe from the feet up
My bitch want me to bare-back her when I beat it up
My clip got a double stack'a who want beef'a [?] for the reefer
Longway

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x4]

[Offset:]
Breaking my wrist tryna double up
Pourin' up Actavis double cup
Wanna take a ride with me then buckle up
I'm number one, you niggas runner-up

[Quavo:]
Quavo coolin' on the boat on Bermuda
She takin' the molly, reboot like computers
Stackin' a hundred that longer than rulers
I'm callin' up Skip and your flip on my shooter

[Offset:]
Break it down, speed it up, re-it-up
I cop a Bentley, Lamborghini truck
The trap the gas station, get filled up
No deal but I'm still worth a million

[Quavo:]
He got the gas and I got the white
Touchdown on them birds, singing like McKnight
The 3 amigos in my chain like to fight
The 3 amigos in my chain like to fight!

[Offset:]
In the lab, feel like a scientist
They callin' me King, Your Highness, my dope is the finest
I'm righteous, you niggas pockets on [?]
I bought my two chains, I'm a start up a riot

[Quavo:]
Longway it's been a long day
I'm tired of the trap in the hall ways
Nigga pulled up on me say that he gotta be jugg
Whatever my dog say (Hurr!)
