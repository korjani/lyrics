(Longway, Longway, blue on my end, bitch)
We made it clear
Cut from a different cloth
This cloth, can only be found in select areas..
(You ain't cut like me.. what cloth were you cut from?)

[Hook:]
These niggas be screaming they with the shit
These niggas be screaming they gangster
These niggas be screaming that trap shit
Be the same niggas, that scream out your name
These niggas ain't cut like me
These niggas ain't cut like me
These niggas ain't cut like me
These niggas ain't cut like me
These niggas be screaming they with the shit
These niggas be screaming they gangster
These niggas be screaming that trap shit
Be the same niggas, that scream out your name
These niggas ain't built like me
These niggas ain't built like me
These niggas ain't built like me
These niggas ain't built like me

You see me that on me lil nigga
No hesitation I squeeze on the trigger(pow, pow, pow!)
With no co-defendant that 40 my nigga
Trapping in the trenches, Callaso living.(trap, trap, trap)
Why me work that bitch, her name Mrs. Bentley
Pussy nigga, get interrogated go snitch
These niggas ain't really with the traplife shit
Working all the time, they telling on shit
Ain't got no convo for bales or a brick
Keep the cash I ain't trying to get in Paperwork
These niggas ain't shit like me. (Like Wee)
Catch your bitch, and she dropping her panties first
These niggas ain't shit like me
I'm cut from a whole 'nother cloth
Run the sack up, stash it, no I ain't go ball
I keep me two pistols, no undo at all
And a bitch so we can go work out the spot

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I really ain't feeling your gangster my nigga
They did cut you from the same blanket my nigga
Crippin with 50, don't hang with no wangsta
Shoot some shit up until we see bodybags
You can pull up to my spot we sell nothin but bags
Foreigns on foreigns with the paper tags
I run up them bands so don't go out sad
I talk on the phone because it might be the Fed
Trying to purchase it but I end the call on his ass
I thought you were gangster, now you tell the Twelve
I had to relocate the spot on their ass
Trappin the same old shit just a different mailman
Same clientele with the same old scale
These lil niggas ain't cut Like me, can't you tell?
They screaming that shit
I'm really with that shit
Pull up where you at?
I'll flip your shit!
