[Verse 2 - HoodRich Pablo Juan:]
I was a youngin' thuggin' Till I got plugged in
To the drugs and the money, but he ain't really want it
Started smokin with junkies, I ain't too proud to beg David Ruffen
[PeeWee Longway:]
My young niggas in the hood banging like colors
Pull up at the back and hit yo ass with them cutters
[HoodRich Pablo Juan:]
And watch how I'm coming
I feed em bananas they acting monkey
I still got to blast cuz my young nigga buggin
Serving bunyuns, stepping on a brick
I break it down into onions and give it to youngin'
Trap stay open like a dunkin donuts
I'ma whip up the O's and serve all the junkies
Will serve em with a Rollie bezel 40 pointer
Listen to Tom Joyner early morning
New release on the brick stamped Michael Jordan
Trap with no strap kick his ass off the corner
