[Intro - Quavo:]
Yeah, Migos, Rocky!
Say you wanna be somebody, right?
Feel like Rocky Balboa

[Hook - Quavo:]
You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Gone!
I used to be an underdog (I used to)
Now a nigga on top of your ho
Rock Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Run to the top of the stairs in Philly
I'm feeling like Quavo, Meek Millie
It's level to this shit in my city
The dub, the 100 the 50
Young nigga back then drinking midgets, I did it
Lil (lil) mama used to laugh at me, 
Now she hitting my phone like please Quavo fuck with me!
Remember that nigga Orlando, Finessed him with Oregano
Rabbit food, Blues clues
Snooze you lose, That's the game fool
Remember when he was on top
In high school, I remember that
Then reality hit and I rolled up with them with my Audi coupe

[Hook - Quavo:]
You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Gone!
I used to be an underdog (I used to)
Now a nigga on top of your ho
Rock Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

[Verse 2 - PeeWee Longway:]
Rocky Balboa, Itallian Stallion
Cruising in my McLaren
Pulling up, Rocky Balboa, my dial, my diamonds are VVSS's
Used to be a underdog, now I'm a big dog
Trapping got gas in the mansion
Take a nigga bitch, Switch-A-Roo the click
Party, Party, Party like Marilyn Manson
PeeWee Longway, I made the name
I changed the game, put dope in her pampers
Give me her address and don't tell her name
This is my life get a clear understanding
Fresh out the banana boat with the dope
Bitch be treating me like I'm the pope
Fly as a bitch form the A, the left coast
Kicking bitch shit I'm Sosa with the loafs
Long way!

[Hook - Quavo:]
You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Gone!
I used to be an underdog (I used to)
Now a nigga on top of your ho
Rock Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
What did you wanna be when you were growing up
A basketball player, a football player or even a rapper?
Some niggas they wanted to be on the block
They dreamed to be trapping
Trapping the nigga out like I'm a Capo, or maybe an Alpha
Cooking dope but I'm no chemist
Adrian all in my kitchen
Molly  you looking like danger
Bob and weave, then hit the canvas
Where's the food in my fryer, or it connected with the banana's
I feel like Kanye, all of these cameras
Just to hit a Jug in the Camry!

[Hook - Quavo:]
You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Gone!
I used to be an underdog (I used to)
Now a nigga on top of your ho
Rock Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa
