Migo Gang MPA shit

[Peewee Longway (Offset):]
(We started in bandos and now we on every channel)
Satellite, Comcast, Xfinity, Fios
(Giuseppe safari, you're walking on top of animals)
Safari, Jumanji, they call me George of the Jungle
(Put your bitch on the 'Gram and she wanna fuck on the counter
Boot that bitch up on the 'Gram
Boot that bitch up on the 'Gram
Pull up in a 'Lamb, I challenge you in your Challenger)
Supercharged whip, fuck up the lot, I make chemicals
(I be dabbing on bitches, they say I don't got no manners)
Don't give no fuck bout this bitch, she get the pipe behind the counter
(Naked bitch up in my kitchen cooking Hannah Montana)
Got that bitch serving the grammies till she cop me a Phantom

[PeeWee Longway:]
Yellow LA bitches on the way to Atlanta
10 Pack of Hi-Tech, a case of strawberry Fanta
Give her percocet, she eat the dick up like a banana
PeeWee Longway is an animal
John Bird, south raised, still trapping cannabis
I'm the CEO of MPA, I run my own management
Let that chopper do the damage
Price on your head like it's dandruff
I always new knew I could trap or die, put the weed in the cabinet
Talk your bitch out her pants ho
Let the stripper give her grammies though
Flex in the Lamborghini on broadway with suicide doors
Fuck a lot of [?]
Get them bands from the backend' and break my wrist on the stove

[Offset:]
I'm in Canada, diamonds drip off my wrist like a chandelier
Got a mili to your hundred, tell me who the real man in here?
Put that dope in her booty and wrap her body up with cannabis
Niggas talking about trapping, capping, but really they can't even handle it
I jump in the Lamb' or 'Rari
Fuck on your bitch, she a thottie
She want a narcotic party
Perky, Xans, and Molly
We back on that ignorant shit, pull out Glocks for the business shit
We start shit then finish it
On that drank, fuck my kidneys shit
I got money in my hand, I'm a popular demand
Cooler than a fan, I got diamonds from Japan
I got weed for the plug, who talking about? Ferdinand?
Drums like a band fuck with set don't fuck with sams
