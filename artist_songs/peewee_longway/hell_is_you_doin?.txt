[Hook:]
I'm not afraid to go get the money, Hell is you doin'?
Breaking' my ankles I'm still chasing' money, Hell is you doin'?
When 12 hit the block I'm a still serve my junkies
The hand chopper came with wanna clips for the monkeys, monkey ass nigga
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
Hell is you doin? Let's get it

[Verse 1:]
My trap house my office for the work week
In the kitchen with the pyrex pot fiona beat them birds
Then we juug em out the low-key
Chicken you can get yourself a three piece
Putting up Forgiatos on three piece
Hundred pints of lean in my trunk
Bitch like my name double trump
My dope man get the dope with the pump
Who's the fuck nigga that jumped you
Send his ass out to the dump
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, fuck nigga didn't even know to me
Hell is you down' Givenchy my ankles still chasin' cheddar cheese
I go by big dog that get the work and yo nigga look up to me
MPA Bandcamp gone bust down the couture
Fuck nigga give me that jewelry
Kill everybody in the room but the
Wrap the work up ship it out to Missouri
Ain't no faces on the case so they don't get the jury

[Hook:]
I'm not afraid to go get the money, Hell is you doin'?
Breaking' my ankles I'm still chasing' money, Hell is you doin'?
When 12 hit the block I'm a still serve my junkies
The hand chopper came with wanna clips for a monkey ass nigga
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
Hell is you doin? Let's get it

[Verse 2:]
You with it, I'm with it jugging' hid the racks in the floor of the civic
Chasin' the paper, pull up to my spot Longway Longway Got Perfect Attendance
House full of bitches I dream of Genie
Thots and Kardashians they dressed in Bikinis
Longway pull up in the Blue Lamborghini
Stop by Benny's for a plate of Zucchini
Hell is down' what the fuck is you sayin'?
Molly Santan rocks in my pants, she asked for a sprinkle to come out the pack
She wanna rock right now, I beat that bitch up then she hammer time
In the kitchen whip it up til overtime
I got the white Kevin Federline
Fuck 12 hit the block we servin'
Jung out my Double R I'm so conservative
Hell is down' I ain't never heard of him
Fuck nigga screaming' he purchased the birds the hell is he doin' I ain't serving' it to him
Cinco De Mayo come one time a year and I front out them birds I got stashed in the rear
Balancy's, Giuseppe Zanotti, I be trappin' in that type of gear

[Hook:]
I'm not afraid to go get the money, Hell is you doin'?
Breaking' my ankles I'm still chasing' money, Hell is you doin'?
When 12 hit the block I'm a still serve my junkies
The hand chopper came with wanna clips for the monkeys, monkey ass nigga
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
Riding round juugin' out the low-key, riding round juugin' out the low-key
