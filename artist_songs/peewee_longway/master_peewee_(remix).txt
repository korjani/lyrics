I see murders everyday in my hood
I got fiends on the corner
Bust a brick down it smell like ammonia
Mister Serve-On standing on the corner
I can hook you up if you want it
Ice Cream Man I'll whip up Napoleon
Smoking on the three gram blunts of the sherb
Tiffany Benjis on my face look like a nerd
A thousand and 8 on both my ears 2 birds
Hop out with that Silk da Shocker at your shirt
I'm a let her do the dirt (do the dirt)
Black and blue coming over with the work
Frank Meuller got the bird flu alert
G-wagon came mounted up with the skirt
Bricks in the hood I'm a show you how to do it
Cooking up, young niggas I was bombs bombs bombs
M.P.A tanks, extendos, all they drums
Tatted my body up like a subway in Harlem

Drop a deuce bring the gram back stepped on
