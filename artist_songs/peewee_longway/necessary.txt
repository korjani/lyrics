[Verse 1:]
Smoke good gas like Snoop Lion
I got boxes flying across grand canyon
I got homies and they creeping' my zion
Longway the leo lion, serving' if you buyin'
That's a clean brick very flaw diamonds
Draped up full of gas of diamonds
Product of the block and I'm a product of the environment
Thinking like O dogg a menace II society

Peewee got the hookup okay
Peewee got the hookup okay

Flipping bales mail it
Young nigga gone scale it
Umbrella Double RR came with stars in the ceiling
Beamer with bad bitch necessary my criteria
Used to juug it in the cafeteria every third period
Ring on every fuckin' finger Mr. T my idol
Like Frank Lucas got the rifle and the bible
Since a diaper Menace to society came up on a [?]
Flip a niggas shit gone bust his head til the white meat
Ice cream mane cane the only thing that excite me
Mr peewee in the trap with dope boy Nikes
Draco 223 gone make your whip do the hyphy
Pernell gave me that 442 told me you got to go to Rice Street
Longways Bitch
