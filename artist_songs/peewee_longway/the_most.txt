(I do the most, I do the most, I do the most
I do the most, I do the most, bitch I'm the GOAT)

[Hook:]
Ain't never missed a shot on that work they say that I'm the GOAT
Stars in the ceiling I'm pulling up in the Ghost
Bitch it ain't no dine in, and you get this dick to-go
I'm a gas bag trapper, stack them bands up like they blow

[Bridge x2:]
I do the most, I do the most, I do the most
I do the most, I do the most, bitch I'm the GOAT

Cuban link around my fuckin throat
Crip blue my bandana, bitch I'm mutherfuckin locc
Overnight them gas bags, bricks come on a boat
Longway Sean Michael jumpin off the top fuckin rope
Peter piper you can pick a pocket, big chop in the piper
Hand chopper, I'm a fuckin sniper, drums on the rifle
Your momma still call you Baby Boy
I change your fuckin diaper
I'm a 80 crack slanger, twist my fingers and I bang it
I got clean like a stainless steal, and whip white like a handkerchief
Flippin the Package, Stackin Blue Benjamin, Pints of Lean Codeine Dranker

Crip blue 63 got the seat back just like im (?)
