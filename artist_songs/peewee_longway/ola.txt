[Verse 1:]
Just a lil somethin to do
Pull up on her ass in that new thang

Diamonds in my Rolly all cocaine
I usually don't talk to no strangers
But this the type of bitch go bang em
Sippin on Texas ranger
And I don't even wanna know your name

Serving them chickens e coli
Switching the whips iRobot

Bad bitch lookin like aloha
Fuck the shit out her still turn my head
Like who are you who are you
Fatass on her no Jenny Craig

Bustin her down at the drive thru
Turnt the fuck up on these hoes
The pay you nevermind too
My occupation is the stove
31 to a duece
(Longway!)

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Who are you I don't know

Cash out the money in envelopes
On the top rope like Chris Jericho
Swagged up with the Givenchy toe
No conversation with stranger hoes
My shit made in italy
I climb on yo bitch like a centipede
The molly be giving me energy
Control the block with good quality
I don't know her I don't see her
Don't believe her Ola
Nice to meet ya
My money older than the fucking beatles
Hit the pussy Derek Jeter
PInk diamonds call it easter
Swag so sick nigga got the measles

Jamaican shooters call em shottaz
Birds singin like a opera
Who are you you a imposta

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Peewee:]

Margielas Alligator
MPA bandcamp boss of the label
Bricks now sushi they raw as they come
