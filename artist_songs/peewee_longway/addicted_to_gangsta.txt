Cop a 5 to a 9 go to the work with the pack

Bitch go check the skirt when I drop off the pack
Just bought a 18 wheeler seems like I drive it better when I'm backing it back
Everybody knows I'm a dealer Dope on my Maison Margielas little bitty bitch due to the fact
Ooh carti rap Longway just told me I'm dabbin' like wax

Serving a chicken 18 I'm fuckin' little shawty we splitting the cap
