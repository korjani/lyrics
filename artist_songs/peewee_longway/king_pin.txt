[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
King Pins need kilos, junkies they need brilo
Brick squad cool, otherside of the pillow
Nah I can't fold, money longer than limo
Ice game cold they know we sub zero
Ask your baby bro he say I'm his hero
Fat bankroll you think we play Cee Lo

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
My mama can't prepare me man it's unpreparable
Cross brick squad my nigga is unrepairable
Gucci Flocka bloodline thick we inseparable
And I don't give a damn you broke cause I ain't helping you
Knock up will amaze you shoes damn special bro

Who's that at my door oh that's a regular
Hey won't remember the sound but what I'm ballin' for

And Gucci keep the hammer with him like he a carpenter
