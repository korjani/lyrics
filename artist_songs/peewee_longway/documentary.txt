Ever since I seen that Big Meech documentary
I put bags on every block that he done mention [x2]
[Peewee:]
Mention my name! so many narcotics they tryna write a documentary
Narcotics, narcotics narcotics
They writing a documentary (ooh)
So many drugs they tryna write a documentary
Ever since I seen that Big Meech documentary!

[Verse 1 - Peewee Longway:]
I went to work on the block they mentioned had me
Chucking the block at the penetenary
Most don't know what's in the pantry
Loaded with bricks for the 10 a key
I got a vato in Tennessee
He say I remind him of meechie
So many racks in my denim jeans
They tryna write a documentary
I might just go kick it like L'po
Swervin' off in a new Lambo
That Big Meechie documentary
I'm feeling like I'm the new Pablo
Bricks on bricks in my Tahoe
I'm really making birdies fly ho
You didn't get it in my bio
Invented the cinco de mayo
I used to get it in Ohio
Trapping 80 baby 'round the equator
Tell me yo bitch and deny her
If she was a stripper then she was my ho
Looking at Big Meechie all on the flyer
She don't wanna go then that's when I buy her
The first young nigga with a louboutin tire
I been kicking shit that you see on the wire
So many narcotic narcotic narcotic
Working the fuck out the drop top
Watching the Big Meechie documentary I sold 150 bricks in a hour
More money came it brought me the power
Making sick suckers get kill't by hour
[?] allogator in my house I told my bitch I want a taste of the wild

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
The bricks on the way that's a 10-4
Money come in on the envelope
I'm fucking yo' bitch she a nympho
I gave her a molly she asked for mo'
Finessing the plug I said bingo!
I keep the blow boy that's no C-4
My plug he got a casino
In the basement he stashin' burritos
The man with the money
The man with the power
My lokos got powder on it
You an informant
My mention got Louie V garments
My plug is a alien martian
We not like the average, bricks in the wall
Them molly got on me [?]
Ain't leaving the trap till I sell it all
Extortin' lil niggas I send 'em off
I bag up the work then I send it off
Queen latifa you niggas I set it off
Jugging the plug that's a cake walk
Peewee longway told me get that weight off
It's hot in the kitchen my shirt off
[?] and I turn it to rerock
[?] whippin' no rebok
Selling the mollies [?] make yo' jaws lock
