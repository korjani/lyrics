(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup d'jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour

Afraid that no-one around me
Understands my potato
Think I'm only a spud boy
Looking for a real tomato

(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup d'jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour

Afraid nobody around here
Understands my potato
I think I'm only a spud boy
Looking for a real tomato

(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup d'jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour

Afraid nobody around here
Comprehends my potato
Guess I'm just a spud boy
Looking for that real tomato

We're Smart Patrol
Nowhere to go
Suburban robots that monitor reality
Common stock
We work around the clock
We shove the poles in the holes
(shove it)

Wait a minute, something's wrong
He's a man with a plan
He's here to do us a favor
A little human sacrifice
It's just supply and demand

Mr Kamikaze
Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert
Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze 
Here to spread some genes

Wait a minute, something's wrong
He's a man with a plan
His finger's pointed at Devo
Now we must sacrifice ourselves
So many others may live
Oh baby we got a lot to give

This monkey wants a word with you!

Mr Kamikaze
Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert
Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze 
Here to spread some genes

One, two, three, four
