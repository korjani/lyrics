Hey, come back Jonee 
Gotta come back now, Jonee 
Hey, come back, Jonee 

Jonee be good 
Treat her like you should  
You made her cry 

Jonee, you're bad 
You're gonna make her sad 

Jonee went to the pawnshop 
Bought himself a guitar 
Now he's gonna go far 

You gotta love 'em and leave ‘em 
Sometimes you deceive ‘em 
You made her cry 

Jonee, you're bad 
You're gonna make her sad 

As for the teardrops 
Jonee jumped in his Datsun 
Drove out on the expressway 

Went head-on into a semi 
His guitar is all that's left now 
He made her cry 

And she calls his name 
Jonee, you're to blame 
Come back Jonee 

Hey, come back Jonee 
You've gotta come back now, Jonee, Jonee, Jonee 
Hey, come back Jonee 

Oh, Jonee be good 
Treat her like you should 
You made her cry 

Jonee you're bad 
You're gonna make her sad 
Come back Jonee 

Well, come back Jonee 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
Jonee, Jonee, Jonee 
(Jonee, Jonee) 

You gotta come back now, Jonee 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
Well, Jonee be good 
(Jonee, Jonee) 

Treat her like you should 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
You made her cry 
(Jonee, Jonee) 

Well, Jonee you're bad 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
You're gonna make her sad 
(Jonee, Jonee) 

(Jonee, Jonee) 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
(Jonee, Jonee) 

(Jonee, Jonee) 
(Jonee, Jonee) 
(Jonee, Jonee)
