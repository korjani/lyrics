We like explosions that leave you feeling good
We like ideas that change the world for good

There's nothing past the stop 'n' go
There's nothing but the ebb and flow
There's nothing like some in and out
There's nothing more than what you know

Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!

We like new places that jets can't take you to
We do like music when it does what it should do

There's nothing past the stop 'n' go
There's nothing but the ebb and flow
There's nothing like some in and out
There's nothing more than what you know

Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!

Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)

We like explosions - it's only right we should
We like ideas we thought you understood
We like new places until they're overrun
We do like music - loud shots from the big spudgun

Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!

Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)

Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
