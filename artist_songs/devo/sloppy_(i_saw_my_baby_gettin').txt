I saw my baby yesterday 
Saw my baby yesterday 
She spent her money on a car 
Spent her money on a brand new car 

It didn't get her very far 
You know it didn't get her very far 
So my baby said to me 
You know my baby said to me 

You know my baby 
She said sloppy 
She said sloppy 
She said sloppy 

I think I missed the 
Hole, la 
Hole, la 
Hole, laaaa 

She said sloppy 
She said sloppy 
She said sloppy 

I think I missed the 
Hole, la 
Hole, la
