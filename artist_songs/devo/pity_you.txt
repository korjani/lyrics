Pity you 
You're telling me you've got a problem
A nervous sort of contraction 
A mindless kind of reaction 
You never get no satisfaction

Here's to you 
I know you really got a problem
A nasty kind of reflection 
A dangerous sort of destruction 
That makes it difficult 
Makes it hard to reach 
Takes it all away 
From what you had in mind 

Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Here's to you 
I know you really got a problem (problem)
A nervous kind of distraction (distraction) 
A mindless sort of reaction (reaction) 
A nasty sort of contraction (contraction) 
You never get no satisfaction (satisfaction)

But there's some big fat point that you
Seem to be missing and it's 
Driving you
To destruction 
But doesn't seem 
To stop you in the least 
Or halt this obsession got you 
Going on back 
Week after week (week after week) 
Day after day (day after day) 
Hour after hour (hour after hour) 
From where you came 
For more of the same
Yeah, yeah
