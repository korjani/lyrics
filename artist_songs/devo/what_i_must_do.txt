I used to plan and plot
And try to live correct
Lately I do a lot
Of things that don't make sense

Now I must
Do what I must

Now why do you
Think that a man
Jumps out of the frying pan
Into the fire
When he can
Find a way not to get burned

I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he's gonna get it

Below the sky above
Beyond what's good and true
Something as loud as love
Falls out, I can't refuse

Now I must
Do what I must

Now why do you
Think that a man
Jumps out of the frying pan
Into the fire
When he can
Find a way not to get burned

I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he might regret it

I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he's gonna get it
