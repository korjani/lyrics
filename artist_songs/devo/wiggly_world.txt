They say the fittest shall survive 
Yet the unfit may live 
Let 'em wear gaudy colors 
Or avoid display 
Hey it don't matter 
It's all the same

So I do this and I do that 
So I do this and I do that
So I do this and I do that

It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down

Oh you got a nickel 
I got a dime 
I'd like to get to know you 
But I haven't got the time 
You gotta walk like a mannequin 
Roll like a tire 
Act on reaction 
Dodge the big spud fryer 
So wiggle on the bottom 
Wiggle on the top 
Wiggle up the middle 
And laugh a lot 
Cause I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world, a wiggly world 
I got to tell you 
I've been living in a wiggly world now 
Wiggly world, a wiggly world 
Well I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world, a wiggly wor/d 
I got to tell you 
I've been living in a wiggly world 
WiggIy world, a wiggly world

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Yeah I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world 
Oh I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world 
Well I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world 
Well I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world 
Well I've been living in a wiggly world 
Wiggly world 
Well I've been Iiving 
In a wiggly world now 
Wiggly world 
Well I've been living in a wiggly world 
wiggly world 
Oh, I've been living in a wiggly 
Wiggly world
