She's out of sync
And everyone around her know that something is wrong
She's out of sync
She's got all the symptoms of a girl who skipped a beat
She's out of sync
A piece of ancient history, she's a walking mirage 
She's out of sync
She entered through the exit and never stopped to think

She's out of sync - she's a half step behind
She's out of luck - her body split from her mind
She's out of orbit - she'll never connect
She'll run out of time before she accepts she's out of sync

She's out of sync - (SYNC)
She's out of sync - (SYNC)

She's out of sync
And everybody senses there's a distance to keep
She's out of sync
And totally committed to living in a dark age
She's out of sync
She's constantly undoing what's already been done
She's out of sync
Trapped in a silent movie and she's on the brink

She's out of focus - she's a warp in time
She's discontinued a break in the line
She's out of orbit - she'll never connect
She'll run out of time before she accepts she's out of sync

She's out of sync - (SYNC)
She's out of sync - (SYNC)

She's out of sync
And everyone around her know that something is wrong
She's out of sync
She's got all the symptoms of a girl who skipped a beat
She's out of sync
A piece of ancient history, she's a walking mirage 
She's out of sync
She entered through the exit and never stopped to think

She's out of sync - she's a half step behind
She's out of luck - her body split from her mind
She's out of focus - she's a warp in time
She's discontinued a break in the line
She's out of orbit - she'll never connect
She'll run out of time before she accepts she's out of sync
