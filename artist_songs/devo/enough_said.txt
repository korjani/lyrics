None of you would help me when I baked by bread 
Now all of you would help me eat it 
I can see that you are very well fed 
This indicates that you don't need it

Stop and let me tell you what tomorrow holds for you 
Stop and let me tell you 'bout a plan I have for you 

Take all the leaders from around the world 
Put them together in a great big ring 
Televise it as the lowest show on earth 
And let them fight like hell to see who's king 
Enoooough saaaaaid...

Gather up the pieces when the fight is done 
Then you'll find out living really can be fun 

The next thing I say to you will be true
The last thing I said was false
Remember to do nothing when you don't know what to do

Enoooough saaaaaid...

You wanted a world you could figure out 
But something happened while you were asleep 
You wanted a good life you could brag about 
Too bad they took the parts you wanted to keep
