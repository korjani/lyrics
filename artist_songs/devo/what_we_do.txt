What we do is what we do
What we do is what we do
What we do is what we do
What we do is what we do

What we do is what we do
It's all the same, there's nothing new
What we do is what we do
It's turnin' 'round on me and you
What we do is what we do
Just different names, it's nothing new
What we do is what we do
'Cause all we do is what we do

Don't do what I do, just do what I say!
"My door does what I say - I say 'open' and it does!"
"My lights do what I say - I say 'on' and they snap on!"
"My car does what I say - I say 'start' and it jumps out!"
"But my dog doesn't do what I say."
"My girl doesn't do what I say."
"My mind doesn't do what I say."
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!"

What we do is what we do
It's all the same, there's nothing new
What we do is what we do
It's turnin' 'round on me and you
