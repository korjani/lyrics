Left home with a friend of mine
Gone two years and I don't know why
Now I'm happy all the time
I can't think and I'm feeling fine
Girl put me in a situation
I'm going through soft core mutation

Think you've heard this all before
Now you're gonna hear some more
I know a place where dreams get crushed
Hopes are smashed, but that ain't much
Voluntary experimentation
Going through soft-core mutation

I'm going under

Down under where the lights are low
To a place where all the mutants go 
Doing things I never did before
Inside out and coming back for more
Little girl with the full red lips
Never knew it could be like this
You put me in a situation
Going through soft-core mutation

I'm going under
