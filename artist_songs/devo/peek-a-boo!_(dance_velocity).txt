Peekaboo
I can see you
And I know what you do

So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Peekaboo

The way that we weren't
Is what we'll become
So please pay attention
While I show you some
Of what's about to happen

Peekaboo
I know what you do
Cause I do it too

So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Peekaboo

Laugh if you want to or say you don't care
If you can not see it, you think it's not there
It doesn't work that way

Peekaboo
I can see you
And I know what you do

So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Peekaboo
