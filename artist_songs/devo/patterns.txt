Patterns all around you
Patterns everywhere
Patterns of behavior sometimes seem unfair
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

Patterns unfamiliar
Patterns lead you through (to)
Patterns of discovery tracing out the clues 
Can you recognize the patterns that you find stuck in your mind?

In this land where stability is hard to find
You can rearrange the patterns so unkind
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries
Old patterns never die - they just go on and on

Patterns multiplying
Redirect our view
Endless variations
Make it all seem new
Can you recognize the patterns that you find stuck in your mind?

In this land where stability is hard to find
You can rearrange the patterns so unkind
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries
Old patterns never die - they just go on and on
