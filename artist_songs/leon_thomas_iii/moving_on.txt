[Verse 1:]
Here's a letter to my ex
I wish you the best
And there's alotta things I gotta get up off my chest
I'm movin' to the next
Life with no regrets
Cause when I'm with you girl, I'm not at my best
I know I should have called
But I didn't wana make it hard
I know how you get when you mad
So I painted how I feel on this pen and pad

[Hook:]
Baby by the time you get this ill already be gone, I
Be gone
Couldn't say it to ya face so I had to write it down in
This song
Ooo I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on
Without you
I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on
Without you

[Verse 2]
This letter to my ex
Figured I address
A couple of problems that a run away ya next
Like checkin' all his text and askin' where he been
I know you don't wana deal with that again
I know I should have called
But I didn't wana make it hard
I know how you get when you mad
So I painted how I feel on this pen and pad

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No part of me wants to say good-bye in the beginning of
This sentence
(No part of me wants to say good-bye in the beginning
Of this sentence)
But this is the end
OOH this is the end
This is the end
This is the end

[Hook]
