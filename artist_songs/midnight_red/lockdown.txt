[Verse 1]
Baby, when I'm with ya,
I can't describe the feeling,
All I know is that you're in control of me
Girl, you got something different,
than all the other women
I can't deny that you got a hold on me

[Hook]
(I don't wanna lose you)
Girl, without you I don't (know)
What to do or where to (go)
I just gotta let you know

(I will never hurt you)
You ain't gotta worry (no)
You can let your problems (go)
Just so you know

[Chorus]
I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape

I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape

[Verse 2]
I just can't be without you,
whenever I'm around you (I shut down)
No matter where I'm supposed to be
And girl when I'm not with ya (you know that I miss you)
Oh, I'll be there whenever you call on me

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Baby, I don't ever wanna leave you, no)
No (no)
No (no)
Hey (no) I will never leave you
(Baby, I don't ever wanna leave you, no)
No (no)
No (no)
Hey, I don't wanna let you go
(Baby, I don't ever wanna leave you, no)
No (no)
No (no)
No (no)
No (no)
(Baby, I don't ever wanna leave you, no)
No (no)
No (no)

[Chorus]
I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape

I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape
