I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
Most of my days I spend alone.
A thousand miles,
From the place I was born.
But when she wakes me,
She takes me back home.

Now, most days,
I spend like a child.
Who’s afraid of ghosts in my mind.
I know, there ain’t nothing out there.
I’m still afraid to turn on the lights.

I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
Most of my days I spend alone.
A thousand miles,
The place I was born.
When she wakes me,
She takes me back home.

A thousand miles,
The place I was born.
When she wakes me,
She takes me back home.

I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
Although now,
Most of my days I spend alone.
A thousand miles,
From the place I was born.
When she wakes me,
She takes me...
Yeah, when she wakes me,
She takes me back home.
When she wakes me,
She takes me back home.
