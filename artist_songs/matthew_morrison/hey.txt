I wonder if she's here with someone
A girl like that can get attention I could just go walking her way
All I've got to do is figure out the words I need to say

[Chorus]
Woo ooh, woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh, woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh, woo ooh
Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is

Hey hey I gotta be with you,
Hey hey
You're beautiful in every
Way way
So what I need to say is
Hey hey
And change the world in a day

In your eyes I see you're lonely Look at me,
I want you only
We belong together, this I know
Just gotta find the words to tell you so

[Chorus]

I have my lines and story set
You look at me and I forget
Thoughts are running through my head
Jumbled up and left unsaid

Woo ooh, woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh, woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh, woo ooh
Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is

Hey hey I gotta be with you,
Hey hey

Woo ooh, woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh, woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh, woo ooh
Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is

Hey hey
So what I need to say is
Hey hey
And change the world in a day
