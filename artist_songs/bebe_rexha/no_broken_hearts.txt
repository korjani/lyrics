[Bebe Rexha (Nicki Minaj):]
Oh baby, oh baby I know that you've been hurting
(This is a star studded collaboration)
Oh baby, oh baby I know that you've been hurting
(I'm Nicki Minaj, that's Bebe, let's go)

[Bebe Rexha:]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks pour it up
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight

We going straight to Miami
Hop on a plane don't need no plans
Shining so hard like a Grammy
Forget all the players what they did
We gonna be buying the drinks, we gonna be buying the drinks
Line off the bottles, line off the models, we gonn' forget everything

Oh ain't nobody going home, you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel a thing, just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely, better let me hear you sing

No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks pour it up
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life (Hold up), so let's go hard till the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks pour it up
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight

We gonna do it real biggie
Sky is the limit in this town
We taking over the city
We too high to bring us down
We gonna do what we do, we gonna do what we do
Three in the morning, four in the morning, meet you for eggs in the morning

Oh ain't nobody going home, you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel no shame, just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely, better let me hear you sing

No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks pour it up
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard till the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks pour it up
Cause we gon get it poppin' tonight

[Nicki Minaj:]
Ay yo Bebe, anybody hating need pee pee
Sip a little mix, pop pills till I'm sleepy
I'm the one that bust it open out in Waikiki
Pull up in the Ghost I'm creepy
They don't want beef we proved it
Niggas better keep it on wax like a Q-tip
Keep his dick wetter than the cruise ship
Flower than a tulip, flyer than your new bitch
I do's it, yup I'm up two zip
Girls is my sons I'm giving them milf tease
They be sweating me headbands and gym tees
Like bad knees on Dirk Nowitzki
It is going down like M. Lewinsky
Wrist freeze yep my wrist on pink skis
Ring finger be shitting on my pinky's
Make em mad aww man I got them hating bad
Bloodclaat money green like Jamaican flags
