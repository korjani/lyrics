Numb me down to the core
Cause love don't live here anymore
And we fought hard but we lost the war
Without you, what am I living for?

And I know I can't take back, all the things are dead
But if I had one wish, I would wish for one more chance

Somewhere our fear took all control
That's when I turned cold
Won't you give me one more chance?

Cause I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Drove to your house in the night
Couldn't sleep 'til I made it right
I'm sorry for all the pain
For lovin' you in vain

And I know I can't take back, all the things are dead
But if I had one wish, I would wish for one more chance

Cause I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

So I'll leave the night light on
In hopes that you will find your way
And make it, safely home
And in the eye of the storm
Our love will be the only thing
That keeps us holding on

Cause I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
