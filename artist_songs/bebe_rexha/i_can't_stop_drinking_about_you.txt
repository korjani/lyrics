No ones gonna love you like I do.
No ones gonna care like I do.
And I can feel it in the way that you breathe.
I know you dream of her while you sleep next to me.

I can't stop drinking about you.
I gotta numb the pain.
I can't stop drinking about you.
Without you I ain't the same.
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever!
So pour a shot in my glass cause it makes everything better!

Darlin tell me what more can I do?
Don't you know that I was meant for you?
You say I feel like heaven on earth,
But You'd never know what heaven was if it wasn't for... her.

I can't stop drinking about you.
I gotta numb the pain.
I can't stop drinking about you.
Without you I ain't the same.
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever!
So pour a shot in my glass cause it makes everything better!

I can't stop drinking about you.
I can't stop drinking about you.

No ones gonna love you like I do.

I can't stop drinking about you.
I can't stop drinking about you.

So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever!
So pour a shot in my glass cause it makes everything better!

No ones gonna love you like I do.
