Baby, can you see I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now

[Chorus:]
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
The taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now

[Chorus:]
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
The taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic (Toxic, toxic, toxic)
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic (Toxic, toxic, toxic)
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
