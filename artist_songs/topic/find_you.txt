When I'm looking for colors
When I'm stuck in a world of grey
There's a part of me pointing to you like a compass
Every inch of your body is
Like it's pencilled into my brain
And I carry you around like you fit in my pocket

And nothing, and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Yeah, nothing and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Cause I see you shining through

No, I don't get lost
And it's all because
I know that I'll find you
Yeah, when the skies get dark
You're my Northern Star
And I know that I'll find you
Find you, find you
And I know that I'll find you
I know that I'll find you

There's a place I can go to
All I need is to close my eyes
And I'm back at a time when we never got older
I can feel your lips on me
Like we're still living in paradise
And you whisper in my ear like your hand's on my shoulder

And nothing, and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Yeah, nothing and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Cause I see you shining through

No, I don't get lost
And it's all because
I know that I'll find you
Yeah, when the skies get dark
You're my Northern Star
And I know that I'll find you
Find you, find you
And I know that I'll find you
I know that I'll find you
