I'm leaving Virginia
Back to where I belong
I can't remember
The last time I gone

There's blue skies and women
And liquor so strong
Angels and Devils
To carry me on

[CHORUS:]
So come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

Old worn out feelings
And yesterday's news
Just give me something
That I can use

My boots are forgiven
The valley's a lie
And all these words talking
Mean nothing tonight

[CHORUS:]
So come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

I left my pillar
Out on the road
It's a desolate place
But you've been there before

There's a town by the river
It's where I was born
And I died on a hillside
All tattered and torn

[CHORUS:]
So come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

So come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight
