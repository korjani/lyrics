Radio free fall 
The cat walk to the show 
All bets are on for those in the known 
Oh no 
There's a caterwaul in Hollywood
Who would have ever thought 
All planets in line with the disco ball
Who did you know coming up 
Who will you know going down
America give it a name 
Call it a miracle 
All bets are on for those on a roll
Oh no 
Sold and bought straight San Jo
Who would have ever thought 
We'd spoil the sport and be on top
Who did you know coming up 
Who will you know going down 
Who's getting sent back down
There's a brand spanking new kid in town
San Jo who would've ever thought 
Hollywood get yourself sold and bought 
Radio, radio video and don't forget the talking show
And never forget that you're good to go 
Oh no 
It's a cattle call
In fifteen minutes you're a Neanderthal 
All planets in line with the disco ball

[Repeat Chorus]
