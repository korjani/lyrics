Whatever happened to that old visage
Reaping around in Tinseltown at large
Are you broken down at the boulevard garage
Or just another Hollywood mirage

A cast of a thousand spirits tell their tale
A cast of a million study their portrayals
Taking roll they come and go stand
Buried in the hills above movie land

I grow to bare a likeness to the diamonds
Leaving crumbs along my trail
Absolutely I salute you
It's so hard to swallow you're harder to follow
(Harder to follow)

Whatever happened to that golden song
Of wartime whittles and a wasted bag of bonds
I turn the dial in hopes for a capsule of time
Whatever happened to that simple line

Something about her moon and stars and
promises and broken hearts
Little towns and city lights
Solider boys, civillian wives
Pin cars, prohibition laws
Feast boy to worthy cause
You love him and I love you and

I'd love to bare a likeness to the diamonds
Leaving crumbs along my trail
Absolutely I salute you
It's so hard to swallow you're harder to follow
(Harder to follow)

Whatever happened to that old visage
Reaping around in Tinseltown at large
Are you broken down at the boulevard of dreams
Movie land is yours for song it seems

I grow to bare a likeness to the diamonds
Leaving crumbs along my trail
Absolutely I salute you
It's so hard to swallow you're harder to follow
It's so hard to swallow you're harder to follow
It's so hard to swallow you're harder to follow
(Harder to follow)
