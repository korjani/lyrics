Hey L.A.

There's an automatic teller machine in the emergency room
There's a meter maid she arrives by broom
There's a bear in the air with a lullaby
And a big brown coat to keep you warm at night

There's a money tree
And the ladder leans up against the trunk
But the steps are greased

Hey L.A.
Where you from
Where have you gone now
Well it looks like someone's spaceship crashed
In Babylon

There's a plastic man with a plastic knife
In a rubber hand at a drastic price
Don't miss this show you will be amazed
You're a shining star, a needle in the haze
There's a man upstairs
With the fire below
There's the elevator
And away you go

Hey L.A.
Where you from
Where have you gone now
Well it looks like someone's spaceship crashed
In Babylon

There's a smooth operator
There's a famous Governator
Everybody walks in L.A.
On a backward escalator

It's a soul terminator
It's a sea of alligators
On each and every corner
There's a broken hearted waiter

Hey L.A.
Where you from
Where have you gone now
Well it looks like someone's spaceship crashed
In Babylon
