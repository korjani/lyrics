[CHORUS]
Sister Psychic won't you tell me does it ever get better
Can you really see the future or just predict the weather
Are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
Use your super powers and rescue me 
We were there at the start we've got Polaroids to prove it
Skateboards and scars and embarrassing home movies
But if you really wanna see where it's all goin'
Switch on your TV she's all tellin', all knowin'
She knows everything

[CHORUS]
Sister Psychic, won't you tell me does it ever get better
Can you really see the future or just predict the weather
Are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
Use your super powers and rescue me

Can you help us find the ones on the missing posters
Is my baby being true, am I doin' what I'm supposed to
Could you help me find my keys or better yet life's meaning
Are those tarot or dialogue cards that you're reading
C'mon
Tell me everything

[CHORUS]
Sister Psychic, won't you tell me does it ever get better
Can you really see the future or just predict the weather
Are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
Use your super powers and rescue me

[INSTRUMENTAL]

[BRIDGE]
Sister, why would I tell you my deepest, dark secrets
So you could take my diary and rip it all to pieces
Just $6.95 for the very fist minute
I think you've won the lottery that's my prediction
You know everything

[CHORUS]
Sister Psychic, won't you tell me does it ever get better
Can you really see the future or just predict the weather
Are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
Use your super powers and rescue me
Sister Psychic, won't you tell me does it ever get better
Can you really see the future or just predict the weather
Are we in our finest hour or headed for disaster
Use your super powers and rescue me
