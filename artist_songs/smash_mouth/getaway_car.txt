You caught me lookin' at ya lookin' at me
Devil on my shoulder says you're what I need
Go on baby girl you know what I like
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Sunday night

I've got a car I'll let you drive
I've got a cave where we can hide
It's 2 am do you know where you are
Getaway car

A lot of funny people in this funny world
I'm a funny man for a funny girl
You got a mini skirt, I've got a mini bar and a:
Getaway car

Ain't nothing like it
A shiny machine
If you could just drive it
I'll show you where to put the gasoline

Don't wanna do it like they do on TV
Don't wanna mess around with movies
Don't tell your daddy, don't tell the police
Let's just keep it between you and me
I'm like everybody here tonight
I've got a short fuse I just need a light
Go on baby girl you know what I want

Getaway car
