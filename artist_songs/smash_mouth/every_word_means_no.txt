Watching for a sound to lead me to where ever you go
I can't help it, I will always love you

It used to be no words could come between us
Any time was right for secret meetings
It's different now and when you speak
Every word means no, every word means no

I'm thinking of things that never come to life
Your going through some things so shallow
There's nothing to fight

It used to be no words could come between us
Any time was right for secret meetings
It's different now and when you speak
Every word means no, every word means no

I'm a slave, I'm anything, I haven't lost my way
I'm looking around in directions
'Cause all I ever thought about was you
I never noticed anything but you

Predicting, puts me down on shaky ground
I keep thinking your looking at me
Do you want me around

It used to be no words could come between us
Any time was right for secret meetings
Now and then I forget the rules have changed
You always remind me

That every word means no
Every word means no
Every word means no
Every word means no
