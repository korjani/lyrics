Hold me down 
I'm gonna fly straight to heaven
Hold me down
Don't ever let go
I've been around
You know I can't stay forever
And when I leave
I want you to know - 

When I'm finally gone, I'm gonna be gone without a trace
There's a lot of good times ahead before we're done
And on top of this list of things before I leave this place
You are my number one, yes you are my number one

Cause you can tell me lies, you know that I'd still believe you (say wha?)
Stay right here don't leave from that spot (come right back here my girl)
I can't go, you know I'm afraid to leave you
Don't you know? you're all that I've got
I'm afraid if you go you might disappear behind a mist
And I'd rather be hung from a tree or shot by a gun
And of all of these things that matter here upon my list
You are my number one, yes you are my number one

You are my number one (say so)
Trying to make it clear (good gosh)
Trying to let you know 
When you're afraid 
I'm gonna be there... 

When I'm finally gone, I'm gonna be gone without a trace
There's a lot of good times ahead before we're done
And and and on top of this list of things before I leave this place
You are my number one
Yea you are my number one
Whoa baby, said you are my number one
You are my number one
