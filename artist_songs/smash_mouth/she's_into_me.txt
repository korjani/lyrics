[Verse:]
I can’t help look in her direction,
She’s got all of my attention.
The way she says hello,
She can make it a perfect day.

She knows all the boys are talking,
About the way, the way that she is rocking
Those jeans and a t-shirt,
But she don’t look their way.

[Pre-chorus:]
She is everything and more
That this boy is looking for

[Chorus:]
‘Cause she’s got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
‘Kind of beauty that you can’t ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
She’s truly in a different league.
She’s amazing, and she’s into me.
(Doo doo)

[Verse:]
Lips like sugar-coated gumdrops,
Code red, I think she made my heart stop.
I’m gonna tell her I love her
As soon as I can catch my breath.

[Pre-chorus:]
There ain’t no way I don’t deserve, no, no,
Someone as wonderful as her.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause she’s got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
‘Kind of beauty that you can’t ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
She’s truly in a different league.
She’s amazing, and she’s into me.
(Oh yeah)

[Bridge:]
And every time I’m with her all I want the world to know is that she’s my girl.
Just like a hit record topping every one of the chart.
‘Cause I just wanna wrap my arms around her.
I swear I’ll never let her go.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause she’s got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
‘Kind of beauty that you can’t ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
She’s truly in a different league.
She’s amazing, oh she’s amazing,
Yeah she’s amazing, and she’s into me.
(Doo doo)
