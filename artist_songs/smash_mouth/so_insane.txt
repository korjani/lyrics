Have you looked at the stop watch lately?
When was the last time you clocked-in?
There is a race to be run and a song to be sung
There is a fine line wearin' thin

So don't look back the past has past
The future is comin' fast
You better make room, we're comin' through
Loud and clear

We got the hands to turn this around
We got the plan to make it go down
We got the voice fillin' this room
We got the minds, the minds that go boom
Get up get out get on that train
It's becoming so insane
This tiny blue marble is rollin' away

Have ya checked out the temperature lately
There's a fever that's about to break
There is a game to be won and a song to be sung
This is our battle cry, make no mistake

So don't look back the past has past
The future is comin' fast
You better make room, we're comin' through
Loud and clear

We got the hands to turn this around
We got the plan to make it go down
We got the voice fillin' this room
We got the minds, the minds that go boom
Get up get out get on that train
It's becoming so insane
This tiny blue marble is rollin' away

So don't look back the past has past
The future is comin' fast
You better make room, we're comin' through
Loud and clear

We got the hands to turn this around
We got the plan to make it go down
We got the voice fillin' this room
We got the minds, the minds that go boom
Get up get out get on that train
It's becoming so insane
This tiny blue marble is rollin' away

We got the hands to turn this around
We got the plan to make it go down
We got the voice fillin' this room
We got the minds, the minds that go boom
Get up get out get on that train
It's becoming so insane
This tiny blue marble is rollin' away
