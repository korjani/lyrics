Walking out of the door I'm on my way can you tell me just where I'm going
Occupational skills would you give me a clue what to do cause my minds in motion
Just trying to relax I find myself on the couch with big plans but there's always tomorrow
Is something wrong with me or the way that I'm thinking
Come on Come on and tell me why you're staring 
Come on Come on it must be what I'm wearing 
Come on Come on and tell me why's it taking so long for you to recognize and stop
Another day in the sun I'm having fun feel the heat sneaking up on me
I take a look in the sky a plane goes by is that the reason that I can't breathe
I take a look and I wonder why, why these birds don't fly
It's hard for me to see and I believe my oh my

[Chorus]
I took a trip to the bar does my money go far can you show me just how to spend it
Moving around I like the sound I find myself looking pretty stupid
If I had a gal she'd be in a dress I better slow my drinking down
If I don't get it together tonight they're gonna run me out of town

[Repeat Chorus]
