Hey, so you wanna play?
You'll see my game's on fire
But we don't play the same game
You'll see I'm crazy for speed
And neutral means nothing to me
So if that's your desire
We'll get along famously

But one thing: I like to lead

I light 'em up before the motor starts
I go so fast that I could never stop
Look under the hood but you don't know what I got
I'm a moving violation baby, hot hot hot hot

Highway, that's my scene
I may look like a blur when you see me
And I'm flirting with disaster, I'm the master of G's
Gonna pass ya, gonna pass ya, blast some dust your way

Well you got skills and something to prove
But you're in my way so you better move
One foot on the pedal but never on the brake
So don't give me a reason, I got a license to race
