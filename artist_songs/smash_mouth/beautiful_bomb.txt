Your asteroids bounce off her like a trampoline
Sometimes all she can do is shake
Lookin' out for you and I and all she sees
Is everybody makin' big mistakes 
Takin' what they should just leave
It's given away for free now

Beautiful bomb
It's so beautiful

Fools talkin' 'bout there's enough room for just one of us
Sometimes all I can do is laugh
But the joke is getting tired and old and dangerous
And the ink ran out on the laugh-o-meter graph
I suggest you fire your staff
It's getting so obnoxious

Beautiful bomb 
We're living on a beautiful bomb
We're living on a beautiful bomb
It's so beautiful
