Leave me alone I'm over it 
And everybody's movin' on 
I can't see my tomorrow and yesterday has come and gone
So leave me alone
My mind is blown but it's my own 
So deal with it
I'm feeling fine most the time 
I may be on the outside but no ones getting in 
So leave me alone
We're O.K. reelin' in the days
We're alright we're just getting high
Let us be it'll be all right
I got no strife I'm loving life 
Could you say the same 
You don't have to move to groove 
So come on up and see me but leave that judge behind 
'Cause I'm loving life

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

I'm gettin' stoned and what's wrong with that 
The president seems to be just fine
Come on up and see me 
Come on up just know that I'm gettin' stoned
I'm gettin' stoned I'm gettin' stoned I'm gettin' stoned

[Repeat Chorus]
