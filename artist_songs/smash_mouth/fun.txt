It's 2003
And where do you wanna be?
Back in '42 or 1970?
And maybe we should just take a look around
I don't get why the planet is so upset
Don't do something you might regret
I'm telling you it's starting to get in the way

Let's have some fun
While we're still young
Turn up the sound
Til your feet leave the ground
Let's drive the car
Til we've gone too far
Then we'll pick up the pieces
And push it back home

Let's start with liberty's broken heart
And NYC could never be torn apart
It could be one world, not three
Girlfriend, kiss his very soul
Boyfriend, tell her she's beautiful
And family man, say baby mama it's OK
