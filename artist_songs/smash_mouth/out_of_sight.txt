Paintings of dogs playing pool
Smokin' cigarattes they drink 'til they drool
Well we ain't so dumb, just numb
And tomorrow's another year
Could you tell us what happened 'cause we weren't here
We've been hitchin' a ride with a big fake rubber thumb 

[CHORUS]
And you're a star now, blinkin' bright
And you drive so fast now, out of sight

The ticker tape wants us to fail
And the limousine just drives us to jail
And the concierge can't tell us where the ladies dance
But you are my friend in miles
Radio waves, stations, and dials, and smiles
Cities and towns, slow down

[CHORUS]
And you're a star now, blinkin' bright
And you drive so fast now, out of sight
Out of sight
Out of sight

[INSTRUMENTAL (haunting)]

[CHORUS]
And you're a star now, blinkin' bright
And you drive so fast now, out of sight
Out of sight
Out of sight
Out of sight
