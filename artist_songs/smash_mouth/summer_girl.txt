Summer girl, melting me
Hopelessly drifting out to sea
Let me take you to the old arcade
I got a pocket full of sandy change

Don't know much but I have a clue
You've never owned a pair of shoes
When winter comes, promise me
You'll keep me warm and always be

My summer girl, ever brown
You're laughing as I'm sinking down
Behind your shades, do you know
How to save a drowning soul

Sunny days are way too long
I'm out of place where you belong
When darkness falls, promise me
You'll keep me warm and always be 
My summer girl

The leaves are slowly turning golden brown
I'll be here when you get back into town

Don't know much but I have a clue
You've never owned a pair of shoes
When winter comes, promise me
You'll keep me warm and always be
My summer girl
