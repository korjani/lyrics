Road man driving in the road van
He's got to beat the clock to the next town
Road man driving in the road van
I set up the sound system for the band
Road man slow it down
And you will get there safe and sound 
He says no no no the show must go on
Road man driving like a mad man 
Breaking land speed records in the van 
Road man he don't mind police man
Leaving a trail of ripped up citations 

[Chorus]
Road man heavy load 
He's got to stop and smell the rose
Road man he says no go
I've got to be the king of the road
Road man didn't see the train man 
Until it was too late to slow the van
Meanwhile the band is waiting for the Road man 
Who was crushed by his beloved sound system

[Chorus]
