Tell me why we're all gluttons for pain 
The girl is totally insane 
She doesn't know the meaning of tame
Still I can't put out the flame
Hey hey I wanna play on the team that you despise 
Every day a new disguise 
Every night a Halloween 
She says keep the motor runnin' man 
Like I was some machine 
You can talk talk but I?m keepin' her stock 
I wouldn't even change a thing 
Why fight you've got me roped and tied
I hit your baited line 
I'm so diggin' your scene
I said you're playing with my head
I could split instead
I'm so diggin' your scene
On you like a hungry tick 
Like a junkie knows he ought to kick
But I don't want to be dope sick 
So I scramble for a fix
Voodoo and sorcery too I can't shake your freaky spell 

[Repeat Chorus]

Can anybody tell me why we're Springer bound 
Why we feel so up when we're kept down 
On a short leash behind a barbed wire fence
With no chance of parole on a life sentence 
My friends tell me I should run 
They say they think she's got a gun
But that just only turns me on 
Right on Right on Right on
Hey hey I wanna play for the team that you despise

[Repeat Chorus]
