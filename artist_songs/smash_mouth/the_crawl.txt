Hey cousin, I know you
Not long ago in the city zoo
You haven't changed
You still ain't standin' up straight
And I been thinkin' 'bout what we've become
Or what we haven't, just look what we've done

Still making fire out of sticks and stones
Standing united all together alone

Do the crawl, do the crawl, do the crawl
Back into the woods
Do the slide, do the slide, yeah you and me
Back into the sea

Hey sister how you been
Last time you saw me I was wearing a fin
Times haven't changed, I'm still swimmin'
Got to the top to get myself some air
I realized that it was better down there

It's like a jungle but there ain't no laws
No helping hands just grubby paws

Do the crawl, do the crawl, do the crawl
Back into the woods
Do the slide, do the slide, yeah you and me
Back into the sea

My naked eye saw a fly in a jar with a hole in the lid
To tell his kid exactly where not to go
I saw the puppet string screwed into his head
I heard the puppet lie
I felt the banner shred
I can smell the smoke
As well as a rat
I can teach that dog
I can learn from a cat
Throw it in reverse
So I can hit erase
I can taste the blood

Do the crawl, do the crawl, do the crawl
Back into the woods
Do the slide, do the slide, yeah you and me
Back into the sea
