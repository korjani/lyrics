Why don't you condone it
Why don't you set me free
I don't think you own it
Cause it belongs to me
And if I ever want to take it back
You try to lie and hide it
Look who laughing last
Everyone around me thinks they know
They try to see it
But I don't let it show
Stay out of my business
Keep your hands off my door
I've got a bed
I'd rather sleep on the floor
Screaming in my head
I don't like it anymore 

No place to go
Leave me alone
I don't want to know 

I spin my wheels and try to figure it out
What's going on
And what's it all about
Where did I go wrong
I think I'm having my doubts
About what you said
And what you're going to do
I'm so pissed off
I blame it on you
I've done it all
There's nothing left for me to do
What's going on
Piss on you 

No place to go
Leave me alone
I don't want to know
