I can't imagine why you flipped me off
Did Guy Fieri really teach you how to drive
Does all your raging just make you feel alive
The faces that you're wasting while you're chasing after me
Then blowing past me way too fast to see

I have been around this block a time or two
I have felt the same way that I think you do
I can lose my mind when it don't matter
But I think that I'd just rather be cool

Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out
Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out

Hit the Playboy mansion about half past two
Couldn't help but stare at her as she dipped in the pool
That's when you lost your sh*t and took a swing at me
I wasn't intentionally disrespecting you
I was just admiring the view

I have been around this block a time or two
I have felt the same way that I think you do
I can lose my mind when it don't matter
But I think that I'd just rather be cool

Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out
Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out

Ah, look baby, here's a pill for you to chill on
Every time we partyin' you wanna get your grill on
And I understand how you feel but
No contract, no big deal
Charge it to the game - Amex
You gotta loosen up - Spandex
I could flip out any day
Whateva you're cuter when you're mad anyway

Look I don't understand why you flippin' out like this
Take a chill pill

I have been around this chick a time or two
I have felt the same way that I think you do
I can lose my mind when it don't matter
But I think that I'd just rather be cool

Whoa-oh

I have been around this block a time or two
I have felt the same way that I think you do
I can lose my mind when it don't matter
But I think that I'd just rather be cool

Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out
Whoa-oh, no use flippin' out
No use flippin' out
