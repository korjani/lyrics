I met this dude the other day at a sports bar
We had a beer and shot some pool and watched NASCAR
We talked about how everything was falling apart
But here we are now
We'll make it some how

Because the world just keeps on spinning round and round
Tell me we're so damn lost, we can't be found

How much better can it get
Ain't seen nothing yet
It's a perfect planet
How much better can it get
Haven't broke a sweat
It's a perfect planet
It's a perfect planet

So this dude he said his girlfriend left him last night
She swore it's over, never call, it was a big fight
Shake if off and go like it's all right
No more thinking, keep on drinking

Because the world just keeps on spinning round and round
Tell me we're so damn lost, we can't be found

How much better can it get
Ain't seen nothing yet
It's a perfect planet
How much better can it get
Haven't broke a sweat
It's a perfect planet

And even though it seems 
we're falling fast
It never giving up
Even though it seems 
we'll never have enough
We're still alive
So alive

How much better can it get
Ain't seen nothing yet
It's a perfect planet

Cause the world just keeps on spinning round and round
Tell me we're so damn lost, we can't be found

How much better can it get
Ain't seen nothing yet
It's a perfect planet
How much better can it get
Haven't broke a sweat
It's a perfect planet
It's a perfect planet
