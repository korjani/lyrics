I see you floating by me 
I see a beautiful face
It's pointed straight up towards the smog 
I know I know you feel me beaming 
Can you sense my burning x-ray vision
As you roll on by now
You must be gravitating 
To the vibe I'm generating or maybe not 'yet
I have known you forever 
You pushed the reset button on the counter of my heart
But you'll laugh at my advances
But still I've gotta chance it as I watch your dust
You do it You do it for me that's how I know that you are mine 
I send out to you 
Frequencies exceeding the speeding laws of sound 
I extend out to you
The satellite that will orbit your mind until your down 
That's how I know that's how I know
I'm the asteroid that will infiltrate your soul
That's how I know that's how I know
Speeding towards you burning out of control

[Repeat Chorus]
