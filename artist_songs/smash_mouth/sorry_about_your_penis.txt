I caught you looking at yourself
Don't worry about it, you look fine
How'd you get your hair so tight?
Kicking things, you might as well fight
It's January, you've got a tan
I gotta hand it to you, man
You're the bull of the ball
Trying to stand tall
Thinking you can take 'em all

Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis 

I caught you looking at yourself
I bet you've got overhead cams
Personalized plates and all
Your truck's probably ten feet tall
Bet you say you do it a lot
Bet you don't do it at all
You try to get it up
Might as well erupt
Thinking you could take 'em all

Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis

Sorry, so sorry, I'm sorry
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry 

You don't get it
You never will
Flirting with that macho overkill
Seeing everything as if it was a sport
All you'll ever win is a case of warts
Cookie cutter man, you all look alike
Drink 'em up, drink 'em up
Fight fight fight
Move it with the man
Got a tongue in cheek
Don't recreate
Please please please

Personalized plates and all
Your truck's probably 10 feet tall
Bet you say you do it a lot
Bet you don't do it at all
Can't get laid, na na na
You might as well fuck a guy up

Sorry about your penis
