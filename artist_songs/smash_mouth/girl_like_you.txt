I've been waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl like you
I'm just standing 'round
Waiting for a girl
Hanging 'round for a girl like you

You standing in a queue
Walking through the Louvre
With your mother
Hi, took me by the eye
Caught me in the hang, undercover

I've been waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl like you
I'm just standing 'round
Waiting for a girl
Hanging 'round for a girl like you

Show someone how to grow
Make a garden be out of nothing
You beating at the moon
Barking up a tree
Stark running

I've been waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl like you
I'm just standing 'round
Waiting for a girl
Hanging 'round for a girl like you

Living in a rocky world
Listen to the mockingbird
Listen when your mama says
Baby come home, real home

I've been waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl
Waiting for a girl like you
I'm just standing 'round
Waiting for a girl
Hanging 'round for a girl like you
