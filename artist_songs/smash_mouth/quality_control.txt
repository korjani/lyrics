They've swept up the rubbish
And took out the garbage
No more noise pollution in the air
Just smog

Well sooner than later
Under the radar
They're starting a revolution off the air

C.C. I've got your quality control

They've cleared up the channels
Program and progress
If you haven't noticed you have just been whored 
And turned out

Behind the receiver 
The silver deceiver
Well we ain't bending over anymore
We've tuned out

C.C. I've got your quality control

Goin' to bed with an industry death wish
On an idolless pillow 
Sleeping with the fish
The lottery winners they're all talkin'
But sayin' nothin' and soon they'll be walkin'

They've swept up the rubbish
And took out the garbage
Program and progress 
If you didn't notice
Sooner than later, under the radar
We're starting a revolution off the air

C.C. I've got your quality control
