[Verse 1:]
So many times in life before, I tried and tried to do things my way (hey, hey, hey) 
I thought that I was smart enough, I thought I knew enough to (handle my self) 
I didn't realize the problem was, the struggle was between my will and Yours 
So I'm giving up my will for Yours, I'm totally depending on You (please come through) 

[Hook:]
I have no other choice but to trust You 
That's all I can do 
I have no other choice but to believe 

[Verse 2:]
Now when trouble comes my way, I don't cry, I just lift my eyes (to the hills) 
'Cause Your word says my help is gonna come, I'm just gon rest in what You say (hey, hey, hey) 

[Bridge:]
'Cause I know every word You say is true 
And every promise that You made it will come to 
So no matter how long it takes 
I'll be here still giving praise 
Waiting on my change to come 

[Hook:]
I have no other choice but to trust You 
That's all I can do 
I have no other choice but to believe
