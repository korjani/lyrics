[Chorus:]
I got something good inside of me
Good in the hood
It's good in the hood
Good in the hood
I got something good inside of me

Everybody ain't
Sticking up cars going to bars getting drunk to fight everybody just talking junk
Everybody ain't
Walking around with baggy jeans being mean
And the lips purple 'cause we smoking trees
Everybody ain't
Trynna be tough and violent
Matter of fact I know some cats from the hood play the violin
Everybody downtown
Down frown 'cause you around
Just because you wear a suit don't mean we think u a clown
Some of us are
Going to bed about eleven got to get up real early be at work quater to seven
Some of us are
Going to school not skipping class
Didn't make the dean's list but we still goin' to pass
Some of us are
Taking good care of all our kids
Makin' sure they got clothes and something in the fridge
Some of us are
Happy with life we down with Christ
Got a good head on our shoulders and we feel alright

[Chorus: x2]
Good in the hood
It's good in the hood
Good in the hood
I got something good inside of me

Everybody ain't
Walking around carrying guns thinking it's fun
Got two and three girls carrying sons
Everybody ain't
Wearing all black and selling dope and crack
To teens and fiends whose clothes don't match
Everybody ain't
Cussin' out babies because they driving you crazy
Just maybe they miss their daddy who left them the day before
Everybody ain't
Sleeping around with everybody in town
And when you hit the college ground it's going down
Some of us are
Working in barbershops and salons
Making money, paying bills and child support every month
Some of us are
Really good people just had a crazy life
And now in jail for life with long nights
Some of us are
Going to church faithfully
Got to get it right with God before we finally leave
Some of us are
Trynna do better we trynna get it together
And when it's all said and done we tyrnna go to heaven

[Chorus: x2]
Good in the hood
It's good in the hood
Good in the hood
I got something good inside of me
