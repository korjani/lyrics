[Verse 1:]
Each and every day I will seek your face
My soul is crying out
For more, I want more of You
I won't be satisfied nor content of where I am
So I will apprehend til I'm captured by what I'm after

[Bridge:]
And I will go
From faith to faith
From glory to glory
[repeat]

[Chorus:]
And I'll forever be chasing after you
I'll be chasing after you
[repeat]

[Verse 2:]
I will press towards the mark
For the prize, and I won't faint
There's one thing I desire and that's what I'm going for
I can't continue life, day by day, growing dry
I need to be with you (Jesus) 
I'll seek where you are

[Bridge:]
And I will go
From faith to faith
From glory to glory
[x3]

[Chorus:]
And I'll forever be chasing after you
I'll be chasing after you [x7]

And I will go
From faith to faith
From glory to glory [x3]

And I'll forever be chasing after you
I'll be chasing after you
