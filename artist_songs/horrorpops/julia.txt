he's the one that always stands with a smile
She's pure and right and
Bathed in some kind of light
She's sicker than hell, but always feeling fine
The whole thing just makes me wanna cry

Hey hey Julia you're the closest thing to an angel
That I'll ever find
My friend Julia, she hasn't got a clue
But Julia always stay true

Tall as a mountain, but yet so fine
Her feet never touch ground
But that's all right
I don't understand what they're doing to her
I wanna scream she's not too good to be true

Every thing is gonna be fine
You're gonna be all righ
