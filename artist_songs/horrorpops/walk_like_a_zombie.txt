You walk like a zombie 
You talk like a zombie 
Its not in your head 
You're a living dead 
Whatever you're gonna do 
You're gonna make me cry 

And you wanna hold hands 
In the cemetery 
And you wanna be lost 
For all eternity 
And everything is dark 
And kind of scary 
And you crave the full moon 
But i don't care 

And you want a mountaintop 
With a little castle 
And you wanna name our kids 
Morticia and fester 
And all the flowers you bring 
Are always dead 
And you howl at the moon 
But i don't care 

Six feet under 
You make me wonder 
You wanna be undead 
So you can be hunted 
But whatever you're gonna do 
I'm gonna follow you
