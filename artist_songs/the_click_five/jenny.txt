She calls me baby
then she won't call me
says she adores me
and then ignores me
(Jenny, what's the problem?)

She keeps her distance
and sits on fences
puts up resistance
and builds defenses
(Jenny, what's the problem?)

You leave me hanging on the line
everytime you change your mind

[Chorus:]
First you say you won't
then you say you will
you keep me hanging on
and we're not moving on
or standing still
Jenny, you've got me on my knees
Jenny, it's killing me

She needs her own space
she's playing mind games
ends up at my place
saying that she's changed
(Jenny, what's the problem?)

I'm trying to read between the lines
you got me going out of my mind

[Chorus]

(oh oh oh)
It's killing me
(oh oh oh)
It's killing me
(oh oh oh)
Jenny

[Chorus x2]

It's killing me

Jenny
