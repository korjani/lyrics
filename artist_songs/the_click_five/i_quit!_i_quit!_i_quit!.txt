I quit
My old ways
I quit ignorin' all the things you say
Quit gettin' high
Stayin' out all night
I quit to keep you from lettin' me go
You say it's over, but I'm sayin' no!
I quit! I quit! I quit!
But I ain't givin' you up
You got that somethin' that I can't get enough of
I'd give you anything
But I ain't givin' you up
Either way, you're the fix
That's why I quit! I quit! I quit!
Give me
Another shot
Forgive me baby for the things I forgot
I'll never be
In your magazines
They got two reasons for leavin' me flat
But I got a big one for takin' me back
I quit! I quit! I quit!
But I ain't givin' you up
You got that somethin' that I can't get enough of
I'll give you anything
But I ain't givin' you up
Took a hit, you're the fix
That's why I quit! I quit! I quit!
If you knew I could change
Would it change anything?
You saw right through
You knew and now you're gone
Now you're gone.........
I quit! I quit! I quit!
But I ain't givin' you up
You got that somethin' that I can't get enough of
I'll give you anything
But I ain't givin' you up
Either way, you're the fix
That's why I quit! I quit! I quit!
That's it! That's it! I quit!
But I ain't givin' you up
You got that somethin' that I can't get enough of
I'd give you anything
But I ain't givin' you up
Took a hit, you're the fix
That's why I quit! I quit! I quit!
(I quit!)
I quit! I quit! I quit!
(That's it! I quit!)
That's it! That's it! I quit!
(I quit!)
I quit! I quit! I quit!
