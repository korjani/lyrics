When I saw her she looked my way
And I knew that I was over my head
Ruby lips on a smile so sweet
With a rude attitude that could knock me dead

(suddenly)
I heard a voice when she called my name
(suddenly)
I knew my life was gonna change

Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Ya you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me

All my friends say you lucky guy
Everyone wants to stand in your place
And so I give it another try
I'm not sure how much more my poor heart can take

(suddenly)
I feel the blood pumpin' round my brain
(suddenly)
I grab my bat and I'm back in the game

Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Ya you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me

I don't know what to do
I don't know what to say
Cause noone knows that she puts me through anyway
I'm awake in disaster
I can't seem to get past her
I try and I try but I can't get away

That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me
It's not easy to see

Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Ya you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see

Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Ya you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me
