I lost myself at your show last night
Looking at the sparkling eyes
In the middle of a fresher crowd
You keep living like you're a movie star
But tell me who you really are
When the lights go down

Baby you're a glitter doll
On the radio
I dissolve
In the stereo
You've got me
You've got me coming back for more

Pop princess hold my hand
Pop princess I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out turn me inside out
Pop princess make me smile
Pop princess drive me wild
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your love up loud

You were hiding in a darkened stall
Waiting on your curtain call
Getting your piece of mind
But I was looking past the glossy stare
I knew who was really there
And I'd like to spend some time

Baby you're a glitter doll
On the radio
I dissolve
In the stereo
You've got me
You've got me coming back for more

Pop princess hold my hand
Pop princess I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out turn me inside out
Pop princess make me smile
Pop princess drive me wild
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your love up loud

Baby girl I think you're radical
But you're a star and I'm fanatical
Can we start something new
Just between me and you

Pop princess hold my hand
Pop princess I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out turn me inside out
Pop princess make me smile
Pop princess drive me wild
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your love up loud

Pop princess oh
Pop princess oh
So baby turn your love up loud
Pop princess oh
Pop princess oh
So baby turn your love up loud
Pop princess oh
Pop princess oh
So baby turn your love up loud
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your love up loud
