I woke up early in my hotel room
Wait for my alarm to go.
I think about the things I`ve gotta do
Damn, my mind is gonna blow.
I`m freaking out, about what's ahead
Maybe I`ll just stay in bed
'Cause it`s no fun to be the one going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

You`re looking for something you can`t find
If you give it up, you`ll lose your mind
There`s always something in your way
What can you say?
You`re gonna have good day

I quit my job about a week ago
Told 'em that I need some time.
Now I`m going strong on Lexapro
Doctor says I`m doing fine.
I`m freaking out about what's ahead
Maybe I`ll just stay in bed
'Cause it's no fun to be the one going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

You`re looking for something you can`t find
If you give it up, you`ll lose your mind

Just when I thought I couldn`t lose
I realized that it's the only thing I knew

I`m freaking out about what's ahead
Maybe I`ll just stay in bed
'Cause it's no fun to be the one going out of my head
So I tell it to myself
Tell it to myself
Tell it to myself again

You`re looking for something you can`t find
If you give it up, you`ll lose your mind
There's always something in the way
