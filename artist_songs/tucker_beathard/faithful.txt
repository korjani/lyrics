It’s crazy how, my heart beats so damn loud
Holding on to feelings that need letting out
I could taste the words, yeah they burn the tip of my tongue
And there pushing against my lips
Conscience ringing, and I won’t pick up
To hear that constant “it can’t be done”
“It can’t be done”

But hey you
Let’s do, what everybody swears is just too hard to
Yeah I say, we lay
It all out on the table if you’re with me and girl, I’m able
Let’s be faithful

I hate to ask, but hell I gotta know
Do you see yourself hanging on long down the road?
Or do you see us both hanging on to hope
'Bout tangled, rope fraying on both ends
Counting on memories we stacked up, to hide the truth
'Til it caves on us
Yeah, it’ll cave on us

But hey you
Let’s do, what everybody swears is just too hard to
Yeah I say, we lay
It all out on the table if you’re with me and girl, I’m able
Let’s be faithful

Ohh oh, let's be faithful

Take the fears, take the doubts, take the “don’t knows.”
Strip’em down all the way to bare bones
Love will either be there, or it won’t

Let's be faithful

I say, we lay
It all out on the table if you’re with me and girl, I’m able
Let’s be faithful

It's crazy how, my heart beats so, damn, loud
