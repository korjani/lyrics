Killing hurts
has to be done
peace and love and
who's number one
the right to give
learn to bleed it's free
pain is outside
lift it up to see

step ahead
always wear the past
dying soothe me
beneath the smell of grass
no world secret
kept is too intent
I've got my nerve
self-help confidence

confidence
