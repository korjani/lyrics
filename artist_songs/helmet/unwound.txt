I start to feel sick whenever we talk
It's nothing medical
Ever remark you make is off the cuff
You're so unwound
It's unnatural

I know you're acting now
You're wasting time

So darling you're stalling now
I'll give you time
Darling you're worrying
I'll be alright

You look so pleased
You're right where you want to be
There's nothing clever 'bout dumb luck
I should ignore you
I'd just get bored with you
It's easier when I'm not drunk

I know you're acting now
You're wasting time

So darling you're stalling now
I'll give you time
Darling you're worrying
I'll be alright

I feel sick when you're near
I don't remember why we're here
Darling please, you're boring me
It's hard to pretend I'm listening
I might be deaf, I might be dumb
but I know that something is wrong

and darling you're worrying I'll leave you right now
