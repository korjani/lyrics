Darlin' was a hit
Started throwing punches
She connects, never gets what she wants
And she wants

She's unhinged
Swears now that was then
Just a little glitch
Patch it up again
And she wants
And she wants
And she wants

So far I don't understand this
There's no misunderstanding
There's nothing here to get
She wants more than my attention
She's not above invention
But I don't really care

It's unreal, she'll tell you what you wanna hear
Feel her infection touch you and rot
And you rot
And you rot
And you rot

So far I don't understand this
There's no misunderstanding
There's nothing here to get
She wants more than my attention
She's not above intention
But I don't really care

Don't know what you want or how far
You fall when you're unhinged
Coming back for more
I was only horny

So far I don't understand this
There's no misunderstanding
There's nothing here to get
She wants more than my attention
She's not above invention
But I don't really care
