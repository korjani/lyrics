Tell me if you think it's all right
I'll give in to what you know
I don't see the habits that
Become me
I've saved up my useless thoughts

Well means, it works I'm on your side
I said that? Well so, I lied
Remember I tried not to be wary
This failed me once too much

Unrecognized
Well preserved
Don't forget what you heard
