You know this is not real life
Are you confused?
You see yourself up
On the big screen

You ain't as large in person
You're not threatening
Did you forget
You're only acting?

How does it feel
With your hands on the wheel?
Hey, they believe in you now

The party tricks and politics
You're on TV
Nothing you've done
Has been worth watching

Where are you now?
Plant your feet back on the ground
Yeah, I'd be glad to help you down

How does it feel
With your hands on the wheel?
Hey, they believe in you

Where are you now?
Plant your feet back on the ground
Yeah, I'd be glad to help you down
Help you down
