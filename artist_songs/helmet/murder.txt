Tight security
Looks that challenge
Savage end aid food chain balance
Even the fabulous can't avoid
A random attack to pass a
Boring night

Blue habit sap my strength
Fleet of dump trucks line my street
Bludgeoned to death or shot in the head
Murder down the hall
That green monument won't prevent death

No one said, no one's safe
No one said, no one's safe
No one said, no one's safe
No one, no one's safe
