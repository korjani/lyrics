You have worked your way up to the top
Thought that you would make the whole world stop
Up to Venus, Mars and Jupiter
Bet your feet don't even touch the Earth

On your way
On your way down
On your way
You're on your way down

Stumbling drunk now with authority
You've taken all that you can take from me

On your way
On your way down
On your way
You're on your way down

Are you lying to yourself?
There's no right or wrong
No heaven and no hell
Now you're losing all your friends
To surround yourself with
All those dull "yes" men

On your way
On your way down
You're on your way
On your way down

You're on your way
