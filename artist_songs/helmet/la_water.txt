In LA sun shine's all the time
You know you might get burned
I haven't found now for a while
The weather here is always warm

And in the end the sun never rains
I'm not the only one
Evaporated in the heat
I don't need oxygen no need

And if you notice what you are
You know how to get it
You know you will get it

Man all this sun gets me so high
I reach down to the bone inside
I never go there I remained
I know I might be revived

And now I wont' freeze now
And everyday is warm
And everyday is nice

Yeah-yeah

In LA I don't move too fast
All this life just beating past
I'm out of time

The outside world does not change
Nobody notices, it's fine

And I can't leave now for awhile
And now I won't freeze now for awhile
And everyday is always warm
And everyday is always nice
