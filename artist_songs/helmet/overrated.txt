Today's another day you won't deny that
It came so slow you don't remember
When you got so fat
Up above the bathroom mirror the light'll
Make you weak but
It's that pacifying lie that grows now
Every week

And still you hate it, it's overrated

I'll never forget things like, "Who did what?"
Cover old ground and drag
What's useless up
I won't feel guilty about being late again
There's no one to answer to and
No one to hate
