It can't be hard to find a way to make your mark
Just light yourself on fire,
I'll sound a smoke alarm
Still life will pass you by
You're gone without a trace
Might slow down just enough
To spit right in your face

Goodbye and so long
Goodbye
Now it's time to say goodbye
It might be time to say goodbye

That's entertainment son
You know your death ain't news
We love an accident
Well I'd love to know it's you
I spent three dollars on
These non-stick garden gloves
So I could bury you without blistering

Goodbye, so long
Goodbye
Now it's time to say goodbye

They don't miss you at all
They think you're an asshole

Goodbye, so long
Goodbye
Now it's time to say goodbye
Might be time to say goodbye

Now it's time to say
Goodbye
