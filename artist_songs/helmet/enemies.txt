You never rid the butterflies
The hate you feel
You can't disguise
It's animal, it's chemical
It's only human
To hit so low

I know what you need
I can tell you lies and
We'll be enemies
So dissatisfied

The dirty looks. You burn inside.
You won't forget 'cause you've decided
There's someone you can blame
You can feel lily white again

I know what you need
I can tell you lies and
We'll be enemies
So dissatisfied
