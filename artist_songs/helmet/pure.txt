Affected by what you had lost
They're not the habits you'd protect
At any cost

Blur the details of your hand
Anything your barren conscience
Can't defend

The limits of attention span
Successive thoughts you don't have
But you still pretend

Keep on talking anyway
Protected by what you know
No one will ever say

Because you can't be pure
You're self-assured
