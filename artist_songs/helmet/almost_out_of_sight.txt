Don't ever show them how
That weight might drag you down
And you don't feel like trading places
Your false humility to be who they want you to be
But you can't stand their smiling faces

It's only economics, and you enjoy this
You get by
Now you're taking off
Man you are as high as a kite
Hey now you're blowing up
You're almost out of sight

Well nothing lasts forever
Try keeping it together
Your highlight reel is running short
You know they've seen it all
Like any miracle
You are as easily ignored

It's only economics, but you enjoy it
Wave goodbye, now you're taking off
Man you are as high as a kite
Hey now you're blowing up
You're almost out of sight

All these claims all made you want everybody
Just take it in
It's only economics
It's time to wave goodbye
Now you're taking off
Man you are as high as a kite
Hey now you're blowing up
You're almost out of sight

Now you're taking off
Man you are as high as a kite
Hey now you're blowing up
You're almost out of sight
