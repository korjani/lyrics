There's another sucker born
Every minute lord
Take her out and pay for a good time
You never know what you can afford
Another wreck and time to collect
more souvenirs
Gone another million miles
No words for the wear

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute lord
He deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car

I sear to god I'm
wrecking it all
Your happy end
Spin around the block in half the time
I know where you've been
Too bad you're not feeling too bad
You want to be my friend
Got another ride and you're taking off
Met a General Motor man

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute lord
He deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car
