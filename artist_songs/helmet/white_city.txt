Moving out of white city
I'm going somewhere
I won't know anybody
I don't care

A million miles away
It's too late to find heaven anyway

Moving out of white city
I've been here to long
I've seen all of these faces
I've done everything wrong

If heaven is the place
Then i must be a million miles away

Out here, a way out of here
Out here, a way out of here
Where heaven disappears
I must be a million miles away
Away, away
