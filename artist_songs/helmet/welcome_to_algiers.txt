Somebody pull the trigger
We are in business now
We'll make a killing man

I don't know why we're hated
Yeah, we got problems too
It's only filthy land

Another worthless malcontent
Another savage
Another day without regret
And all this damage

I don't feel any younger
I need someone to blame
I don't know what to wear

It's always so confusing
When lives are being destroyed
Never been anywhere, nowhere

Another worthless malcontent
Another savage
Another day without regret
And all this damage

Holy rollers, nobody's convinced
They're folding up the tents and taking off

AD, HD, over medicate
Nothing's complicated when you're lost
And we're lost

Another worthless malcontent
Another savage
Another day without regret
And all this damage
