Nobody was paying attention
Man, you had the world on the run
Everybody jump, everybody swoon
Everyone was whistling your tune

Now you're dying to make it last
But karma's burning fast

Blinded by the fireworks
Hangin' on your every word
Could not resist, did you feel like Jesus?
Gone too far, now you're so religious

Are you tired? are you sick?
Karma's burning quick
Now you're dying to make it last
Karma's burning fast

Shit

Are you tired? are you sick?
Karma's burning quick
Now you're dying, turn it around
But karma's taking you down, you down
Yeah, karma's taking you down
