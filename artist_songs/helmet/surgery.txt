There are things you never know
you need removed before
You think too much, you feel, you touch
Just cut 'em out for good

Well put me under know
Knock me out

Are you safe?
Are you sound?
Are you living in fear now?
Are you scared?
Are you falling?
Can you feel at all are you scarring now?

The false alarms you knew before
You were surgically reformed
You turned it all around
You knocked them out

Are you safe?
Are you sound?
Are you living in fear now?
Are you scared?
Are you falling?
Can you feel at all are you scarring now?

Are you falling now? 'Cause I can help you down
Now you see how it feels

Are you safe?
Are you sound?
Are you living in fear now?
Are you scared?
Are you falling?
Can you feel at all are you scarring now?
