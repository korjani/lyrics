Hey, it's late
I can barely see straight
You're barely standing out
You talk, you feel
You wanted something that's real
I am pretending now

I know that you're smart
You mentioned it before
You can read and write
I bet baby, you perform

Aim low
You just met me I know
But I feel something right now
So aim low
Just let yourself go
All I need is tonight yeah

Tonight could be kept between
You and me
I don't need to know your name
You aim is off
Just boys in here and they're soft
I'll give you something to tame

I know that you're smart
You mentioned it before
You can read and write
I bet baby, you perform

Aim low
You just met me I know
But I feel something right now
So aim low
Just let yourself go
All I need is tonight yeah
