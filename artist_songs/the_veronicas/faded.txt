I am fading fading,
I'm slipping away, as I disappear in the dark

You never take
Take the time to really look
Look at the one
The one I really am
You try to fit
To fit me in your perfect box
You let me slip
Between the cracks

[Chorus:]
Now I'm faded
Into someone else
Baby someone I don't wanna be
Yeah I'm faded
My true color's gone
Like a picture nobody sees

I bet you don't
Don't even know my favorite song
You tell me how
How I should wear my hair
You wanna change
Everything I ever was
Try to erase me
'Til I'm not there

[Chorus:]
Now I'm faded
Into someone else
Baby someone I don't wanna be
Yeah I'm faded
My true color's gone
Like a picture nobody sees

Now I'm faded
Like I never was
'Til I don't even know myself
Yeah I'm faded
Into what you want
But I'm not taking it too well

I don't wanna be your little picture-perfect-pretty-girl
Who's got nothing to say
And I'm not gonna wait around for you
To run my whole life down
I'll let you watch me fade away

You try to fit
To fit me in your perfect box
You let me slip
Between the cracks

[Chorus:]
Now I'm faded
Into someone else
Baby someone I don't wanna be
Yeah I'm faded
My true color's gone
Like a picture nobody sees

Now I'm faded
Like I never was
'Til I don't even know myself
Yeah I'm faded
Into what you want
But I'm not taking it too well

Fading, Fading,I'm sliping away
As I disappear in the dark

Fading, Fading, I'm so far away
I don't know who I was at the start

Fading, Fading,I'm sliping away
As I disappear in the dark

Fading, Fading, I'm so far away
I don't know who I was at the start
