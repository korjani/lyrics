You're a little obsessed with me 
And I'm a little bit scared of you 
The way you look and stare at me 
Maybe it's time I let you know 

You could call me six times but still I won't pick up the phone 
You could spend all your money on me
but still I'll say no 
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me 
That I am the girl of your dreams 
But nobody ever asked me 
I never looked at you that way 
'Cause I always thought you were  gay 

Every time you come around 
You just look me up and down 
And then you try to hold my hand 
I'm confused now I don't understand 

You could call me six times but still I won't pick up the phone 
You could spend all your money on me
but still I'll say no 
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me 
That I am the girl of your dreams 
But nobody ever asked me 
I never looked at you that way 
'Cause I always thought you were gay 

You told me lies 
You made me believe 
It would be fine 
If there was nothing to see 
I'd be undressing in front of you 
I told you secrets that no one else knew 

You could call me six times but still I won't pick up the phone 
You could spend all your money on me
but still I'll say no 
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me 
That I am the girl of your dreams 
But nobody ever asked me 
I never looked at you that way 
'Cause I always thought you were gay
