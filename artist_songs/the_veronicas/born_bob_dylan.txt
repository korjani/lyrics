If I don't say anything, it's wrong
If I said it, it wouldn't come out right
It's been keeping me up all night
Half my life I've been told to shut up
So how am I gonna open up?
Wish you could just read my mind

If I shared all of me
Would you run away?
If I sugarcoat what I had to say in poetry
Would it make you stay?

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And follow my heart, unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

They say... either way, you win
If you're feeling it, why you gotta hold it in?
What is meant to be will be
But all their wisdom doesn't help me now
I'm scared and I gotta find out how to speak my mind
Without metaphors and rules and rhymes
I'm still making mine
I hope you know what I mean when I'm acting mean
'Cause I don't see what I mean when I'm caught in between
And I'm afraid the real you is alluding me

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And follow my heart, unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

With you I'm ripped wide open at the seams
I'm not that tough
But you could hear the song inside of me
But it's not enough
All the things I wanna say to you
Read it on my face

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And follow my heart, unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

I wish I was born bob dylan
Even if I stood alone
Didn't know how it was gonna go
Gotta get it off my chest
And hope for the best

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
