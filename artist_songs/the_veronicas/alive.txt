Can you hear my heart it’s calling your name
I knew it from the start it felt the same
My pulse is getting faster and it's you I have to blame
It's time to give it to you straight

Down in flames we're out in space if we fall from grace well
That's the price we pay

Even if the ship goes down tonight
Even if the stars turn into ice
Promise that will make it out alive

Alive
Alive
Alive

The night is golden
I, I know that we're not fallen tonight

I see it through the dark it’s coming are way
Could tare our world apart yeah but that’s ok 
Cause we can just rebuild it with are DNA
So don’t be afraid 

Down in flames we're out in space if we fall from grace well
That's the price we pay

Even if the ship goes down tonight
Even if the stars turn into ice
Promise that will make it out alive

Alive
Alive
Alive

The night is golden
I, I know that we're not fallen tonight

Never been here before and I can’t help but feel so alive
You have opened the door you can see to the other side

Even if the ship goes down tonight
Even if the stars turn into ice
Promise that will make it out alive

Alive
Alive
Alive

The night is golden
I, I know that we're not fallen tonight
The night is golden tonight we're not fallen tonight
