'Cause I'm dying here
You were lying it was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light
And I'm dying here,
And I'm crying over you that I remember
But now you make me shiver
You're so...

Am I meant to sit here
And just take this,
When you promised me that I would be the one that you would never leave
I can't believe I fell for what you said
Does it make you feel good to make me feel less than I am?
Does it make you feel strong? Like you're a bigger man?

What did I do to deserve you to shut me out?
Did I love too much? Is that what this is about?
I used to thank god every morning for having you in my life
And now I'm praying just to forget you, and you know why

'Cause I'm dying here
You were lying it was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light
And I'm dying here,
And I'm crying over you that I remember
But now you make me shiver
You're so...
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old

And if you were gonna lie, at least be a man and lie it to my face.
So you can watch my tears turn to blood, as I tear myself apart
Wondering why, why I ever fell for you
I put myself through hell for you

Fuck you, I hate you!
I love you, I need you
Wanna run, wanna run
I wanna run, but I don't wanna run if you're not gonna find me.
So we should just pretend to be friends, right?
And fake our way to the bitter end.

'Cause I'm dying here
You were lying it was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light
And I'm dying here,
And I'm crying over you that I remember
But now you make me shiver
You're so...
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old

But now you make me shiver in the light
And I'm dying here,
And I'm crying over you that I remember
But now you make me shiver
You're so...
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old
Co-o-o-old

But now you make me shiver
You're so...

(You said that I'm the one)
(So why'd you leave me shivering in the cold?)
