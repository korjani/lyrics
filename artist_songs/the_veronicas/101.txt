You are the one that changed me
You are the one that keeps me open
Right from the start oh baby
I couldn’t keep my heart from floating
up up up to far away to see
How your love is got the best of me
Can’t get enough and I don’t want to 
I wanna hear you...

Say that I’m the one that you can’t get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take a time
We know love is hard to find
Say you’re coming back for me 
That you made a mistake and I’m the only one
She doesn’t turn you on

I keep the last night frozen
If I could only adjust your memory 
I could make you love me if you could give her up
Just give her up and take me
Down down down to far below to see
How your love has got the best of me
Can’t get enough and I don’t want to I wanna hear you...

Say that I’m the one that you can’t get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take are time
We know love is hard to find
Say you’re coming back for me 
That you made a mistake and I’m the only one
She doesn’t turn you on...

I’ll wait around if I have to stay here until she’s gone
Gone!
You can always have me you can’t let me go...

Say that I’m the one that you can’t get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take are time
We know love is hard to find
Say you’re coming back for me 
That you made a mistake and I’m the only one...

No she doesn’t turn you...
