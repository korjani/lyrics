We were chasing the moment
We were feeling our power
We were hungry and broken
Throwing up in cold showers

And I loved every minute of it
Yeah every blurry moment of it
I thought we'd before we reach the sky
Yeah I loved every minute of it
When we're still in the middle of it
How did we ever get this far and still survive

Back when we were young and drunk
Love could never last forever
Then we sobered up
Swear my heartbeats all you better
You, you're the only high I need
You, you're the only high I need

Waking up on the hardwood
It's your taste I remember
It was right cause it felt good
Could've laid there forever

Back when we were young and drunk
Love could never last forever
Then we sobered up
Swear my heartbeats all you better
You, you're the only high I need
You, you're the only high I need

Only high only high
Only high only high
Life was so loud that we couldn't turn down
We were too proud til we figured it out
Only high only high
Only high only high

Back when we were young and drunk
Love could never last forever
Then we sobered up
Swear my heartbeats all you better
You, you're the only high I need
You, you're the only high I need
