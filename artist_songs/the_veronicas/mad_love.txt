It's kinda cool in your company,
It's kinda hot when you're mad at me,
You know I hate it when I lose a fight,
But you'll make it up to me tonight,
I take you places you've never been,
You make me shiver when you touch my skin,
And then there's days that you don't come around,
I'm running trying to chase you down

We got that L O V E, the kind that makes you mad,
I put up with your crazy 'cause I'm your better half,
I think I like the challenge because I love to win,
You know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the the day I met ya,
One look in your eyes and I could not forget ya,
You got me feeling oooh, you got me feeling, oooh
Mad love, mad love

Trouble from the the day I met ya,
Got me seeing double, how could I forget ya?
You got me feeling, ooh, you got me feeling oooh
Mad love, mad love

I can take it baby that's alright,
You can't love without a little fight,
I really wanna be with you man,
You're such a pain to try and understand,
But the way you lay it down on me,
I get weak and it's hard to speak,
I gotta feeling you cast a spell,
I slipped and then I fell

We got that L O V E, the kind that makes you mad,
I put up with your crazy 'cause I'm your better half,
I think I like the challenge because I love to win,
You know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the the day I met ya,
One look in your eyes and I could not forget ya,
You got me feeling oooh, you got me feeling, oooh
Mad love, mad love

Trouble from the the day I met ya,
Got me seeing double, how could I forget ya?
You got me feeling, ooh, you got me feeling oooh
Mad love, mad love

We got that L O V E, the kind that'll make you mad,
I put up with your crazy 'cause I'm your better half,
I think I like the challenge because I love to win,
You know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the the day I met ya,
One look in your eyes and I could not forget ya,
You got me feeling oooh, you got me feeling, oooh
Mad love, mad love

Trouble from the the day I met ya,
Got me seeing double, how could I forget ya?
