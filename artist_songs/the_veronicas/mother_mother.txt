Mother mother
Can you hear me
I'm just calling to say hello 
How's the weather
How's my father
Am I lonely heavens no 
Mother mother
Are you listening
Just a phone call to ease your mind 
Life is perfect
Never better
Distance making the heart grow blind 

When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt 
Would I try a little tobacco
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt 

I'm hungry 
I'm dirty 
I'm losing my mind 
Everything's fine 

I'm freezing 
I'm starving 
I'm bleeding to death 
Everything's fine 

Yeah, I'm working
Making money
I'm just starting to build a name 
I can feel it
Around the corner
I could make it any day

Mother mother
Can you hear me
Yeah I'm sober sure I'm sane 
Life is perfect
Never better
Still your daughter still the same 

If I tell you what you want to hear
Will it help you to sleep well at night 
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear
Now just cuddle up and sleep tight 

I'm hungry 
I'm dirty 
I'm losing my mind 
Everything's fine 

I'm freezing 
I'm starving 
I'm bleeding to death 
Everything's fine 

I miss you 
I love you
