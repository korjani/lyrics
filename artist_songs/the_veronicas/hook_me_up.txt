I'm tired of my life
I feel so in between
I'm sick of all my friends
Girls can be so mean
I feel like throwing out
Everything I wear
Starting over new
Cause I'm not even there

Sometimes...
I want to get away some place 
But I don't want to stay too long
Sometimes
I want a brand new day
Trying to fit in where I don't belong
Hook....Hook me up
I want to feel the rain in my hair
Hook....Hook me up
Where should we go?
I don't even care
Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up
Hook me up

I like the lights turned out
The sound of closing doors
Not like other girls who always feel so sure
Of everything they are
Of what they're going to be
Sometimes I'm just a girl stuck inside of me
of me

Sometimes
I want to disappear some place 
But I don't want to stay too long
Sometimes
I'm feeling so alone
Trying to fit in where I don't belong
Hook....Hook me up
I want to feel the rain in my hair
Hook....Hook me up
Where should we go?
I don't even care
Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up
Hook me up

Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up

They're going to crash and burn
I'm going to find a way
Nothing left to say

Hook....Hook me up
I want to feel the rain in my hair
Hook....Hook me up
Where should we go?
I don't even care (I don't even care)
Hook....Hook me up
I want to feel the rain in my hair
Hook....Hook me up
Where should we go?
I don't even care
Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up
Hook me up
Hook me up
