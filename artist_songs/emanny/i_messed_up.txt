This wasn't what it's supposed to be
I went from having fun to having fantasies
And I had every chance to get you away from me
But now I am just coming back like a feen
You went from a slide to a friend
Then a lover now you're everything
Tryna lie and tell myself that you ain't anything
But I'm in your bed with my phone off
Should be out the door but I doze off
When I know I should be leaving
But I can't control how I am feeling

[Hook:]
I messed up I started to care
Wish I could leave her right after we finished
But I stay in it
I messed up I feel in love with her
Not what I wanted or needed
But found it now tryna lose it
I messed up I messed up I messed up yeah

[Emanny:]
Never did it occur to me
That one night of passion could ever
Lead to you being the one for me
Can't believe I let you get close to me
I am out of my mind to ever think that I could
Keep this up without getting caught up with the reality
Try and lie and tell myself you don't mean anything
But I'm in your bed with my clothes off
Should put a condom on but we go raw
And I know I might be tripping
But I can't ignore how you're feeling

[Hook:]
I messed up I started to care
Wish I could leave her right after we finished
But I stay in it
I messed up I fell in love with her
Not what I wanted or needed
But found it now tryna lose it
I messed up I messed up I messed up yeah

I mean... we all do. Check this...
I mean we started out respectable
Was just a good time but it opened mind when she was bisexual
And now I am confused as I stare at the ceiling
While laying in bed with you no senses like a vegetable
You the type of chick that I tell my niggas I'd never do
Was supposed to be the pop off
Top me off every time she got dropped off
Somewhere in there all morals got lost
Looking like assault without a weapon
Shorty with her guard down and me without protection
Was thought that you can't tame a ho
But if you should try and get denied you shouldn't blame a ho
That's the only game she know but I keep a poker face
Cause With all the shit that I hear about her
It be ashamed if niggas knew that really I cared about her
Started out respectable
Was just a good time but opened my mind
When she was that flexible
And changed the whole set of rules
Now instead of calling shorty a cab I let her stay
And honestly she might be the best mistake I've ever make

I messed up I messed up baby
I messed up
