The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

[Chorus:]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh, I try to speak, but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I feel so helpless, I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid?
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

[Chorus]

And when you smile that smile the whole world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
Whenever you come around
