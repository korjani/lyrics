Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raising children
It's a job meant for two

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone

Today was Angie's birthday
I guess it slipped your mind
I tried twice to call you
But no answer either time

But the postman brought the package
I mailed some days ago
I just signed it love from mama
So Angie wouldn't know

Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raising children
It's a job meant for two

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone

Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raising children
It's a job meant for two

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone
