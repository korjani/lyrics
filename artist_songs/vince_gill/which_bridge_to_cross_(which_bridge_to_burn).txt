I've got two lovers in my life now
A true love and one that's brand new
I'm not really sure that I know how
To love one and tell one we're through

[Chorus:]
I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned
I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern
Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn

I knew this was wrong, I didn't listen
Cause a heart only knows what feels right
Oh I need to reach a decision
And get on with the rest of my life

[Chorus]
