Said the nightman to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see

A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear

A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepard boy the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know

A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver a gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say

A child, a child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
