Everything I ever learned
Every bridge I ever burned
Got me to where I am today
I've got no regrets
You can't win if you don't bet
It's just a game that we all play

And it's so hard to lose
When you have to choose
So go your separate ways
On that lonely road
Is such a heavy load
Just one more mistake I made

I did the best I could
And things I thought I never would
A whole lot more good than bad
It's you I miss the most
You still haunt me like a ghost
Your love is more than I've ever had

And it's so hard to lose
When you have to choose
To go your separate ways
On that lonely road
It's such a heavy load
Just one more mistake I made

Moments that stay with you
Will break your heart in two
Remember the ones your heart forgave
Everything I've ever learned
From the pages I have turned
Just one more mistake I made
Just one more mistake I made
