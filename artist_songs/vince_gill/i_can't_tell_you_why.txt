Look at us baby
Up all night
Tearin' our love apart
Aren't we the same two people
Who lived through years in the dark

Every time I try to walk away
Somethin' makes me turn and stay

I can't tell you why

When we get crazy
It just ain't right
(Try to keep your head on, girl)
'Cause girl I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you

Nothin's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be

I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
Somethin' makes me turn around and stay

I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why... yeah

No, baby
Ooooh, I can't tell you why
