We've been friends for a long, long time
You had your lover and I had mine
One night I looked at you and I think we both knew
Some night I'd hold you in my arms

[Chorus:]
Maybe tonight we'll find each other
Maybe tonight you'll turn around and I'll be there
If the timing is right we could finally get together
We might just fall in love and it may be tonight

Two hearts of fire can't live like this
A burning desire we can't resist
Who's gonna break the ice
Who's gonna roll the dice
And it would take is just one kiss

[Chorus]
