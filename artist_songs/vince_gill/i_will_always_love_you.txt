If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bitter sweet memories
That is all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't you cry
'Cause we both know I'm not what you need

But I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life (I hope life)
Treats you kind (treats you kind)
And I hope you have all you dream of
I wish you joy (wish you joy)
And happiness (and happiness)
But above all this I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
Yes, I will always love you
I will always love you
