Pulling tricks about my bag
X-nay on the Jag
Pulling back them tags
Everything new, feeling never gets old
Yellow go whites
Everything, everything slipping from my fingers
Always a gentleman, always distinguished
Everything, everything new, think like a heathen
Speak like a gingis sultry O'Neil
Everything, everything new

Coupon steel like a braces
Funny how you think this
Came over night tho,
Just came through the right door
Now they're tryin' to push me left
I'm trying to get it right more

Some days I think I'm loony, or some kind of psycho
Haters got me vexing
Loading up this rifle
I'm thinking that I might go
Dump getting drunk and in hate mode
Cruising through the flat slow

And I could take it over but I'm thinking bout a lot more
Everything is not fault
Me I be honest, but I'm a try to get it all
Gee, I'll be on it
I can feel the money coming, pause it
This is just the calm before the storm gets
Crazy dollar bills fall, let me get my charmslet
Ask them why they coming
Young nigga owes heads man cause they lost it
I didn't like your post-it
Then blow your Ts never crossed it

She want everything too
Comes about that zoo
Making fur lynx, gator on that shoe
She got haters on her too
They be coming out the blue
What the hell you gonna do
When everything new
Just keep quiet and let that money talk
Get the hell up in this two seater
Sweep through this city like a group
This city, mind it till I lay up in that tomb
Then I pass it on the
