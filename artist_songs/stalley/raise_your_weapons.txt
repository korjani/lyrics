[Verse 1: Stalley]
They sayin' I'm the last of a dyin' breed
And this generation is in a dire need of a voice like me
Someone to embody the glory, I guess that's me
Someone to tell the story of the people like me
Those who came from nothin' and fought like me
They said that I'd be nothin', I'd be dead by 23
The pastor said becase I'm Muslim I'll burn eternally
And my sheik said because of my tattoos, Heaven I'll never see
So I'm out in the open, all alone, searchin' for some peace
Mentally I feel enslaved by this weak economy
So I'm thinkin' 'bout buyin' a piece and robbin' everyone in front of me
But the funny thing is, we all feel it
I'm just speakin' of pain that we all live with
But we God's children, civilians of the ghetto
But cry so loud, I'd be damned if they throw this echo
They tellin' me to let go, ask me why am I upset for?
Yeah, I'm upset, yo
Cause you won't except the people that I rep for
The kids with broken hearts and torn souls that find it hard to let go
Confusin' them with your religions
And lyin' politicians, throwin' us in you prisons
Makin' us welfare recipients with no hope, so why hope?
You bastards listen before it's a nation of millions I provoke
And we show up at your front door
Weapons raised, no questions, man
You knowin' what we come for
Respect of the utmost

[Bridge]
Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon
Raise your weapon
One word and it's over
Raise your weapon
Raise your weapon
Raise your weapon
Raise your weapon

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Non, non, nonviolent what they tellin' me
But a killer is what closin' me, no mercy for they punk ass
They threw too many shots, not to bust back
I came too far to go back
All these words I done spat
The coallition [?] you been warned that it's combat
So black gloves, black mack, I'm strapped up like Cojack
Niggas better run like Bo Jack
I'm blitzin' with these raiders
All these haters better Code Red
You punks better run inside
Cause these dogs that ride noses're red
And they so fed up with all this corny fake shit
They want real, and they so trill
And they throw steal and they don't feel
Sympathy toward your judgement
You can call the law or call the gods
But they still not budgin', so we thugin' until they brung in
Standin' here 'til the sun dim and it's back up
Lexus, got 'em raised up
No power 'til we was raised tough
And we all together, so get raised up or get rolled on
Got crips, bloods, and them Stones on
This revolution is so strong, and this war we ain't start alone
