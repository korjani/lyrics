I didn't seen it all
I I didn't seen it all
Good men fall from where they at
Women tryna run and crawl back
I didn't seen it all
I didn't seen it all
Ball once before
Then lost it all
Heart turned cold
My ego grew small
But all these things I saw
Helped me become
Everything I are
I mean I've been through it all
I I've been through it all

This ish small to a giant
I'm trying hard not to be a tyrant
But they trying to oppress me and I'm dyeing
And inside I got this lion
Roar and try to come out
See I got these king traits and I just them to come out
And who I really is
Don't wanna be entrapped up in this show biz
Cause most kids get caught up
Feeling like they all tough
Alter their life style
Feeling like what's right now is gonna last forever
I mean you only as hot as the weather
And it gets cold in November
So when the seasons change, people change
And when their love's gone, it's gone
Feel like the reaper came
So so long, so long
Goodbye to everything that keeps you sane
Strange, strange mind got me caged age
A caged mind got me full of rage
I got about fifty in this twelve gage
And I ain't afraid to let them shells spray
If it's all clip on this damn gray
I'm in my chambray and socksters hand made
And I pray God never let's me go down that way
So my therapy for everything is sinking through this page

I didn't seen it all
I I didn't seen it all
Good men fall from where they at
Women tryna run and crawl back
I didn't seen it all
I didn't seen it all
Ball once before
Then lost it all
Heart turned cold
My ego grew small
But all these things I saw
Helped me become
Everything I are
I mean I've been through it all
I I've been through it all

So think twice before you pray for this
Cause that famous superstar and she's dangerous
I mean it looked good from the outside
But they will try to kill you from the inside
No sides, I'm taking on whoever
Being a good man, it just don't last forever
Cause once you're crazy you're just crazy and that half is better
When dealing with these marks you gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep your bread up, it's a different kind of setup
When you're in that spot light friends become enemies
Enemies become friends and it's all for the pot life
The deeper I get into it, I relate the parts life
I'm top down, riding around to this vaguest night
No sug, just a chug og Coke and a Sprite
Tryna liberate my life
It's like I'm making money for the hype
Smoking, tryna take flight
Back to back, grapes it's getting harder and harder to feel my face
Pants hanging from my waist
I'm let my nuts hang, speakers all the way up
Let my trunk bend, just drowning out the sound of pain
Getting comfortable and my rain is crying for like a thousand chains weighing me down
But looking back on the miles I came
I'm a wear this thing like the proudest king now
Seen a lot in the last few years
It's all been astonishing
They sayin' my future's promisin'
And I'll soon have it all
I told 'em this ain't nothing new
Boy I didn't seen it all

I didn't seen it all
I I didn't seen it all
Good men fall from where they at
Women tryna run and crawl back
I didn't seen it all
I didn't seen it all
Ball once before
Then lost it all
Heart turned cold
My ego grew small
But all these things I saw
Helped me become
Everything I are
I mean I've been through it all
I I've been through it all
