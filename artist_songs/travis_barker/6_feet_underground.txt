[Hook: Tim Armstrong]
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
If you try, going to lie
6 feet underground

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Papa's in the closet, loading up that buckshot
Little sister hide behind the grandfather clock
I've seen that old blood money get washed
I watched the shotgun shell go pop
Got a couple rounds in the Chevy ashtray
I don't know why I was made this way
Sec-ur-ity don't want to get me
If we can't get in, the fuck you say?
Too much billy is in this cup
Too many people are in this club
You keep looking at me like you want to jump
If we let loose homie, you won't get up

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Little brother plays in the front yard gym
He only thinks, Jim's too quick
He stands 5 foot 2, nickname Slim
Motherfucker thinks he's 6 foot 10
Never seen a young man act so tough
Never see a frown [?] drown
Put another pit back in his cup
You know it's a fucking party when they coaster down
I know a little something about getting high
I know a little something about getting drunk
You fuck with the Wolfpack and everybody cries
So go jump in the pen and [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I don't really know what's wrong with me lately
I don't really feel like myself
Everybody's reaching for money
Sorry I can't help
[?] like I throw you a bone
But if you were my dog, I wouldn't throw you a bone
I'd throw you a log
With, both of my knees
Both of my knees, on the ground
(I'm dropping famous shit)
People that are close to me know that god damn
Drew? famous quick
Row with the boat, [?]
With the bottle, my heinous kid
Jump, when I say, jump
You've got to jump [?] clear
[?]
Stand up with team
Stand up on the ball!
Like a fucking animal
Eat, if I got to eat
I'm a eat you alive!
I said eat, if I got to eat
I’m a eat you alive
Yeah I know I said it twice
And don't make me say it again motherfucker!

[Hook]
