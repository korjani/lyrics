Maybe when I get a little bit older
I'll get caught
Telling a lie, telling a lie
Why can't I get a little bit older?
I hear it happens, all the time

Looking from the outside and I can't get in
Is it cos' I'm tired? Baby I'm so tired
Feeling all your whispers soaking in my skin
Will it make me faithful? why can't I be faithful?

I wanna know what love is, I wanna know what love is
I wanna know what love is, I really hope that it's not you
[x2]

If the room gets a little bit colder
Should we take it as a sign? is it a sign?
When my tear trickles down your shoulder
You get yours, you got yours

Baby it'd be different if I was satisfied
Would it make you better? Want it to be better
I got a sick illusion stuck in my mind
I thought it would be softer, I wish it was softer

I wanna know what love is, I wanna know what love is
I wanna know what love is, I really hope that it's not you
