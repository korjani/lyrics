You know that I don't talk about you, anymore
I've been trying to stay in line
But you are my good time
And I've been thinking what you're thinking
Yeah, I've been thinking what you're thinking
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you

I feel that feeling
I feel I'm coming down
But for some reason
I come around, come around
I know that feeling
I know I'm coming down
But for some reason
I'm still around, still around

You know that I don't fuck with the truth
Fuck with the truth
Anymore

I've been dying to tell a lie
Well, just to stop from crying
Cause I'm thinking what I'm thinking
Do you know what I'm thinking?
When I'm not thinking 'bout you?

Running around, running, running, running around, running around

I feel that feeling
I feel I'm coming down
But for some reason
I come around, come around
I know that feeling
I know what's going down
But for some reason
I'm still around, still around
