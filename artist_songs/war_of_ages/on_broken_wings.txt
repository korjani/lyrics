Why am I afraid of the fall?
Begging to hide every lie drifting further from home.
Now forced to feed from the bottom, I would die to be in your arms
Break free from your idols, break free from your fear
Put to death every concept that we were forced to believe

So shall I be saved from my enemies
The sorrows of death surround me
I cry out for you

Show your true self, laying the path to your grave
I laid the foundation now it’s time to breathe on your own
Forever is the cry of your heart now revealed
Forever every tongue will confess you are God

We are the fallen
