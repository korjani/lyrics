Can I withstand the pain that dwells within?
I won't let go for my wounds are far too deep.
I'm on my knees in submission to the pain I've caused.
Will I give in or can I find the will to breathe again.
I never thought I'd be on my own.
Now bring me peace that shelters me.
You shed you blood just so I could live again.
For a time I walked in darkness yet you were there to lead me through.
Hear me.
Take my hand.
Lead me from this place.
Guide my heart.
I am yours.
I give myself to you.
Bring us hope.
Give us strength.
Now set us free.
