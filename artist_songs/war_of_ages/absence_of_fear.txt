Once again I'm lead through my own nightmare.
Inside me the pain I bear wounds my soul.
My emptiness healed my wounds and left me helpless.
I never thought that I'd feel so alone.
Is there hope for me? For I am broken.
I refuse to believe this is the end for me.
Here I am suffering.
Bring me hope.
I'll sacrifice all I am.
For one last breath.
Just to taste what it's like to be free and cast aside all the wounds that hinder me.
Now rise up, cast down your fears.
Your time has come.
