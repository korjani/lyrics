Searching for desire earthed beneath distraction.
Lord please grant us with your mercy as our quest unfolds.
Against all opposition a true sense of self.
We only hope to discover the very reason we are here.

(Awaken me)
Like a passing wind I change the way I've lived
(From this we pray)
Lord please grant me with desire and let it fill my empty soul.

We run from our calling only to get by.
As rain falls from the heavens excuses fall from our mouths.
As floodwaters rise this life is not my fault.
If only we would listen to the pulling on our hearts.

That failed, I won't give up. Here's our chance to prove ourselves.

(Awaken me)
Like a passing wind I change the way I've lived
(From this we pray)
Lord please grant me with desire and let it fill my empty soul.
(Awaken me)
There's so much I regret and still your mercy flows
(From this we pray)
Standing in your presence I feel I've been reborn.

Oh God heal our suffering.
Mend our open wounds.
Let your mercy fall.
