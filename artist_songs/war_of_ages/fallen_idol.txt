We are the children of promise
Set us free from the face of this world
We lift our voices and press on
Eyes set as we rise

Bow﻿ down to the face over me
Who is your god?
I'm going to live free
Taking flight right into my fantasy
On this ground looking down
It seems so clear
Close your eyes, hold them tight
Hold the people last

[Chorus:]
I see the face of the ariving god
And will at last be a suffering
I see the fault in the way I live
Through you I'm free
You came as the freedom that we had
Through the price﻿ of life
Salvation bought by the blood of your hands
I am free, I'm living free

Generation to generation all you love shall lie in waste through a path you thought you rose above
If you close your mouth and listen to what I was telling you
Your faith will die and the rest of your friends will follow you

[Chorus]

We are the children of promise
Set us free from the face of this world
We lift our voices and press on
Eyes set as we rise to our feet

We are the children of promise
We are the children of promise
We are the children of promise
Eyes set as we rise
