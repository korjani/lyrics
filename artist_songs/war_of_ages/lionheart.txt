You feel the weight and then you burst through the strongholds
Tearing through flesh with the heart of a lion
We were built for war masked in pain as we scream out your name
With the heart of a lion we crave, we crave
I scream out your name, hear me

Shed the weight from your past
Here is your chance to set this world on fire
Digging deep in the depths of your hell
Realize you were meant for so much more

We are the revolution of a broken dream
The remnants of a wounded past
This belongs to us so don’t claim it for yourself

Are you afraid of us now?
Don’t write us off when we fall
We are found in the battlefield holding our own
Son bring us home

Where are your sons, where are your daughters?
Make a stand until the sky rains fire
We are we are the chosen
