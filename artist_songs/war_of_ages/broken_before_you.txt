Give me the strength to stand apart from all my fears
And stay true to all that I hold deep inside my heart
Hide me underneath your wings
You are the shelter we all need
With every breath I take You are there stand aside free me
You have bled for me now I bleed for You
With all my emptiness that I held I will never be the same
Put me to rest and renew my soul
We clench our fists and bare our arms
Only to cry out in Your presence
oh God to all who try to end my life
I stand firm and now I've been set free saved by Him
Whom I call king
Through Him I will always remain the same
I will always remain the same
You can't break me
