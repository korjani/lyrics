Lord I feel I'm struggling through this battle
Long for one peaceful day that I can call my own
Anger cast out and left for dead
These lies echo with no remorse
Shadows are a content plague
A Reminder of every failure
I will lay down my soul at your feet
God I feel your calling healer, you are my healer
Worthless and filled with anger
Here's a chance to prove my worth
Surrounded, I'm surrounded
By sorrow choking the life I praise
Anger is setting in
I've lad claim and called you out
Fear starts to battle you with honor pumping through your veins
