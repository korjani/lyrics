Light has dawned.
I've emerged to hide my face in disgust.
Reach for me in that day.
Ease the storm that's plagued me.
Although we live in darkness, will a torch ever burn and give us light as we close our eyes.
We've decided to walk alone, flirting with our arrogance.
The clouds roll in as our heads hang.
Lord, fill our mouths and our lives with your words.
I will life my voice and stand so we may live.
And fight the pride that holds me in place.
For I am not a slave to my fear.
Hide no more and leave your anchors at bay.
Surfaced the grave that's buried too deep.
Remove the dagger held by my lungs.
Hide no more.
Become a messenger.
Cry out a song of praise that is true.
Transform.
Become a flesh that's reborn.
Take the pride that darkens me.
Hear me.
For I won't be help down by fear.
No one will ever quench my thirst.
For I long for a better life.
I'll fight.
