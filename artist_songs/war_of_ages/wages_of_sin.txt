We've reached our destination yet we've failed you.
Dragged through our consequences in our wake we fall.

Rise to the satisfaction.
Hold to the pain we bear.
With our demise we: Rise in all our glory.
Rise to avenge our past.
Rise as hearts ret glare.
Rise with every heart beat.
Rise!

Why have we used our pain as an excuse to fight so boldly.
Here I am use me in every moment I have left.
We fall.

For those of you who hide in the shadows of our forefathers
"We are hard pressed on every side but not crushed;
Perplexed but not in despair;
Persecuted but not abandoned;
Struck down but not destroyed!"

Push through this final hour, truth lies within destiny.
We bow in your presence, bring forth the fallen world.
Stand for what's been promised, we've reached our destination.
Throughout life we waver and falter and now we wage war.

Hold me in your arms, how patiently we wait for our own death.
We wait for you oh Lord to come and fill the emptiness inside me.

Why have we used our pain as an excuse to fight so boldly.
Here I am use me in every moment I have left.
