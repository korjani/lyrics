I gave my life for you just to feel your touch again.
Here's my heart one last time.
Hold me close within your arms.
I've tried to hide my pain and yet your eyes see straight through me.
Will this night ever end?
Why can't I let go?
The time has come for the broken hearted to stand as one.
Our time has come.
I find hope when I look into your eyes.
A sense of warmth that I've never felt before.
Is it enough to mend a broken heart?
I can't believe I've let it go so far.
We try to find words to fill our voids.
When will we learn that our lies kill?
Everything we know will die and turn to dust.
Step out of the cold.
Say your last prayer.
You've built your walls now watch them burn.
Rise from the ashes we will stand strong.
This is our anthem.
Let it be known that we will fight for our life.
I have strayed far away from you and tried so hard to understand the reasons why.
My heart bleeds for you to enter me and heal all the pain inside that I felt over the years.
Here's my heart.
We see the strength of men and now our minds have shaped through time.
Will this night ever end?
Why can't I let go?
The time has come for the broken hearted to stand as one.
Our time has come.
I can't believe that it's gone so far.
