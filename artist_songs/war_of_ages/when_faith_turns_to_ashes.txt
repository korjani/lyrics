Death to our deceiver.
Your shoulders bear your consequences.
Fear the life you stole.
Kill with no remorse.

We fall by the hands of man.

Hide your selfishness, your fallen dreams glare through the eyes of our beholder.
Innocent your innocence.

Am I only in this to feel comfort, without pain I'd never know what comfort was.

Feel the innocence, feel your innocence.

I've become a slave to your selfishness.
Failure my failure, to act is now my death.

Innocent my innocence.
