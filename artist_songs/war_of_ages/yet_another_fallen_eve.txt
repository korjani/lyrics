Ever revealing hope to our comfort fills the void within our hearts.
Father reveal our worth, save us, this is our last breath.

Unconditional love, could it be she's found it.
Oh it feels so real, don't hold your breath!
His hands move down her thigh, taking seconds with every pass.
Please, please, don't ever leave me, she feels the burning in every heartbeat.

Dance through another night of fear, I'm hopeless without you.
Hold her close beneath your wings and keep her safe, hold her forever.
I can't forgive myself for the wound that I left you.
Save us, I'm begging you this is our last breath.

Look into her eyes, tears fall and hit the floor.
Her sweat still on his chest, a night filled with much regret.
Blind to the reality of the lasting impression.
Oh God I need you now, Lord we surrender.

God you are my shelter.
Lord I want to burn with passion.
Father you are the prince of peace.
God you are my shelter.
