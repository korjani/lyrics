We rise, born in the flesh
I will not let this be my regret
From dust we rise and to dust we fall
Keep your eyes on the path, let it go!
We rise, born in the flesh
I will not let this be my regret
From dust we rise and to dust we fall
Keep your eyes on the path, let it go!

You look back on the path take from it what you need
Find it hard just to breathe, bow down on both knees
Realize the anger built was all for nothing
[?]

We find favor in all the wrong places
We're going faster, regret is sinking in.
Somehow if we wait it all out, I feel it would be worth it
We're further from the truth.

Let the words be few, and rip the flesh from my eyes.
(Here I am) Staying strong until you (Rise again)
Let it rain now let it (Fall from you)
By the Grace of God, bow to the will of a King and give your everything
(Here I am) Staying strong until you (Rise again)
Let it rain now let it (Fall from you)
By the Grace of God, bow to the will of a King and give your everything

Find the will to survive (screams the path I lead?)
Sit back, say your prayers
Now let your body yearn
What's worth being (quoted without you with me?)
Take the candles, take the light
Now watch it burn

We find favor in all the wrong places
We're going faster, regret is sinking in.
Somehow if we wait it all out, I feel it would be worth it
We're further from the truth.

(Here I am) Staying strong until you (Rise again)
Let it rain now let it (Fall from you)
By the Grace of God, bow to the will of a King and give your everything
(Here I am) Staying strong until you (Rise again)
Let it rain now let it (Fall from you)
