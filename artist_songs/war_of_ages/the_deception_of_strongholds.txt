I wait for you to breathe through me.
Oh how I long for your love.
My faith guides me in this darkness.
I battle for you on my own.

I hear my calling, endless, you are endless.
Bring me to my knees, battle, the battle has only begun.

The separation.
Determination.
The separation.
(Will never hold us back)
Determination.
(I'll fight my way through)

Hold me close in your arms Lord.
Shelter me under your wings.
I find myself stronger with you.
My battle for you rages on.
