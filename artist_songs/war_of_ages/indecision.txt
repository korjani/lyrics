Confused by indecision from a broken home
Left here to find out there's nothing left
I stand alone through scattered winds untainted
By human failure reminding us what we lost
How consistently we fall without taking a breath
Watching our life pass until the day we die
Hope we can follow
Faithful, we are faithful
Lord I honor you, Lord
Closer, you bring me closer
Hopeless, the never ending hopelessness
Our last words climb to a higher point of rage
This world has fallen into sorrow through selfishness
Now we won't amount to anything
The failing art of redemption
Had become a sign that wee are not alone
Will we prove to the world of your existence?
or cower in the face of regret
