The tide has met the sand 
Covering footprints left for me
Hope is gone yet you carry me
You're carrying me
God my flesh is weak oh it's battling me, it's battling me
I hold no regrets and yet you wait for me
You know my heart now
If these walls could talk would they reflect your name

God give me the strength I need
Light the path through the fear
Let it change your heart
I will not lose sight of you
I will not let this fall through

You were there for me through all the pain I felt
We lift you higher than ever
You are the same the great I am
We lift you higher than ever

Set my eyes to flames while the weight of the world is holding me back
I felt like I could do it myself
You knew I was wrong and yet you played it the same
Here we are at the foot of the cross asking god to bleed

God give me the strength I need
Light the path through the fear
Let it change your heart
I will not lose sight of you
I will not let this fall through

I am a slave to nothing nor am I of this world
As we rise to our feet we walk the narrow road

You were there for me through all the pain I felt
We lift you higher than ever
You are the same the great I am
We lift you higher than ever
