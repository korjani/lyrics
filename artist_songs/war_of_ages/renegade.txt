You expect every word to scream forgiveness
Like a puppet filled with noise to fit your system
I come from filth raised in hate
Shaking your head like I should live a different way

We stand in the shadows of fallen men
Begging others to listen
Dwelling in the midst of Godless youth
Screaming Father forgive us

Let the pain run its course
if it suits you claiming that it’s anything but heartless
Preying on trust, but here’s the thing
You will never control me

We are created from flesh and blood
We stand beside a King for the world to see
