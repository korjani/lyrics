Lord God release us now
The time has come to release our rage
The weak shall fall but the strong survive
God prepare our hearts for war
A fight to the end is our last breath
We will search for the truth
Now we see our emptiness
And why our hearts are filled with so much pain
Because we chose to lead a word that has lost all hope
But if we rise together as one we will take this world by storm
We'll take this world by storm
We'll save you from yourself
From losing hope only the strong survive
We'll conquer all we fear and never walk away
Only the strong survive
....war!!
