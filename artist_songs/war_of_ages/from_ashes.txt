I’ll stand by your side

Fight for the path
Unto the forgiveness
We honor the vow
Leading to imperfection

You know every ounce of my past
And you’re still here
Focused on what I am inside
Instead of what I was

I will stand by your side
I will stand by your side
Can you hear the beating of my heart?
Can you hear the beating of my heart?

You know all my darkest moments
And you chose to overlook every fault (every fault)
I knew from the first time that I saw you
You were sent by God (send by God)

To take this wounded soul
And make it whole again
Past the bounds of time
The shadows fall before you

I’ll stand by your side
Trough the pain we conquer
Unite as one forever

Can you hear the beating of my heart?
Can you hear the beating of my heart?

Can you hear the beating of my heart?
Can you hear the beating of my heart?
