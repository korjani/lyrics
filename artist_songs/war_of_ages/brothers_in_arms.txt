You gave your life to save me
In time of need we rise
The time for change is near
Bound and broken
Find strength within yourself
We rise against our fate
Pulled together united as one
Stay true until the end

We are not the same
But stand together in one voice
Our strength in numbers come alive
Look back stop us now
There till the end
Our banners we raise above with pride
You'll never get the best of us
In you we stand true

We find strength within ourselves
To win a battle against all odd
Until the day we rise together for the world to see
We raise our banners on high
When the time comes I will be ready and we will never be the same

They will never get the best of us
Through the strength in our hearts
You have my back
We will never be divided
