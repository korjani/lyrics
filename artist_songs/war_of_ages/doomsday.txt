We are fading from our soul
Without letting go
Let our faith renew all hope
Without letting go

The full effect of the front line
Waving a banner for the hell of it
Holding truth no matter who it hurts
Bold in chaos zero regrets
You’re the father of lies
Bouncing back to the free world
Fallen, you have fallen
Taking your faith as weakness

Bound through chaos we thrive
Our inconvenience has left you wanting
You burn

So calm and collected seeing the pain
In what you’ve created
Blinded by self worth from every soul
Feel the fire

Would you break from your freedom?
Given the choice before the fall
Start with our failures, set it off
Even now you’re relentless fueled by rage
When the fool meets the hard road
Give him strength, give him strength
