Baby help me, I feel empty.
It's like there's something wrong with me.
I can't shake the thought of drowning.
I swallowed water in my sleep.

I can't leave again,
Time is something we don't have.
Lay with me, my friend -
Let me breathe you in.
If I could,
I would stop the whole world,
To grow old with you,
And die in this moment.

Let me breathe you in.
Let me breathe you in.

I see your face in everything.
A fleeting memory of where I want to be.
I roll your hair between my fingertips,
But that won't make it real.

I was never scared of dying alone,
Until I knew what it was like to have a home.

I can't leave again,
Time is something we don't have.
Lay with me, my friend -
Let me breathe you in.
If I could,
I would stop the whole world,
To grow old with you,
And die in this moment.

I was never scared of dying alone,
Until I knew what it was like to have a home.
I was never scared of dying alone,

I would stop the whole world,
To grow old with you,
And die in this moment.

Let me breathe you in.
Let me breathe you in.
