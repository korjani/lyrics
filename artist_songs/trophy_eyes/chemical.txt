Break it down to an inside voice
The one that speaks the loudest always knows the least
We know the speed of light but not the speed of thought
Is it chemical or miracle each time we talk?

What is a minute but a man made name?
Given to the emptiness and infinite space
To comprehend the time between asleep and awake
And read it on our graves as a dash between the dates

We're so afraid of the limits we've made
If love is just a chemical reaction
Why is death so different?
