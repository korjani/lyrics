Lay your head on my shoulder,
As I draw pictures in your skin.
And I leave marks behind with my fingertips,
Like lines in wet sand.
One day the tide will come,
And wash away everything that I did.
And your memories of me will disappear,
Into bad dreams.

So stay away from me.
Now that you know what kind of man I can be.
Breaking hearts is second nature to me,
I'll step over you just to get what I need.

So damn smart and interesting.
Don't say that you weren't warned,
I will only break your heart.
So damn smart and interesting,
Don't say that you weren't warned.
I'm so dangerous.

So stay away from me,
Now that you know what kind of man I can be.
Breaking hearts is second nature to me,
And I'll step over you just to get what I need.
A broken heart will take some time.
But I'll be better overnight.
I see the tremble in your smile,
Don't cry for me - I can't feel it.

You should have listened to me.
You should have listened to me.
You should have listened to me.
You should have listened to me.

So stay away from me,
Now that you know what kind of man I can be.
Breaking hearts is second nature to me,
And I'll step over you just to get what I need.
A broken heart will take some time.
But I'll be better overnight.
I see the tremble in your smile,
Don't cry for me - I can't feel it.
Don't cry for me - I can't feel it.

So damn smart and interesting.
Don't say that you weren't warned,
I'm so dangerous.
