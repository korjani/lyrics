Rain, rain on me
Every raindrop that touches my skin
Makes a sound like your name
Makes a sound like your name

It made a hole inside of me
A hungry aching void
That clamoured to be filled
And only found easement in your voice

I'll keep the world awake
For taking me away
As long as there's breath left in me
None shall sleep

Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay

Rain, rain on me
Every raindrop that touches my skin
Makes a sound like your name
Makes a sound like your name

I can feel it deep inside of me
I can feel it burning in my skin
I'm too old - too firmly moulded
To say how you make me feel

I'll keep the world awake
For taking me away
As long as there's breath left in me
None shall sleep

Rain, rain on me
Every raindrop that touches my skin
Makes a sound like your name
Makes a sound like your name

Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake
Stay
