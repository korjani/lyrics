I want to die some inconspicuous way
To have everything mean nothing, would mean everything to me
To die in a way that would hurt my mother the least
To stay out of the papers and off the TV

I wouldn't bleed out in a bathtub 'cause blood fucking scares me
But I'd jump in front of a car like so many of my friends have
Like the time you took the needle even though it can kill you
And Tom couldn't sleep for weeks 'cause he had to watch you

What choice did I have when all the men in my family
Thought the only answer all would be swinging from trees
I know that it's selfish punching out early
But who's gonna miss me? Who's gonna miss me?

Who the fuck's gonna miss me?
Who the fuck's gonna miss me?
