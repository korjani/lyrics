Forgive me for I have sinned
The sin is within all the love I have found
I see her face and don't feel anything.
I've been falling child
but my head stays in the clouds
You see I'm leaving but I can't move
Only one I fear is you

By the start of the night
I had started a riot, but try as I might
It won't tear you apart
So I decided to die just to
Set us a light but to die is to know what it means to feel alive

Well she don't love me in this life of the next
(I can't lie I'll be forever second best)
Well I ain't alive I'm just here for the fun of it
(Would she rather be alone or dead?)

By the start of the night
I have started a riot, but try as I might
It won't tear you apart
So I decided to die just to
Set us a light
but to die is to know what it means to feel alive

Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul and bring my dreams to life
Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul bring my dreams to life

I'm sorry child I don't have the strength it takes to say goodbye
Even if it feels right

Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul and bring my dreams to life

Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul bring my dreams to life

What the fuck can I say to explain this disdain that I find inside her face?
It's like the very sense of staying stings just the same as the truth
She knows I'll be leaving soon
What words can I use to express the pain as I watch her tail lights fade away?
I'm never gonna board this fucking plane
I need you next to me

Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul and bring my dreams to life
Could you really lose me
Cos I could really use me now
Destroy my soul bring my dreams to life
