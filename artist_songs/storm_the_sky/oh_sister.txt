You were thrown into a mother's role.
There was no way you had a choice,
But your lessons were always clear.
I still remember your voice.
Guidance was taken to heart,
From birth you were there from the start
To show us what was right and what was wrong,
And because of you we've become so strong.
Because of you we've become so strong.
We've become so strong.

Oh sister of mine,
You've guided your brothers so far.
We've become men you've modeled,
Are you proud of us?
Are you proud of us?

I never thought you'd be the one that was lost (Oh sister, Oh sister)
You were always strong.
You were always strong.
You gave me everything, you showed me the way out, (Oh sister, Oh sister)
And now you'll hear these words screaming out from the crowd.

Without you I'd be so lost.
There was no way you had a choice,
Still your lessons they are so clear.
I feel lost when I can't hear your voice, (your voice)
Still your lessons they are so clear.

Living my dream thanks to you.
At the start I was doing this for you,
But I'm strong enough now to do this for myself.
Living my dream thanks to you.
At the start I was doing this for you,
But I'm strong enough now to do this for myself.

Oh sister of mine,
You've guided your brothers so far
We've become men you've modeled,
Are you proud of us?
Are you proud of us?

I never thought you'd be the one that was lost,(oh sister, oh sister)
You were always strong.
You were always strong.
You gave me everything, you showed me the way out, (Oh sister, Oh sister)
And now you'll hear these words screaming out from the crowd.

Oh sister of mine, (oh sister of mine)
You've guided your brothers so far
(From birth you were there from the start).
We've become men you've modeled,
Are you proud of us?
Are you proud of us?
Are you proud of us?

Oh sister of mine,
You've guided your brothers from the start.
