I drop my hands down by my side
She turns to face the door in spite
She walks like she's got purpose

If you were like an ocean I would be the shore
You're always reaching further, always wanting more

Falling out of bed like I could fly
I slowly make my way to her
Always make my way to her
Because drugs no longer work

If you were like an ocean I would be the shore
You're always reaching further, always wanting more

You found me alone
I kindly asked to go
and here we are again
All i want is you and all you want is him

All you see trends

If I go quietly
Because my heart
is as cold as the sheets are
Would you fall apart
or would you let me pass [x3]
