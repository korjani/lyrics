I swear I was incapable of life
I was paralysed (I was paralysed)
Stuck in stasis attached to the ground
I struggled to hear the sound
I never thought that I,
would ever get another chance to keep my hope instilled.
Another chance to feel.
I can't even fathom the fact that this is real. 

Don't make me admit it
(I found what makes me whole)
If I start to spill it all, I won't stop and I just don't know how far the pain of my past would go.
So keep quiet oh, just stay quiet yes I was a liar and now I'm alive and nothing feels the same
Nothing feels the same

I don't know the way but I'll Be there soon
I just know that it's not with you
I know I've got to get out now

I've been forgetting I'm alone
I've been residing anywhere that I can call a home
It gives me hope
It feels like you're all that I had to let go

Don't make me admit it
I found what makes me whole
If I start to spill it all I won't stop and I just don't know how far the pain from my past would go
So keep quiet oh, just stay quiet I yes was a liar and now I'm alive and nothing feels the same
No, nothing feels the same

Some day I'll paint a picture
From a perfect persons view
I'll paint perfectly between the lines, won't let the ink leak through
Then I'll shade away the stains of what I once believed was true
I'll paint on and on until I see a portrait portraying you.

I'll hang you on the wall to stay
So your eyes will always follow me
I'll be hiding all my thoughts away
So you'll never be just a memory

Don't make me admit it
You are what makes me whole
If I start to spill it all I won't stop and I just don't know how far the pain of my past would go
So keep quiet oh, just stay quiet yes I was a liar now I'm alive and nothing feels the same
No, nothing feels the same
