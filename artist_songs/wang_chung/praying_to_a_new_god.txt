What got into you got into me too
What came over you is coming over me
Feel like I've had enough of all the old stuff
I saw the writing on the wall on my T.V.
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah,
oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
They're saying the devil's got a new job
Start praying to a new--

A lot of Babel came down the cable
Everybody can be famous for a day
From shore to shore
A big department store
Is all that's left of the American way
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah,
oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying what are you afraid of
Start praying to a new--

There's a big world
In the street outside
In their uniform of pride
And they've all come
To see a star from the east
Is he man or beast?
Decide

Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied
The second coming is coming anyway

I hear them pray for more on every dance floor
I hear the word go out across the milky way
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah,
oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
Success and money's what he's made of
Start praying to a new--

Start praying, praying on the freeway
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the airwaves
Start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying at the back door
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the dance floor
Start praying to a new God
