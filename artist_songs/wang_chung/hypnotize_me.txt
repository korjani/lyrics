Darlin', I believe in love
Since I met you, baby
I believe in love
The way you hold me
My heart is stirred
You can control me
Without a word

[Chorus:]
Turn on you white light
In my open eyes
Oh girl, you hypnotize me
I feel your white light
You're so bright
I'm hypnotized
And as you're looking at me
It's a deep ecstasy
And no word is enough
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

Darlin', I believe in love
In this hate-ridden world
I believe in love
Do you know the power
You have over me
Use it every hour
Shine the light on me

[Chorus]

Turn me on (with your love)
Turn me on (with your love)
Turn your light around to mesmerise me
Turn me on, oo-oh
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

[Chorus]
