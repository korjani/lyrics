You’re the voice of reason that I can’t escape,
Cut me down a thousand times a day
I don’t need you anymore
I don’t need you anymore
I trusted you and there was no one else
All you did was make me doubt myself
Don’t believe you anymore
Don’t believe you anymore

You bled me out, you tore me down
Your time has come, you can go.

‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
All my faith has been wasted, wasted
‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
I don’t need you to save me anymore

I’m fragile, but I’m not a fool
I won’t hear another word from you.
You won’t hurt me anymore
You won’t hurt me anymore

The hand I held just held me down
It took so long, now I know

‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
All my faith has been wasted, wasted
‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
I won’t sit here and take this anymore

You can say anything that you wanna say
But my intention’s long gone and turned away
You’re such a lie, you were only the enemy
Everything you are I will deny

‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
I’ll just come out and say it, say it
‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
All my faith has been wasted, wasted
‘Cause you’re a lie (lie), lie (lie)
I don’t need you to save me anymore
I don’t need you to save me anymore
I don’t need you to save me anymore
