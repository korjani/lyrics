With the horses that you ride,
And the feelings left inside,
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind,
Well they claim they'd like to know,
And they'll fight you there to go,
And they're gatherin' around for all the show,

Well there is a reward,
To live and die by the sword,
Well they tried to complicate you,
But you left it all behind,
All the worldly possessions,
Are left for recollections,
And finally it's all gone!

They're releasing all the hounds,
What is lost can still be found,
When you're walking with your fear down on the ground,
Well there's those who choose to run
Following the setting sun,
And now it seems the journey's has begun,

Well there is a reward,
To live and die by the sword,
Well they tried to complicate you,
But you left it all behind,
All the worldly possessions,
Are left for recollections,
And finally it's all gone!

All the worldly possessions,
