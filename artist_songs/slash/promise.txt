The first time I ever saw you
You had that far away look in your eyes
And heaven's eyes shined down upon you
And the whole room filled up with light

Now the cruel world it's gonna try and change you
Try to hang you up and mess with your pride
Now the rich just try to chain you
You got to keep your fire burning inside

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

Now sometimes the world tries to slap you
And it seems to love watching you fall
I wont lie to you, it's gonna happen
You got to pick yourself up and move on

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

[SOLO]

Which star will I be thinking of tonight
Tonight
Which star will I be thinking of tonight
Tonight

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)
