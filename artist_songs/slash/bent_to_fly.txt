Mama, don't you cry
Don't you worry
I cannot stay here any longer

The time has come to find 
A distant calling
That only seems to get much stronger

And I know it's hard
To see the one you come to lean on make his way

Far beyond the womb
But I can't stay

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time

The sky is calling
The wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly

Remember yesterday
Before the storm
Before the innocence was lost

I promised I would stay
Forevermore
But every boy in time moves on

Your wounds will heal someday
This I know
But I am restless and so torn
Mama, I can't stay here anymore

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time

The sky is calling
The wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly

I can feel it coming
A perfect storm is rising
Gotta say my last goodbye

Mama, don't you cry
Don't you worry
I cannot stay here any longer

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time

The sky is calling
The wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly

Mama, I'm bent to fly

I can feel it coming
A perfect storm is rising
I gotta say my last goodbye
