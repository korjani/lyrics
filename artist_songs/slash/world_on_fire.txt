Well, they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose
You're the misfit, I'm the sinner
You're the heathen, I'm the fool
But, today, you'll be the master or the slave
It's up to you
Oh my beautiful disaster
Take me any way you choose

Don't fight it
Ignite it
This much I'm sure

I think it's time to set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time to push it to the edge (to the edge)
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again

It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues, come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions that will only waste my time
Let me tempt you with the evils of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer
Like a pusher, like a whore

Just try it
You'll like it
I'll give you more...

I think it's time to set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time to push it to the edge (to the edge)
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again

It's so dark, I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel something that's real before the end...

Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like what you see?
Kill the lights
Oh, come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby, just like fire to gasoline...

I think it's time to set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time to push it to the edge (to the edge)
I'm so fucking bored so trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again

Just trip the wire
(Just trip the wire)
This world's on fire
(This world's on fire)
Just trip the wire
(Just trip the wire)

It may never be this good again...
