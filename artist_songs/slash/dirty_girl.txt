I can't wait to see it
You just won't believe it
The things she does

There may never be two ways about it
Everything she do just turns me on
Anything I need she gonna find it
Put it where I know it don't belong

She gonna go all night yeah
She does like it when you take it real slow
Online my dirty girl

She make me feel alright yeah
She runs clean until the lights are down low say
Online my dirty girl

I can't wait to see it
You just don't believe it
The things she does

Anything you like she gonna show it
From behind a pixelated view
Drop another dime she will expose it
Do the things that no one else will do

She gonna go all night yeah
She does like it when you take it real slow
Online my dirty girl

She make me feel alright yeah
She runs clean until the lights are down low say
Online my dirty girl

Oh my dirty girl
She gets the best of me
But I keep coming back for more

She comes like electric lover
She got me reeling got me losing control

She comes like there ain't no other
Say ah ah ah don't want to let it go

She comes like a distant lover
She got me feeling what I never have known

She comes like there ain't no other
Say ah ah ah don't want to let it go

My dirty girl's online again

All night yeah
She does like it when you take it real slow
Online my dirty girl

She make me feel alright yeah
She runs clean until the lights are down low said
Online my dirty girl

Oh my dirty girl

I can't wait to see it
You just won't believe it
The things she does

Anything to get you off
(I can't wait to see it)
But she ain't free
(You just won't believe it )
So when you hold it
(The things she does)
You'd better not hold it too long
