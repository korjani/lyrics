Straight up
Tell me everything you've been through
Since I've been away showing off
You've got every little thing going on for you
So how come we can't connect
How quickly you forget
Straight up
Tell me everything you've been through

Let's meet in the middle, cause we both want a little bit more
If I waste what you're giving then I won't forgive it
You'll leave me just wanting it all
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle

Play tough
So now you're way too busy for me to be the one I love
What you made of
You've gotta show me if you want me to belong to you
Not just be a silhouette, someone that you'll forget
Play tough
So now you're way too busy for me

Let's meet in the middle, cause we both want a little bit more
If I waste what you're giving then I won't forgive it
You'll leave me just wanting it all
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle

Don't hide it, don't hide it
I can see you tryna hide it
I'm tired of this fighting, just take me there
Head in the clouds and it's driving me crazy
I'm tired of this fighting, just take me there
Don't hide it, don't hide it
I can see you tryna hide it
I'm tired of this fighting, just take me there
Head in the clouds and it's driving me crazy
I'm tired of this fighting, I'm tired

So let's meet in the middle, cause we both want a little bit more
If I waste what you're giving then I won't forgive it
You'll leave me just wanting it all
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle
Let's meet in the middle
Halfway in the middle
