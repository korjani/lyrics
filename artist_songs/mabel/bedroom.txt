You can only see me from the waist down
And I know that you can only want me when I lay down
You only ever need me when the light's out
Now I'm stuck in the dark
'Cause you've taken it too far

So I broke your guitar up against your television
And I smashed every glass that you had in your kitchen
Why don't we turn off our phones for the weekend?
Don't tell your friends that we haven't been sleeping
'Cause we're keeping it secret

You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom

Two days of the week, I was your main thing
'Cause soon enough, I found out that the other days were taken
So I don't believe a word that you've been saying
Telling me to come over, but you know that I wasn't sober when I

Broke your guitar up against your television
And I smashed every glass that you had in your kitchen
Why don't we turn off our phones for the weekend?
Don't tell your friends that we haven't been sleeping
'Cause we're keeping it secret

You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom

Tension in my body, a light reflecting off of me
Don't we look beautiful? It's a hell of a way to fall
So put your hands upon my body
The sheets around me softly
I know it's a broken home
But I don't wanna let it go

So I throw your guitar up against your television
And we break every glass that you have in your kitchen
Why don't we turn off our phones for the weekend?
Don't tell your friends that we haven't been sleeping
'Cause we're keeping it secret

You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom
You can only see me in the bedroom, bedroom
See me in the bedroom, bedroom
