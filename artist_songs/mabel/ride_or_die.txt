Turn off the lights
Revving it up
Dark purple sky
Throw out your phone
'Cause I know where I'm going
I'll be cruise-controlling

White lines, white lines
City on fire
I hear sirens
But fuck all of that
Speeding in the cold rain
Bullets bouncing off my body

I'll take a test drive with you
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
And I'll take a test drive with you
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night

Neutral downhill
Now put your hands up
It's part of the thrill
Can't you just trust that
I know where I'm going
I'll be cruise-controlling

Red light, red light
No turning back
I'm not the type to call it in
And I can feel the cold rain
Crashing through my body

I'll take a test drive with you
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
And I'll take a test drive with you
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night
All night, all night
(I'll ride and I'll die)

I need your touch
But don't call it love
You know I've got no time for that
You know I've got no time for that, Oh

But I'll take a test drive with you
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
And I'll take a test drive with you
(You're no good at love)
Make it a joy ride
And I'll ride and I'll die
