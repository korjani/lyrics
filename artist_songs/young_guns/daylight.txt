The shadows grow long
I know
You mourn the loss of light and head below
Close your eyes
Cross your heart
And hope
I know that you don't see it
But all we need is daylight

Daylight
All we need is daylight
Daylight
All we need is daylight
Daylight

You try to move on
I know
You’re caught between the darkness and the dawn
You're not alone
I know you don't believe it
But all we need is daylight

Daylight
All we need is daylight
Daylight
Here and now the storm clouds gather
Wrap around me and you
Yeah the world gets colder but I can see the truth

Daylight
All we need is daylight
Daylight
Here and now the storm clouds gather
Wrap around me and you
Yeah the world gets colder but I can see the truth
