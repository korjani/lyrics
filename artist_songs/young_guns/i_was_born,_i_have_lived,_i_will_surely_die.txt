I was born, I have lived, I will surely die
Facing defeat I'm still holding my head up high
Been deceived into thinking that it's alright
I just needed a reason to reach for the light
Now I've opened, opened, my eyes
Now I see it, the light and I need it

There's no doubt you can get yourself out if you want to
Don't turn away, don't be shy, you've got questions so do I
Every day is a chance to change the story
Don't run away, take a shot, give it everything you've got
Without pain, tell me what's the point in glory?

Yesterday just a boy now I stand a man
I'm out on the edge feathers clutched in my hand and I know, know
That a time will come when all is done
Nothing will remain and so it goes, goes

There's no doubt, you can get yourself out if you want to
When you're out on the edge, if the current calls you
The jump cos to fall is beneath you

Don't turn away, don't be shy
You've got questions so do I, every day is a chance to change the story
Don't run away, take a shot, give it everything you've got
Without pain, tell me what's the point in glory?

Don't turn away, don't be shy, you've got questions so do I
Everyday is a chance to change the story
Don't run away, take a shot, give it everything you've got
Without pain, tell me what's the point in glory?

Don't run away, don't be shy
You've got questions, so do I
Without pain, tell me what's the point in glory?
