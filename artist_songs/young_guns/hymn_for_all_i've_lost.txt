Can't keep my faith held in
Keep my mouth shut anymore
Oh it's impossible
Where do I fit in
When no matter where I stand I still fall?
I'm on the outside looking in
Looking in

Can't keep my mouth held shut
Keep my tired eyes open anymore
Stuck on the outside looking in

I sing the same old song
A hymn for all I've lost
