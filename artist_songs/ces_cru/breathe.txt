[Verse 1: Ubi]
The pillow is under my head, but I'm dying to get a breath
Lyin' up in a bed, cryin' to get her wet
My mind in a wreck
I said I'd get a little son and I didn't
And I don't know why I ain't did it yet
I hit her on the chat, wireless internet
She never hit me back, I try again on text
I don't even know why I'm buyin' into this mess
She usually reply in five minutes or less
Now the line gone dead, everyone of my guys all said
That I shoulda kept my mind on bread
Now my eyes' all red, puffed up
It's my fault, whenever I have a brush with love
I fall in, I was in it for a penny
A penny turned a pound
Now my Betty has turned heavy
So let me turn her down,
I never turn her down
She never heard about
What I did, now now
My breath's runnin' out

[Hook: Ubi (x2)]
Now I can't breathe, let it breathe boo
Maybe you and I are two different kind of people
I don't want to keep you, I can see you were never mine to keep
So I have to release you, and now I can't breathe

[Verse 2: Ubi]
She gon' make me wait, She gon' make me sit around
She gon' make me date, but I'm hungry for her
Emaciated, famished, her touch, and the way she tasted
Damn this, tryin' to be a man and handle it
Put in my right and channel it
The killer verse, at the end of the verse
There's still a burn, couldn't nothin' never replace her
When will I ever learn my concern
Boil it all down to one word, just her
When I think about it, it just hurts
What's worse, everybody's dyin' to fuck her
I stand in the line like I am a number
What is it two or three, A beauty I'mma beast
Like what did you do to me
You push and put it down
I'm pushin' for you and me
Now when I look around
I'm lookin' at you to breathe

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Ubi]
Now that we're getting so close
Why would you go this way?
You said you never would go
I'll never be the same
So now we're beggin' you no
Babe please don't go this way
Now that you're letting me go
I'll never breathe the same

[Verse 3: Ubi]
I started out with one, I'm left with none
Now I'm stressed out waitin' for my breathe to come
In the next town, center stage, layin' the Ces down
Tryin' not to feel the weight weighin' my chest down
Cuz everything became a mess
With the love gone and nothin' but pain is left
Reach my hand out but I touch the air
Clutch to hold on but there's nothing there
Peep the game out It's all just and fair
I beat my brain's out for the lust affair
And now I don't even fuckin' care
Cuz chillin' with this is too much to bare
Somebody numb me up, give me the gas
Shoots and pills, anything that'll make the pain stop
On the real, what I want now is to not to feel chills
Scott you that you got me still
I'm on lock until

[Hook x2]
(And now I can't breathe) [x2]
