I feel good about this one, B
Yeah, Ha

[Verse 1 - Ubiquitous:]
Praise goals, paid tows even if you play it pro
Player that's the way it goes, ain't nothin' to say no more
It's either that or feast, took a plate, only ate a roll
Felt regret, hunger that I kepper save me later though
Fire burn in my belly everywhere that I would turn
I was met with diversity and from that fire I emerge
Pen I felt along the way, never made it my concern
Took it as a lesson to the game and let the tires burn
Gassed out, gassed up, bout a pastor passed up
This to every faggot battle rapper that harassed us
Hard work, added up, perseverance paid off
Independent underground, grindin' no days off
Played a boss, paid a cost, rappin' then stayed lost
Now I need that prime cut, slathered in steak sauce
Matter fact I'm takin' all of that, then I'll take more
Livin' in the moment what you waitin' for, Good lord KC
Why you been actin' like some poor babies?
I get it crackin' never relax and doin' my chores daily
You got a fine wine well then my rhyme is the gourmet cheese
You're finally a guideline, I'm in my prime you been warned take heat
I got a list of accolades and I don't have to say
And I ain't talkin' now, I'm talkin' way back in the day
Headed up to now for real it's still nothin' to me
I'm finna top that, man I got that, y'all ain't fuckin' with me, boy

[Hook - Ubiquitous:]
Ayo what up though, what you lookin' at?
Took it from us and got pissed when we took it back
You pickin' up what I dropped and can't hold us
I'm plottin' on whatever you got now hand over
Give it to me, give it to me (Come on with it, all the way from the Midwest)
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me (It's the Ces)
Give it to me, give it to me (Give it up, from the front to the back)
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me (For the snake and the bat)

[Verse 2 - Godemis:]
Ain't nothin' changed, I still arrange to pack up in the civic
The frame of mind is ain't nobody fuckin' with the clinic
Ironically enough, you fuck with us and get the D- dick
Ya dig it? The faction back in action spinnin' Riddick
Oh is it, common knowledge I commit on the pivot
Killin' it, put on a show then we come in and steal it
Feelin' it, we bout to go bananas, can you peel it?
Cause U-B-I and Godi's like canvas and acrylic
But we don't know no limits, roll the credits, it's finished
Sit home and watch a chain, if they complain, I change the image
Heard opportunity knockin', hopped in the cockpit
Just another pissed pilot who's ready to drop ship
If death is certain, must mean the reaper is lurkin'
And his cousin sleep is creepin' in while we closin' the curtain
I'm working a fucking miracle out of the situation
To knock it back out of orbit and blitz the administration
So what do you want from ya dude? I gotta be ruder than Jude
The second I enter ya loo, I'm comin' to Rubiks ya cube
They lookin' at me like I'm food, been hurtin' to get em a meal
They wanna know steps that I took, been trynna get em a deal
Behold the murderous Hanzhong
I bring the death star to any planet ya land on
The prettiest in pink, I think you stuck in that Camron
With orange mocha frappe chinos and a man pawn, bitch

[Hook]
