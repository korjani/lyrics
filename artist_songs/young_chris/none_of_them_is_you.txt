Sparks flying up in the air, I ain't balled this hard in a minute
I spent a lot of money this year, gonna be a lot more when we finish
A lot of ice, a lot of jewels, champagne lot of booze
The girls are choose, that's cool but none of them is you

Train to bus, planes and trucks, living a life to the fame's up
Yeah, god damn live in a movie
Hover boys can't fit in my Louie
Oh we paper bottle with Louie
Same in every city,another model or groupie
They all wanna sit at the table get a drink
I don't know what they think they will never get to the bank
Now the flaw in my link, yeah
Perfect picture that they all wanna paint
Well they cant got a home bay
I can't let you be in my world, it's right after yo alls back to me and my girl
Never get what you got, care who it is never get in your spot
Stick to the plot, take a little ride and I switched to the top
She ain't tripping long as I don't forget what I got, hey love

Sparks flying up in the air, I ain't balled this hard in a minute
I spent a lot of money this year, gonna be a lot more when we finish
A lot of ice, a lot of jewels, champagne lot of booze
The girls are choose, that's cool but none of them is you

After all the shows and the hoes when there's nowhere to go
Cast money low, fast money slow,
I got her love, kisses and hugs meaning so much more than these bitches in the club
This is love, let's get married, hard to leave, Meth and Mary
All I need, Chris and Jordin hard to breath, no air just lost my breeze
We're in the air, parked the V's
Shorty locked me down and tossed the keys
Last man was winning he lost the lead
Fuck her she out of breath she call fatigue
Right back to living my life
Long as you don't take away from me give them my wife
Home away, after dark, come and get us in the light
And there's much more patience when you're living by the night, work with me

Sparks flying up in the air, I ain't balled this hard in a minute
I spent a lot of money this year, gonna be a lot more when we finish
A lot of ice, a lot of jewels, champagne lot of booze
The girls are choose, that's cool but none of them is you

Oh I need you, oh
Nothing like you, oh you should see them baby, they don't stand a chance
Because you know you're the one I come home to
To get back in love and baby can you
Can you even imagine me not there
No one else can even be compared
And whenever your gone, you know I'm waiting right here, oh
So would you turn the lights on

Sparks flying up in the air, I ain't balled this hard in a minute
I spent a lot of money this year, gonna be a lot more when we finish
A lot of ice, a lot of jewels, champagne lot of booze
The girls are choose, that's cool but none of them is you, look.
