[J. Cole:]
Uhh, what if somebody from the ville that was I'll
Got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talkin bout coke and birds, it was more like spoken wordcan't you see I'm putting it down,
Look this is the Roc bitch,
The new Roc bitch
They had it locked well I just copped a new lock bitch
Look how I hit em up I'm on some Tupac shit
We take it to a higher level two octaves
Cole, nigga I'm vicious with the flow
Don't take no cristal ball to predict that I would blow so quick
Get on your current events
Oh you ain't heard of that quit
No endurance, no insurance
You should be so embarrassed
Nigga you could have signed me
Now you little artist is garbage running behind me so
You wanna drop a man, your litter too much
Now get back to rap you niggas twitter too much
But I keep it hood I could finna Ku Klux
I ain't bitter with you pitiful fuck niggas
Couldn't tie my tennis shoes
Couldn't reach this high if you hit a few blunts
Sound like who, ahh bitches you nuts please
I run circles round these rap urkels
And if he act Hercules then he could smack purple
Relax this is the Roc and guess who stuntin for us
And yeah I run my own show nigga Martin Lawrence

[Young Chris:]
Young Boy outta Philly who was I'll got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
And way before he put together words
Them niggas was selling birds
Guess who puttin it down
This is the Roc trick that old Roc shit
I go tit locked I supply the whole block bitch
Gimme the loot listen to that old BIG shit
And we don't care about no vest's get your wig hit
See that boy vicious on the mic
Flow tighter than a girdle on bitches on a flight
Tight, pray for a bright day visions of a night
Good weed, little liquor pretty bitches get me right
Baby I'm a baller I was born on the March madness
What's the clarity it's a little bit flaw in your carrots
Silly rabbits little bastards nigga all of y'all average
I be the youngest Jackson with the glove I'm the baddest
Get the baddest whore's dime a dozen on tour
Box em out in the paint, d-cousins on boards
Hip hop deserve more for the strength of what we saw
Give an encore for Biggie smalls shakur
Big L and Pun, rest in peace to Pimp
The way they paved the way I could never be content
Give it up to underdog [? ] and the [? ]
And this ones dedicated to the ones appreciated
Good look...
