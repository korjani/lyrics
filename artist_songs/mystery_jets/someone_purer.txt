I was gripped with a bitter fear
Worried the one thing that I loved
Back when I was just a kid
Might now never be enough
That the body I was in
Might belong to someone else
Someone kinder, someone surer, someone innocent
Young and beautiful
Someone purer

That's no one I know

I was scratching at my skin
Hoping changes would begin
But what laid beneath was blood
Well of course
What the hell was I thinking of?
Won't you take me down to the creek?
Wash away our sins and sleep
I feel so tired
As though I might not wake at all on the other side

That's no way to go
That's no way to go
That's no way to go

Oh my dear one
Bathe me in your glow
Cut out my lonely heart
And bury it in the snow
Nothing really means nothing
Is the saddest thing I know
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll

And in the morning there'll be hope
And in the morning there'll be light
And if I sleep and dream up a system
A solution to fend off perils of the night
Come on in, I'll be born again
Born again as someone else
Someone kinder, someone surer, someone beautiful
Someone purer

And when I am you'll know
When I am you'll know
When I am you'll know
When I am you'll know

Oh almighty one
The devil knows my name
Will salvation come
To wash away my pain?
For I was once a kid
With a pure and innocent soul
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul

And a pure and innocent soul
Soul
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
