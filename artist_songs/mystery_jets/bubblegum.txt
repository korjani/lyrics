I'm always on the outside looking in
It's where I've always been
But the edge is where all the sparks fly
When the wheel spins
I swear someone is leaving message for me
Under my feet
In bubblegum on the sidewalks of my street
On the sidewalks of my street

Deep down I know I should leave the past behind
Maybe in time
If only I could learn to let go of the hand that first held mine

Took a walk down memory lane
Just to see what still remained
Only to find out just about everything had changed

We will splinter and we will divide
We will disappear to two different sides
And I hope that the world in which you find
Yourself is better than the one you leave behind

One day we'll return and we'll take a look around
See the me and you of every town
The dreamers who are yet to learn
That everyone will try to shoot them down

Spilling their guts down the radio wire
Like preaching to the Christmas choir
But they wouldn't piss on you
Even if you were on fire

We will splinter and we will divide
We will disappear to two different sides
But I hope that the world in which we find
Ourselves returning to is better than the one we left behind
Better than the one we left behind
Is better than the one we left behind
Better than the one we left behind
