I went to the desert
Because I wanted to find my pistol
I wanted to see what it would feel like to be invincible
But a man I met said, boy you ain't seen nothing yet
Let me take you for a ride

So I got in his truck and he took me to the mustang range
I paid my forty bucks to the girl at the window pane
Under the cover of darkness and behind my disguise
She said, kid won't you come inside?

She said
Don't you worry I won't tell anybody about it
You can do what you like until the morning light
I can be who you want me to be

Don't you worry ya sweet little head about it

I'll have you in bed, you know you'll have me back
You can have me there, but then you had me at hello

I want you to love me as if you got no principles
I want you to love me as if love is invincible
Under the cover of darkness and behind my disguise
I could tell she could see my eyes

You had me on the kitchen floor, you had me on the bed
You had me by the nick on the rug with the tiger head
You had me fast, you had me slow

You had me on the pillow where you lie at night and dream
You had me dressing up in your Alexander McQueens
You had me till they made me go
You had me at hello

She said
Don't you worry I won't tell anybody about it
You can do what you like until the morning light
I can be who you want me to be

I want you to love me, so don't feel sorry about it
I can hold you tight through the lonely night
I can be who you want me to be

Don't you worry ya sweet little head about it
I'll have you in bed, you know you'll have me back
You can have me then, but then I'll have you back
You can have me there, but then you had me at hello
