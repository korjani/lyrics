My lover loves
And providence
Are what [?]
In the telomere

The forest floor
And the patriarchal
The lone unsure
Of the telomere
Of the telomere
In your blood

The one thing they can't take away
The one thing they can't take away from me
Away from you
Okay

Where the cells reside
Splinter and divide
They will never die
In the telomere

In the telomore that lives inside us
And the people walking down below
Crawling home alone like spiders
As the cancer slowly starts to grow
In your blood

The one thing they can't take away
The one thing they can't take away from you
Away but don't be afraid

Is living in our blood
Is the one thing they can't take away
The one thing they'll never take away from you
Away, so don't be afraid

I'll tell it lives (in our blood)
I'll tell it lives (in our blood)
I'll tell it lives (in our blood)
