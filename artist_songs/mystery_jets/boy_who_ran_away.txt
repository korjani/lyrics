There was a boy a ran away
From what he didn't know
Whom, he wouldn't say
He just had to go

Something snapped inside of him
As he fled from a nameless threat
Crowds of people stood aloof in Waterloo
There's no sunset, sunset

And when he gets to this mythic place
The streets are dirty, dark and deep
There is no rest there
There is no place to lay a head to sleep, to sleep...

There was a boy who ran away
From what he didn't know
Whom, he wouldn't say
He just had to go

Went to so much trouble
To banish you from my sight
He said that you're an accident
An accident about which I should forget, forget...

And now that the wheel has gone around
He's back where he belongs
And he knows there is no hope
Only solace in the words of this song
Solace in the world of this song
Solace in the world of this song...

There was a boy who ran away
From what he didn't know
Whom, he wouldn't say
He just, he had to go
