Remember the time we shared our first cigarette?
Late at night
Whiskey and the Fountainhead
And though you were younger
Still you stole the first kiss
Well it seems so long ago
We were just kids

Brother I thought that you would be there till the end
You were my rock upon which I could always depend
Together we fought and never left each other's side
Brother I reached out but you were taken by the tide
Taken by the tide

We swam in cenotes in southern Mexico
Though the water was warm
Well the cracks had started to show
You watched the Pacific Sunrise on New Year's Day
Next to me but your heart was a million miles away

Brother I thought that you would be there till the end
"You are my watchman," I said, "You are my best friend"
"It's time for me to go," so softly you replied
Brother I reached out but you were taken by the tide
You were taken by the tide

The lights are on
No one is home
You've gone away
The lights are on
No one is home
You've gone away

Brother I thought that you would be there till the end
You and I know we said some things we never meant
Forever our dreams will burn upon the funeral pyre
Brother I reached out but you were taken by the tide
