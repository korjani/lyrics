This song
Is one I never thought that I'd play
But if you want me gone
There are kinder ways to say
So long than spitting in my face

They don't teach these things at school
They just lay down the rules which are there for you to break
Which are there for you to break

If I'm wrong
Then dust me off and put me in my place, but
Drop a bomb
Shall you blow me away without even a trace?
I'll be gone and I won't give chase

'Cause when you're in pieces, you pick up the bits, and nothing fits, and the wind blows
You away
Oh, the wind blows you away
Oh, the wind blows you away
Oh, the wind blows you away

I pray
There will come a time when I think of you and I'll smile
These days
Everything seems to last only a while
Remember the names
For the day when we'd have a child

But the trouble with dreams, they're not what they seem, 'cause when you awake,
They fall through your fingers
In flakes
They fall through your fingers in flakes
They fall through your fingers in flakes
They fall through your fingers in flakes
