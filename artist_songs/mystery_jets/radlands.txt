I've heard there's a place where we go to die
It's a terribly overrated horse-shit shaped hole in the sky
Kick off your heels and come with me tonight
And we'll pack up your car and we'll board up the house
And we'll die for our country though it never loved us
And it didn't need us these wonderful wonderful people
We'll redefine love in these papers and cry

So may the bridges we burn light the way
Out of the darkness of where we have been
Though at times it may feel like a lie
We both know nothing is quite as it seems
When the debris comes falling from the sky
Heaven will still be ours

Load up Old Bill's twelve-gauge and meet me by the lake
There's a place I know where nobody goes down by the old interstate
The future gets shorter the longer we wait
So let's step on the gas and if they come to find us
We'll run to the hills they say hills never loved us
But since we were children these wonderful wonderful people
We'll redefine love on our tombstones and cry

But someone will get all the glory
But I'll have yours and you'll have mine, you'll have mine

So may the bridges we burn light the way
Out of the darkness of where we have been
Though at times it may feel like a lie
We both know nothing is quite as it seems
And I know when I look into the deep blue of your eyes
Heaven will still be ours

We'll be together until hell,
Until hell, until hell freezes over
Until hell, until hell,
Until hell, freezes over.
Together until hell, until hell
Until hell, freezes over.
Until hell, until hell,
Until hell, freezes over.

So may the bridges we burn light the way
Out of the darkness of where we have been
Though at times it may feel like a lie
We both know nothing is quite as it seems
Then when the world is itself about to die
Our story will still play itself on the screens
And all these stars that come falling from the sky
Will always be ours
