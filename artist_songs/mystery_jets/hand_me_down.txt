You get high 'cause you've got low self-esteem
You toy with the boy on the football team
I've Seen you all over him just like a rash
Come home in bruises but always take him back

Do you love him?
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will but maybe you won't
Do you love him?
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you do

Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around

Is it 'cause your daddy was never around
And he's the closest thing to him that you've found?
Tell me if this is too close to the bone
But things hurt the most when they're nearest to home

Do you love him?
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will but maybe you won't
Do you love him?
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you do

Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around

Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't

Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around
Your heart is like a hand me down
Some thing to pass around and around

Your heart is like a hand me down
Your heart is like a hand me down
