If I could take over this world that we're in
I wanna reach out to every human being
I'll take all the sorrows from every goodbye
I'll shed all the tears so no one ever needs to cry
But...

Nobody cares for me
Nobody here needs me
A love to share but
Nobody dares
Nobody cares for me

I'll summon the oceans to drown every pain
I wanna be shelter to the countless in shame
Erase every conflict from every divide
I wanna give every little thing 'til I die
Singing...

Nobody cares for me
Nobody here needs me
A love to share but
Nobody dares
Nobody cares for me
