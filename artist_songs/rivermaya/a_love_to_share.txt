If I could take over this world that we're in
I wanna reach out to every human being
I'll take all the sorrows from every goodbye
I'll she'd all the tears so no one ever needs to cry
But...
[Chorus:]
Nobody cares for me
Nobody here needs me
A love to share but
Nobody dares
Nobody cares for me
I'll summon the oceans to drown every pain
I wanna be shelter to the countless in shame
Erase every conflict from every divide
I wanna give every little thing 'til I die
Singing...
[Chorus]
[Ad lib]
