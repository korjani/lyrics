I hear you prayin' 
Your dreams would be takin' you far from here 
(far away) 
So tired of waiting 
Your heart must be breaking in two 
While you do 
With all the things in the world that you're trying to do 
Does what I'm trying to say 
get thru 
to you 

[Chorus]
Wish that I could read your mind 
Understand what you hide in your heart 
Then maybe, baby, I could help you see how loved you are 
Wish that I could find the words 
That would echo inside of your soul 
'Cause then, my friend, you'd know 
He loves you so 
God loves you so 
I have a confession 
For all your hard questions 
The answers may not seem clear 
There's no use pretending 
'Cause we're all out here spinning our wheels so it feels 
Only one knows your heart 
what you hope to become 
Do you know who you're running from or to 

[Chorus]
My love is strong but not strong enough 
I'll give you all that I have 
it wouldn't matter that much 
So instead of promises 
I'll just be honest 
'Cause I won't always be around 
And I know my love will let you down

[Chorus]
