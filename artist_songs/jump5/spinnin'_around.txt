I was thinkin' 'bout it yesterday
I was thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
In a dizzy kinda sorta way, like vertigo
I've been tryin' hard to figure out
But it's drivin' me crazy
Well you'd think I'd know by now
A is last, Z is first
Living life in reverse
'Cause that's the way it works

[Chorus]

Spinnin' around
I've got this funny feeling
Turnin' my whole world upside down
I'll keep my heart, my eyes on You
'Cause you keep me spinnin' around..Spinnin' around
What we're doing doesn't have a sequel
Don't wanna lose your balance
Oh, you know you gotta keep your equilibrium
Goin' back to go forward
All these definite maybe's
It's like running around in circles
Make it last, take it slow
Just forget what you know
'Cause that's the way it goes

[Chorus]

Every now and then I feel your peacefulness surround me
Then once again it all goes
Up and down and over under
'Round and around
Go, Go, Go, Jump, Jump, Go, Go, Go J5
Spinnin' around, oh yeah, yea
Upside down, oh yeah yeah
J5 in the house, hey
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Turnin' turnin' upside down-down
'Cause you're spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' me around-round
Go-jump-go-jump-go-jump-go-jump
Spinnin' around, that's the way it works
Take it slow and not so fast (fast)
Z is first and A is last (last)
Up and down, all around (hey, hey)
Turnin' my whole world upside down
It's not the take
it's the give
Yes that's the way, okay
The way it is

[Chorus]
