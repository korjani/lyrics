[Verse 1:]
It's about friends
It's about school
It's about changes
The ones you never thought they'd put you through
It's times like these that I got a touch of Irish in me
And we can talk honesty, but honestly
I'm OK this way, ya

[Chorus:]
Hey, ya just don't understand
Sometimes my sky's a little gray
And I know eventually I'll be feeling alright again, ya
Life's been a friend to me
And don't need to convince me
It's a beautiful world, I know
It's a beautiful world

[Verse 2:]
It's about faith
It's about heart
It's about progress
The things that try to tell the world apart
My mind has to speak
'Cause I feel what I feel much too deep
It even motivates me to do something good
And I'm OK, this way, ya

[Chorus:]
Hey, ya just don't understand
Sometimes my sky's a little gray
And I know eventually I'll be feeling alright again, ya
Life's been a friend to me
And don't need to convince me
It's a beautiful world, I know
It's a beautiful world

[Bridge:]
Sunshine, beating down on my life
Maybe that's a long time away
But I guess I'll take it day by day
You ask when I'll get my smile back
When I tell you
I can smile now
Though I know I'm down
And if you stay around it might just happen

Hey, ya just don't understand a thing
Sometimes my sky's a little gray
And I know eventually I'll be feeling alright again, ya

It's about you
It's about me
It's about trust
And all the things we feel we'll never see
I feel so much
Sometimes I'm a little out of touch
You can talk good as day
but honestly, I'm OK, this way

[Chorus:]
Hey, ya just don't understand
Sometimes my sky's a little gray
And I know eventually I'll be feeling alright again, ya ya
Life's been a friend to me
And don't need to convince me
It's a beautiful world, I know
It's a beautiful world

Hey, It's a beautiful world
Sometimes my sky's a little gray
Life's been a friend to me
And don't need to convince me
It's a beautiful world, I know
It's a beautiful world
