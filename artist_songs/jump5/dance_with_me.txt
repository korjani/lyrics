C'mon c'mon c'mon hey hey
C'mon and dance with me hey hey hey

[Verse 1:]
I tell you something you gotta know it's true
From the first moment I laid eyes on you
Saw something special
Saw something I need

[Pre-chorus 1:]
Something so perfect it's hard to believe
Some things in live you know you just can't explain
The rest you just don't need to know

[Chorus:]
C'mon and dance with me
Dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason
Give me a sign
Let's get this party started
C'mon and dance with me tonight

C'mon c'mon c'mon hey (yeah) hey (yeah)
C'mon and dance with me
Hey hey hey

[Verse 2:]
With just a smile you can make my knees weak
Forget my name and the day of the week
You make me crazy
The things you can do
My head is spinning with thoughts of you

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Now here he comes he walking over to me
Is it real
Or is it Fantasy?

[Chorus:]
C'mon and dance with me
Dance with me tonight We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason
Give me a sign
Let's get this party started
C'mon and dance with me tonight

Dance with me (with me) c'mon and dance
Dance with me (with me) c'mon
Dance with me (with me) c'mon and dance
Dance with me (with me) c'mon

[Chorus:]
C'mon and dance with me
Dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason
Give me a sign
Let's get this party started
C'mon and dance with me tonight
Dance with me
Dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason
Give me a sign
Let's get this party started
C'mon and dance with me tonight
Dance with me
Dance with me tonight
We're gonna bring the house down until the daylight
So give me a reason
Give me a sign
Let's get this party started
C'mon and dance with me tonight
