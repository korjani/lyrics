Joy to the world the Lord is come 
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains 
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Joy to the world the Lord is come 
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
and heaven, and heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above
