[Verse 1:]
I don't watch sad re-runs
I wanna feel the new day that comes
And If I make mistakes, oh well, that's alright
I'd rather fall and take the sting
Then let somebody clip my wings
I know eventually
I'll learn to fly, ya ya

[Chorus:]
I see the world how it could it be
Dreaming in color
It looks so beautiful to me
Dreaming in color
In reds and blues a thousands hues
Coming in clear and bright
We don't have to live in black and white
Dreaming in color
Na na na na na na na na...

[Verse 2:]
When everything is looking gray
And nothings really going my way
Everyvbody tells me that I shoot too high
I don't let it shake me, no no
There's a secret place that I go
All I have to do is stop
And I close my eyes, ya ya

[Chorus:]
I see the world how it could it be
Dreaming in color
It looks so beautiful to me
Dreaming in color
In reds and blues a thousands hues
Coming in clear and bright
We don't have to live in black and white
Dreaming in color
Na na na na na na na na...

[Bridge:]
Is there to touch
Is there to feel
The world I've been dreaming of
One day I will make it real

I see the world how it could it be
Ya ya
And I close my eyes... ya ya ya

[Chorus:]
I see the world how it could it be
Dreaming in color
It looks so beautiful to me
Dreaming in color
In reds and blues a thousands hues
Coming in clear and bright
We don't have to live in black and white
Dreaming in color
Na na na na na na na na...
