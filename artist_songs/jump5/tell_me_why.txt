Although I'll never deserve it 
I realize that You will give me all of Your love 
I couldn't ever return it 
I know that I could never give You reason enough 
Your love came over me 
You found the way to my heart 

[Chorus]

Tell me why 
What have I done 
I got You 
Now You'll always be the one 
Tell me how 
Can this be true 
I'm with You 
Now I really wanna know 
Tell me why 
Let everybody believe it 
I want the world to see the kind of love that we've got 
Deep down in me I can feel it 
I'm gonna give You all I have and no matter what 
Your love came over me 
You found the way to my heart 

[Chorus]

I'm gonna wait no longer 
To show how I really feel 
My love is growing stronger 
You're all that I need 
You are my love for life 
Nothing can tear us apart 

[Chorus]
