Y'know, you gotta roll with the punches (uh-huh)
Take some bumps, give some bruises (exactly)
Its easy to just give it all up, or just quit and say fuck it
Its hard to keep going

When it all seems hopeless, real hard to focus
Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal, easily insulted
Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is
Ain't scared to die, but you thinking 'bout a coffin
And quitting ain't an option but you think about it often
Saying to yourself, how this ain't fair
You got the strength but the energy, just ain't there
That same vision that you used to have just ain't clear
The storm gets heavier, the sun disappears
You just hoping that there's light, at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel
Get a different mind-frame once you been through the jungle
But you can stumble on a hit, and get rich on a humble
Least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

[Hook - Chayse (Jadakiss):]
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go, ah-haa)
We got one more mile to go

First the depression kicks in, then you get animal-like
Hate can turn to motivation if you channel it right
Its like you at a seminar, on the panel of life
If you don't reach the destination they don't hand you your stripes
And the work is just keeping my name alive more
All I'm tryna do is finish the game with a high-score
I done laughed and cried and then laughed and cried more
And I know what I want, so don't ask cause I'm sure
From a cloth that no longer exists, self-cut
Every time you look back you just throwin' yourself up
At least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

[Hook - Chayse (Jadakiss):]
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go

[Chayse:]
And even if I lost everything, I'll keep going
And even if they try to break me down, I'll keep hoping for better times, hey
Lemme hear you say, ho
Lemme hear you say, hey
Lemme hear you say, yeah

[Hook - Chayse (Jadakiss):]
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (yeah)
We got one more mile to go (we ain't gon' never stop)
We got one more mile to go (ha ha ha, I know they want us to)
We got one more mile to go (you know what it is)
