Handgun on the hip you know I got the AR
High profile from the hood on the radar
You ridin over here, I dont know if they are
I still cant believe a record company can pay y'all
I aint gotta tell you whats good you should cop this
Hospital beds, gernies wood boxes
Top chefs, great attorneys, good doctors
Movies that were made on the block got Hood Oscars
Yea, im gettin mine on the back end
Unwrap em' weigh em' and put em' back in 
Yup, cause even the best die,
Break a few of em down but im lettin the rest fly 
Goin thru changes, but they are not dangerous
Get dope money but speakin cocaine game language
Explain this, either you soft or a criminal 
The murder rate got the hate on subliminal
Always raspy till the day they blast me 
Im project elevator hallway nasty 
He don do half he need all his cash be
Put a nigga in the casket off cast be
Im all in the Daily News checkin out Jeter
Two Pits off the leash Quadna then Benita
And you keep lyin thats why its hard to believe ya 
Gon need a free safety to guard the reciever
Now, when you dealin with a clown 
Only pay your respect before they put him in the ground
When the birds land nigga guess who put em in the town
So the pitchers is out, guess who put em on the mound
3 button purple label go wit the cargo 
A African American version of Pablo
Niggas still hatin they can kiss my ass
Get a hard on when I count that cash
Still hatin they can kiss my ass [x2]
