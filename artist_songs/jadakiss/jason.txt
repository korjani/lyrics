[Swizz Beats:]
You got me feeling like I ain't winning
I'm starting from the beginning
I go Forrest, go Forrest
I make so much fucking money, yeah I go Forrest
These rims ain't for sale, bitch
This whip ain't for sale, bitch
And this Cuban ain't for sale, bitch
I been on the fucking boat like a sail bitch
500 feet on the fucking water
Ten fucking karats for my baby daughter
You come through boy, place your order
I got some niggas that'll meet you at the fucking border

[Hook - Swizz Beats & (Jadakiss):]
I got my hoodie and my mask on
I got my gun and my blast on
(Don't shoot please, can't breathe
Officer don't shoot, can't breathe)

[Jadakiss:]
I'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes
Even niggas is jealous so they just want you to die
They don't want you to rise, they just want you demise
So I be crossing my T's and I be dotting my I's
You on the opposite side, shots gonna fly
Best part about it, I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide
Keep a gun in the door, that's all in the ride
Til my niggas come home, free all of the guys
This shit is all a facade, thought it was all a surprise
I heard of the stories, seen all of the lies
Long as the work is official, and the corner supplied
At the end of the day niggas, we gonna survive
What

[Jadakiss:]
I'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes
Can't figure it out or they don't wanna decide
In the gutter replying, mic flooded with dimes
Send you ass, I'ma hit you with the butt of the nine
Bullets soaking in pine, let 'em open your spine
Use your brain a little, my nigga open your mind
If you ain't in the circle, for a square I get you line
I know niggas is telling, I don't care about the time
Yeah I got weed on me, I don't care about the fine
From a hood where niggas don't give a fuck by design
Yeah, it's real life, it's not a rhyme
And remember, if you don't get caught it's not a crime
Like
