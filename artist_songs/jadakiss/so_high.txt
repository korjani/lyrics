I’m so high you can barely see me
Do you know the feeling of being so high?

Between love and hate it’s a fine line
So I stay parallel to the sky line
THC levels is through the roof
When you floating in the clouds you can view the truth
Hush feel the rush from the altitude
Looks down on em see what they about to do
So you already know what not to do
That Moroccan hashish is like rocket fuel
Yea sometimes it better not to see the ground
Yea sometimes it better not to be around
Always keep a couple dollars and a P around
I might experience turbulence when I see the town
The worlds under me
I’m where the lightning and the thunder be
Cause down there ain't no fun to me
With that said I ain't going back
I’m bout to blow a sack and I all know is that

[Hook:]
I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Rollin up tryna get folded up
How you gonna say you cold as us
Can’t smoke enough
Diamonds in my chain nah homie they 14 karats
Lil nigga that ain't gold enough
Staying on top while this haters praying I stop and
You niggas waiting on cars while I pull em strain out the lot
Catch me rolling that reefer I stay on that pot
And I’m always repping for my gang I know I say that a lot
Cause I can remember the days before I got paid
Me and my niggas was trying to make our way
We getting on fuck what y'all say
Made some millions and got niggas with me tryna do the same thing
I Make moves bossed up in the game
Ball hard don’t get crossed up in the game
Seen alotta dudes get loss up in the game
That’s why every time you see me

[Hook:]
I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away
I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away

High as the towers before they knocked them down
Teflon like Gotti before they locked him down
Word to the mollies niggas in poppin now
But I’m just chillin just passing the pot around light up

[Hook:]
I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away
