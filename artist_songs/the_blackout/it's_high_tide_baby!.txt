Is this worth fighting for
You're worth fighting for
As I face the crowd and take a bow
This time its up to you
Time is up for me
Cause I've been biting my tongue for far too long
I know that I'm too blame
Burst into flames (you're beautiful)
You're worth fighting for
I'm worth fighting for (don't say goodbye)
You're worth fighting for

Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime
Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime

Is this worth fighting for
Are you worth fighting for
As I face the crowd and take a bow
This time its up to you
Time is up for me
Cause I've been biting my tongue for far too long
I know that I'm too blame
Burst into flames (you're beautiful)
You're worth fighting for
We're worth fighting for
Say goodbye
(You're worth fighting for)

Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime
Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime

Sing for me
Sing for me
Sing for me

Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime
Woah ohh
Woah ohh
I apologize for the summertime

I'll never forget you
This is my only choice
You'll never forgive me
I'd die and wait for you
