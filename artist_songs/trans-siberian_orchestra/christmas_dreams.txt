Somewhere beyond where the light rarely goes 
Somewhere beyond where the dark barely breathes 
Somewhere this night where the dark only knows 

She awaits ever patient 
She awaits rarely seen 
But her moments are taken 
For in the dead of the night 
Gathering light 
Christmas dreams 

I want to wrap all my moments around her 
I want to watch as she glitters the night 
Floats her dreams in the air 
People watch, children stare 
At these tears of captured light 

While she awaits ever patient 
She awaits rarely seen 
Still her moments are taken 
For in the dead of the night 
Gathering light 
Christmas dreams 

And a tear falls upon her snow-white hair 
And it runs to the end where it lingers there 
Then it falls through the air of a winter's sky 
Till it captures a dream and it's crystalized 

Let it go! 
Let it go! 
This old world that i know 

For soon everything will be changing 
In a single glance 
Where it all enchants 
And every hope is worth saving 

And a tear falls upon her snow-white hair 
And it runs to the end where it lingers there 
Then it falls through the air of a winter's sky 
Till it captures a dream and it's crystalized 

Let it go! 
Let it go! 
This old world that i know 

For soon everything will be changing 
In a single glance 
Where it all enchants 
And every hope 
Every hope 
Every hope is worth saving
