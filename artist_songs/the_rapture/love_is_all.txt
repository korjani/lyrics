Love is all my crippled soul will ever need.
Love is all my crippled soul will ever need.
It's ok to feel this way,
It's ok-
It doesn't matter anyway.

Love is all my crippled soul will ever need
and time will take a bigger part, a-part of me.
well tonite, your la-love is all i need. 
Your love, yea your love is all i need.

Sun goes up and sun goes down
I dig love and just having you around

Love is all
