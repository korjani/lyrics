In the grace of your love
You don't turn me away
In the grace of your love
There is no other way

In the grace of your love
Every day when I wake up
In the grace of your love
In the grace of your love

In the grace of your love
I know we can find a way
In the grace of your love
We can find a brighter day

In the grace of your love
Please don't turn me down
In the grace of your love
Oh don't push me around

In the grace of your love
I am scared and I'm sick
In the grace of your love
Please don't hurt me so quick

Heaven
Don't want you dead

In the grace of your love
I see you shining inside
In the grace of your love
No one can ever die

In the grace of your love
Every day when I wake up
In the grace of your love
In the grace of your love
