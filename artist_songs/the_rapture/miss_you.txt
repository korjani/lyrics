Never thought I would miss you
But oh how I miss you
Always thought I could forget you
But I can't forget you

When I see your face
It just tears me up inside
I want to run I want to shake off this feeling
Feeling I have for you

Why can't you let me go
What did I ever do to you
Why can't you let me know
What did I ever do to you

Broken dreams and broken faces
I've run all the darkest races
Get out of me respect what I say
Get out of me you hurt me everyday

Oh how I miss you
I miss you there

Always thought I could ditch you
But oh I can't ditch you
You know I always love sleeping
Now I'm just weeping

Oh how I wake up scared
My breath you left me
??? spinning and reeling
Darkness collapse on me

Why can't you let me go
What did I ever do to you
Why can't you let me know
What did I ever do to you

Broken dreams and broken faces
I've run all the darkest races
Get out of me respect what I say
Get out of me you hurt me everyday

Oh how I miss you
I miss you there

Always thought I could kill you
But oh I can't kill you
Always thought I could forget you
But I can't forget you

When will a ray of light
Lift my own self-hatred
I've got to let go of this feeling
Poison I have for you

Why can't you let me go
What did I ever do to you
Why can't you let me know
What did I ever do to you

Broken dreams and broken faces
I've run all the darkest races
Get out of me respect what I say
Get out of me you hurt me everyday

Oh how I miss you
I miss you there
