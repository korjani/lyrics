mothers in a lawn chair 
electric come to get in 
verbal litigation 
out of the races and in to the track 
punishment in higher places 
people they are weird 
and people they act strange 
get yourself together

and take yourself for rent 
all i see is all i see is all i see is 
punishment in higher places
