Hi-i-i-i-i-igh

High, high as the sky
Low, low as it goes
Purple dragons fly into your eyes
Milkshake shimmy, cry and cry and cry

You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me fly
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me fly

High, high as the sky
Low, low as it goes
Words that cut, slash, rip, and hypnotize
Why'd you say those things, why'd you lie?

You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me fly
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me fly

Hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Hi-i-i-i-i-igh

Knobs, knobs to turn
Love, love that burns
Paint over this brokenhearted life
You are so fucked up, I wish you'd die

You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me fly
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me fly
