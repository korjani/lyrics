Blue bird on my shoulder
Let me tell you
What I did

My heart got broke
I wrote a note
It didn't change a thing

Woke up one day
The sky was black
I couldn't remember anything

Sparrow on the wind
Life is narrow
When you carry every thing you did

It'll beat you up
And put you down
Your head will be
Far underground

But don't give up
Look the light
I'll see you on the other side
