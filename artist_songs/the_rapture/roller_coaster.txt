Roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coast
Rises rises

Your life's a roller coaster she said
And I want to get off
It's just hurting my head
And I want it to stop

Roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coast
Rises rises

I know I hurt your head
But if you leave I'll be dead
You're the only thing I'd get out of bed for these days
Forevermore

Is there someway to work it out
Please say there is
I'm begging you darling
I know it hasn't been so great
It's not too late
Come to me
Stay with me

Roller coaster roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coaster roller coast
Roll with me darling

Is there someway to work it out
Please say there is
I'm begging you darling
I know it hasn't been so great
It's not too late
Come to me
Stay with me
