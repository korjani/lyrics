Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart

When you're sad and lonely
And your mind sees you only
Take a chance you can fight it
Open up your heart

When your sick incomplete
Watch the stars not your feet
Feel the wind blow on your mind
Now your seeing blind

Fight the urge to say no
Bring your friends then you'll know
Come inside step away
kill your fears today

Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart

Kick the habit you have learned
You can do it you've been burned
When your sick eyes need a turn
Let the future learn

Open up your heart
