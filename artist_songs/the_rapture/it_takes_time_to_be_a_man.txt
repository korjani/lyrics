Well we're all getting bigger
But it takes time to be a man
And it's more than you figure
Well take it slow and take my hand

And there's room at the mountaintop
For everyone in God's plan
So just trust in your brother
Let me help you if I can

Oh yeah

I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try

And there's faith in the answer
We all swear on this land
And the birds they are singing
From the place that we stand

Oh yeah

I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try

Well there's room in your heart now
For excellence to take a stand
And there's tears that need shedding
It's all part of the plan

Oh yeah

I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try

Hallelujah hallelujah
