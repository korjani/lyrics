Get yourself together! 
Get out of your head
Without outer persuasions
You're better off dead
Learn how to breathe
You'd better learn how to shine
These obser-ma-vations
Are mah-ma-ma, mah-ma-ma
Muh-ma-ma-ma-mine

Down on your knees 
Pleading for life
Shards of a mirror
And twist of a knife
So get yourself together
Unwrapped ball of twine
These obser-ma-vations
Are mah-ma-ma, mah-ma-ma
Muh-ma-ma-ma-mine

No
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-no
