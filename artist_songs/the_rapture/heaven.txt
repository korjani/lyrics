I'm floating in a constant heaven

I can't believe that you came here today 
And took me away
And you took me away
I can't believe that you came her today
And took me away
Took me away

And if you focus very hard
the train will come for you at last
And if you're stuck out in the yard

I can't believe that you came here today
And took me away
And you took me away
Too much condition and not enough game
It's driving me sane
Driving me sane
