Love and hope and trust today
Is what i think i'd like to say
Can you see me standing here?
Can you help me with my fears?
Is there a way to come to you?
Live forever, just we two
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there
Don't ever give up your dreams
And all good things will come to thee
Don't give up your ever hope
Life is laughing
Can you cope?
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there
If you're lost and you can't live
Alone inside your tiny head
If you call and no-one comes
Look to me
I'm in the sun
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be there
Songs i long lost gave to you
In your heart
And in your shoes
Left a passion
Pent up pain
Songs in motion
Songs in vain
This i cannot give to you
All together, all with glue
Valentines and shopping malls
When you left me, i was small
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be there
