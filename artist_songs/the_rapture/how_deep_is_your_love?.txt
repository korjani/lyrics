All the love that you're giving me
It helps me see what's right
All my life now you've given me
A chance to see your light

All the feeling I have for you
Let it come on through
When I cry you heal my pain
Help me come to you

On down the dead-end street
It's in my feet behind
Sun is shining right on my face
This is the place to find

When it's dark your tears are few
It's just me and you
Give me what I need to live
Help me come to you

Let me hear that song

On this journey you've given me
I'm walking off the time
Now you're walking right next to me
The mountains we will climb

All the feeling I have for you
Standing in your shoes
When I cry you heal my pain
Help me come unglued

Let me hear that song

How deep is your love
Oh how deep is your love

Let me hear that song
How deep is your love
Oh how deep is your love

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
