You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love

Every day you pick me up and
Put me down
Feels so good inside while
You're around
Lift me high and hold me there
Safe and sound
Feels so good inside while
You're around

You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love

Never never never gonna see ya
Never never die again

You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love

Every day you pick me and
Put me down
Feels so good inside while
You're around
Lift me high and hold me there
Safe and sound
Feels so good inside while
You're around

You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love

Never never never gonna see ya
Never never die again
