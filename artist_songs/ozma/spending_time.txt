Eastern time, central time, slow down 
If you're racing time and chasing time, slow down 
You're buying time and spending time, slow down 
You're killing time, precious time, slow down 
The borderline is in your mind, slow down 
Once you've crossed it, then you've lost it 
No sense looking back 
Let the minutes take you with them 
No sense keeping track 

Where we'll go we just don't know 
All we have is time to rocket slowly through the galaxy 
Or two or three, 'til we break free 

Finding time, losing time, slow down 
Bending time, breaking time, slow down 
Any time you've got the time slow down 
'cause the borderline is in your mind 

Once you go there then you'll be there every tuesday night 
TV's jumping to the ceiling 
Watch that kid take flight 

Where we'll go we still don't know 
But we'll take our time to rocket slowly through the galaxy or two or three 
'til we break free from time was just a line 
That we kept in mind but never thought we'd cross 'til we got lost 
Yeah the borderline is in your mind
