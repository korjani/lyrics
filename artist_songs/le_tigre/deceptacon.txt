Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see yr disco disco dik is sucking my heart out of my mind
I'm outta time, I'm outta fuckin time
I'm a gasoline gut with a vaseline mind but
Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme
One, two, three, four
You got what you been asking for
Yr so policy free and yr fantasy wheels and everything you think
And everything you feel is alright,
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 

I take you home now watch me get you hot
Yr just a parrot when yr screaming
And yr shouting "More crackers please, more crackers please"
You want what you want but you don't wanna be on yr knees
Who does your/ who does your hair? 

Who took the Bomp from the Bompalompalomp? 
Who took the Ram from the Ramalamading dong? 
Who took the Bomp from the Bompalompalomp? 
Who took the Ram from the Ramalamading dong? 

You bought a new van the first year of yr band
Yr cool and I hardly wanna say "not"
Because I'm so bored that I'd be entertained
Even by a stupid fuckin linoleum floor, linoleum floor
Yr lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor
I'll walk on it
I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two
Who? Who? Who? Who? 

Who took the Bomp from the Bompalompalomp? 
Who took the Ram from the Ramalamading dong? 
Who took the Bomp from the Bompalompalomp? 
Who took the Ram from the Ramalamading dong?
