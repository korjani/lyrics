The phone keeps ringing and it just won't stop 
There's a paper napkin in my coffeepot 
People freaking out on me left and right 
My head feels heavy but my feet feel light 

The clock keeps ticking inside my head 
Bad news is all I ever get 
The check I've been waiting for is not on time 
Everyone around me wants to start another fight 

I'm gonna let it be alright 
(I wanna be there!) 
(I wanna take you there!) 
(I wanna be there!) 
(I wanna take you there!)
