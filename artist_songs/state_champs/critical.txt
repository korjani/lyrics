I’ve always wanted what I can’t have
and I’ve been making it a note to feel what’s left to feel
and put my shoulder to the wheel
Everything about me used to have a mind of it’s own
I’ve got what’s left of me, some positivity
and no more waiting on a dial tone 
because I’ve loved and lost a cause
and that’s enough to never let you forget me

We’ve been gone for too long to see this happen again
Then again, you’re too gone to say that’s not what you meant
You’re crying, I’m not trying
I won’t let this life get so critical

Remember the time you asked me to let go?
Where did you want me to begin?
Take a stand
You know you haven’t got what you came for
and recently, my counter seems to be the place to be at night
You were right, I must be wrong for wanting you to know
I let go of the old
and you don’t deserve to see where it leads me to be
and doesn’t that make you question why we were here in the first place?

We’ve been gone for too long to see this happen again
Then again, you’re too gone to say that’s not what you meant
You’re crying, I’m not trying
I won’t let this life get so critical

I’m like a boy lost in a city
not wanting to be found
Everything is a sight to see until you come back around
I’m like a boy lost in a city
not wanting to be found
Everything is a site to see until you come back around

We’ve been gone for too long to see this happen again
Then again, you’re too gone to say that’s not what you meant
You’re crying, I’m not trying
I won’t let this life get so critical
