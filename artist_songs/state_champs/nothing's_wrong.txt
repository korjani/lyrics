Personally, I think I'd much prefer to stay. 
Between you and me, there's too much standing in the way. 
But you'll go on; 
keeping everything in belief as you sip on something strong, 
wishing you could make your own history. 

All in all, I'm doubting everything lately. 
So tell me, what's it like to fly? 

Here's to something that you said would be nothing. 
I braced myself for this (Only you could ever hold me back)
Here's to hoping you put thought in your judgement, 
or this is how it ends. (This is how it ends)

January, I took the time to settle down.
Between you and me, that stress comes crawling back, 
but you'll go on; saying "can you sing to me?" and pretend that nothing's wrong. 
We still know it's not how it used to be. 

All in all, I'm doubting everything lately.

Here's to something that you said would be nothing.

Here's to hoping you put thought in your judgement, 
or this is how it ends. (This is how it ends)

And all this time we could be changing our ways to find out

We've been here before.
Nothing ends up the same.
We've been here before. 
The promises made fuel the game.
