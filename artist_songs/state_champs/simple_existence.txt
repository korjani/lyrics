I'm in a wasteland, but nevertheless
I can try to see this clearly
And I can say that
The day that we met
I just had to have you near me

I fell asleep in a city that doesn't
Thought I was special but you know I wasn't
It's just hard to believe that I won't be
Held responsible, for the things that you now know

I'm coming for you
I'm coming to make sure everything I heard is true
What's it like to be the one who waited 
Long enough to see the day that I could feel again
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you and your simple existence

Let's re-arrange this
When everything falls, I can't make out all the signals
But it's strange that
The distance is how we keep it so original

I fell asleep in a city that doesn't
Thought I was special but you know I wasn't
It's just hard to believe that I won't be
Held responsible, for the things that you now know

I'm coming for you
I'm coming to make sure everything I heard is true
What's it like to be the one who waited 
Long enough to see the day that I could feel again
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you and your simple existence

Hearing all the words you kept inside your head
When the struggle came to construct these lies instead
No telling you where this will go
But as long as you know

You're responsible, for the things that you now know

I'm coming for you (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm coming to make sure everything I heard is true (you know it's true)
What's it like to be the one who waited 
Long enough to see the day that I could feel again (I could feel again)
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you and your simple existence
