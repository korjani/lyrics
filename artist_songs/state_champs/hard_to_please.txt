You've got a plan inside a deep breath,
but it always comes out the same. 
I never said there'd be a last chance.
Looks like I'm leaving the fast lane. 

I've been told to find The Finer Things,
but you know that won't make sense to me. 
You followed your past mistakes.
Whether you bend or break, 
I still wait for you to cope. 

But you ignored 
the call 'cause you grew up. 
You'll be thinking all 
our memories have made you hard to please now.

Maybe I'm a bad person. 
Maybe I don't wanna walk before I crawl.
It only matters if it's worth it,
so does it even matter at all? 

Maybe I'm a bad person. 
Maybe I don't wanna walk before I crawl. 
It only matters if it's worth it.
I think I'm just afraid to fall.

But you ignored
the call 'cause you grew up. 
You'll be thinking all
our memories have made you hard to please now. 

Take what's left, make it your last request.
I think it's obvious we'll both escape the selfishness 
before I'm gone.

I'm turning pages in a place that I know.
You've got your wages, but you've got nothing to show. 
I keep turning pages in a place that I know. 

It only matters if it's worth it. 
I think I'm just afraid to fall. 

Maybe I'm a bad person. 
Maybe I don't wanna walk before I crawl.
It only matters if it's worth it, 
so does it even matter at all?
