You caught me in the right place at the right time
So I'll just dive right in
Say you've got a blank space in your right mind
Well here's my second wind

Oh, your idea of me blown away, away
Something in the past tense didn't make sense for this to follow through
What did you expect to happen? Were you mad then
With nothing left to do?

Oh, you're making me sick. What is this?
Had we been drawn to close before?
Because I dropped my forgiveness, it's lying face down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Funny how we go way back and we said that
We wouldn't let this come between
Everything and is it true that I could look past
Memories and stay obscene?

Oh, your idea of me blown away, away
Something's telling me I never could have ruined everything you want in life
Because you never put in effort, and the truth is you were never doing it right

Oh, you're making me sick. What is this?
Am I the one you can't ignore?
Because I dropped my forgiveness, it's lying face down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold
But you stole your own self control
It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold so just know

It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold
But you stole your own self control
It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold so just know

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Not everybody wants an enemy
Call me the culprit and that's all you'll see
You were responsible for finding a way to catch on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone
