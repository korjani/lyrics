I'm drowning in metaphors, angry coz you didn't show, you're late again yeah
And the tears streaming down my face, I'm displaced like I feel I'm soaking wet
If you don't love me won't you leave?
I have tried but I can't seem to say Goodbye

[Chorus:]
I stand out in the rain here for hours
Looking like I feel inside
I can't give anymore than my heart
You shattered it a million times
At least you can see that I'm crying 
Out in the rain

I'm drowning in metaphors, angry coz stupid me's a fool again
Yeah I got to get over this, though I've missed you a little now and then
If I could just fall out of love I would leave
I have tried but I can't seem to say Goodbye

[Chorus]

I can't seem to walk away from all of this pain

[Chorus]

I stand out in the rain here for hours
Looking like I feel inside
I can't give anymore than my heart
You shattered it a million times
At least you can see that I'm crying
At least you can see that I'm dying
Out in the rain

I'm drowning in metaphors, angry coz you didn't show, you're late again 
I'm drowning in metaphors, angry coz you didn't show, you're late again
