[Verse 1:]
In this moment,
Everything suddenly makes sense
All the random pieces in my life are falling into place
In an instant
I am flying high and scared to death
Coz I wonder if you feel it to
I wanna be a part of you

[Chorus:]
If it's goodbye now forever
And I never get to see you again
If it's the last kiss
Before the world should end
I wanna thank you for the night of my life

[Verse 2:]
Well this feeling
Touch you and linger on your skin
Or like a feather in the wind
And blow away out into space
Will my memory
Haunt you and bring you back again
And I wonder if you need me to
Whether I'll be meeting you

[Chorus:]
If it's goodbye now forever
And I never get to see you again
If it's the last kiss
Before the world should end
I wanna thank you for the night of my life

Ohh
Don't go away
Stay with me and the sun will rise
In your eyes I will be all you need

[Chorus:]
If it's goodbye now forever
And I never get to see you again
If it's the last kiss
Before the world should end
I wanna thank you for the night of my life

Thank you
