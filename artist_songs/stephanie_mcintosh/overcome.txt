Silence shattered like it's glass
My world was captured like a photograph
When I saw you
Eyes of oceans pulled me in

The riptide was strong
And though I fought it for a second or two
You stole me with a glance and it was done
I was overcome by you...

[CHORUS]
Breathe me in and breathe me out
Crave and desire what I yearn for
Pray that I might feel the same
'Cos everynight and everyday
I wait for you
Looking for someone I almost knew
Why do I run, overcome?

The moments happen then they pass
But my obsession doesn't go that fast
Who are you and do I ever cross your mind?

Find me alone and kiss me softly as I wake to truth
My sleep is dead, my life has just begun

I am overcome by you...

[CHORUS]

How could I come so close?
What if I could spin the world like superman?
I let the moment go
Fast enough to fly me back to you again
I should have let it show
I would grab a hold and not let go...

Oh and kiss me softly as I wake to truth
My sleep is dead, my life has just begun

[CHORUS]
