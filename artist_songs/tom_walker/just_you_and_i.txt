Let's get drunk
I'll pour my heart out through my mouth
This year's been hard for us no doubt
Let's raise a glass to a better one
And all the things that we've overcome,
Are bring home to us 'cause,
Me and you, we can hold this out,
Only you understand how i'm feeling now, yea

And I know,
I can tell you anything,
You won't judge
You're just listening, yea
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
And one step at a time,
Just you and I
(Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one,
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I
(Just you and I)

Let's get drunk,
We'll reminisce about the days,
When we were broke, not getting paid
And taking trips at the weekend
When I would drop down to see you
And we would paint the town
Too many chugs, I'll be passing out
Cause I can never keep up
Quad vods, now I'm puking open

And I know,
I can tell you anything
You won't judge
You're just listening, yea
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
And one step at a time,
Just you and I
(Just you and I)
Cause you're the only one,
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I
(Just you and I)

Tired of chasing paper,
Staring at this screen
Been saving up for weeks now
Just to get to you my dear
And though you're far from my home,
This ain't no weekend bar
And oh my heart grows fonder,
Must be city love

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
And one step at a time,
Just you and I

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
And one step at a time,
Just you and I
Just you and I
'Cause you're the only one,
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I
(Just you and I)

Yea one step at a time, just you and I
Yea one step at a time, just you and I
