I don't know who you think you are
Or where the story ends
You won't say it to my face
But you say it to my friends
You're a kicking up a fuss
I don't know who to trust
Our whispers in no playground
Heaven knows we're old enough

You can talk that talk but it all comes back around
I'll give you something something to talk about
'Cause when you run your mouth like you run this town
Don't you think I don't know how it all went down
So talk that talk cause it all comes back around

'Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you

'Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you

Why you cooking in my kitchen
Making it your business
There ain't no truth in none of this
Can I get a witness
Won't you leave it all alone
And get up off your throne
No running your shit around
Just leave it all at home

You can talk that talk but it all comes back around
I'll give you something something to talk about

Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you

Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you

'Cause you get what you get
Why do they always fall, for it
And the truth, will come out, you'll be left for dead, left for dead

Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you

Cause I believe in karma
And you believe in drama. No no no no
You should try a little harder
Or karma is gonna come for you
