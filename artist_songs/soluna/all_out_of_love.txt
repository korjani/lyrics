I'm lying alone with my head on the phone 
Thinkin' of you till it hurts 
I know you hurt too, but what else can I do 
Tormented and torn apart 
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart 
For times when my life seems so low 
It would make me believe what tomorrow would bring 
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know 

[‘horus:]
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you 
I know you were right believing for so long 
I'm all out of love, what am I without you 
I can't be too late to say 
That I was so wrong 

I want you to come back and carry me home 
Away from these long lonely nights 
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too 
Does the feeling seem oh so right 
And what would you say if I called on you now 
And said that I can't hold on 
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day 
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone 

[‘horus]

Oh, what are you thinking of? 
What are you thinking of? 
Oh, what are you thinking of? 
What are you thinking of? 

[‘horus 3X]
