I hadn't anyone 'till you
I was a lonely one 'till you
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'till you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

I kept my love in secrecy
I put it under lock and key
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
