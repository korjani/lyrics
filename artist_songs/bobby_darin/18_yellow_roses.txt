Eighteen yellow roses came today
Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet
When the boy came to the door
I didn't know what to say
But eighteen yellow roses came today

I opened up the card
To see what it said
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I had read
Though you belong to another
I love you anyway
Yes eighteen yellow roses came today

I never doubted your love for a minute
I always thought that you would be true
But now this box and the flowers in it
I guess there's nothing left for me to do
But ask to meet the boy
That's done this thing
And find out if he's got plans 
To buy you a ring

Cuz eighteen yellow roses
Will wilt and die one day
But a fathers love, will never fade away
Will never fade away
