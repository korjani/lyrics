Hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name
Hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name

I hear a voice so sweet an' clear
Calling me angel an' a honey dear
Well, whoa-ho, hush, hush
Whoa-ho, hush, hush
Whoa-ho, hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name

Hush, I say hush
Somebody's calling my name
Whoa-o-o, won't you hush
Somebody's calling my name

If it's the girl I've been searching for
I'll tell the world I won't-a search no more
Now, whoa-ho hush, hush
Whoa-ho hush, hush
Whoa-ho hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name

Well, talk to my mother wouldn't do me no good
Talk to my brother wouldn't do me no good
I talked to the gypsy and she said, Rejoice
You'll know your lover by the sound of his voice

So hush, I say hush
Somebody's calling my name
Whoa now listen, won't you hush
Somebody's calling my name

I see my baby up on a hill
I love her now and I always will
So whoa-ho hush, hush
Whoa-ho hush, hush
Whoa-ho hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name, yeah

Somebody's calling my name, yeah
Somebody's calling my name, yeah
Somebody's calling my name
