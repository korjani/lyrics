Did you hear the story 'bout old Bullmoose?
He played piano, really tore it loose.
Whenever his heart was filled with gloom
He'd beat out a song in the old lunchroom.
All the guys and gals would gather 'round
Just to hear that Bullmoose sound.
Sayin'... 
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!

Bullmoose playin' on a Friday night
Two bad boys got up to fight.
One old man yelled, "Hey, keep quiet!"
The next thing you know they started a riot.
While everybody was-a jumpin' around
All you could hear was that Bullmoose sound.
Sayin'... 
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose, a-turn 'em loose!

Bullmoose goin' to a party one day
Everybody asked him, "Won't you sit down and play?"
When all of a sudden the room began to shake
"Whoops!" he cried, "It's a real earthquake."
While the people were fallin' into holes in the ground
All you could hear was that Bullmoose sound.
Sayin'... 
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose!
Go Bullmoose, come on Bullmoose!
Let me hear it like it is, Bullmo...
