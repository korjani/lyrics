When you see a guy 
Reach for stars in the sky
You can beat that he's doin' it 
For some doll. 

When you spot a John 
Waitin' out in the rain
Chances are he's insane 
As only a John can be for a Jane.  

When you meet the gent
Who pays all kinds of rent
For a flat that would just flatten
The Taj Mahal... 
Call it sad... call it funny
But it's better than even money
That the guy's only doin' it 
For some doll. 

When you see a dame
Change the shape of her frame
You can lay odds she's takin' if off 
For some guy. 

When you find a doll
With her diamond in hock
Bet your life that the rock
Is goin' to restock some gentlemen jock.

When... you see a mouse 
Hurry, scurry out of the house
And she runs twenty blocks
For cigars and rye... 
Call if dumb... say it's clever
But you can give odds forever
That the doll's only doin' it... 
The guy's havin' her do it ... 

Everybody's doin' it...
For... some guy...
