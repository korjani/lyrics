The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings, fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things

The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights, fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things

Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes like yours

You wonder why the nightingale sings
Lovers have wings, people wear rings
The world is full of beautiful things
Beautiful people, too
Beautiful people like you

Beautiful days of sun kissed showers
Beautiful sea kissed breeze
Beautiful nights of moon kissed hours
Beautiful dreams like these

Our lives tick by like pendulum swings
Delicate things, butterfly wings
Life is full of beautiful things
Beautiful people, too
Beautiful people like you

Like you, just like you, people like you
Beautiful people like you
