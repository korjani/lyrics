If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe, it's all true
Knowin', that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard
To live without, somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
And never think of myself

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way and I'd leave the past behind
Knowin', that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way and I'd leave the past behind
Knowin', that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
