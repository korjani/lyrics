Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say, "Hello"
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day

Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life thorough loving you

Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life thorough loving you

I'll find somebody, wait and see
Who am I kiddin', only me
'Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a helpless case

Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life thorough loving you
