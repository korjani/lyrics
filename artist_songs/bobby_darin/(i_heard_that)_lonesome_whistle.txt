I was riding number nine
Heading South from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal and my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, actin' smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was a too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
And tied me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear this shame
Well, I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
When that evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Til my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
'Cause I'm in Georgia, doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
