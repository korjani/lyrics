I'll be there
When all your dreams are broken
To answer your unspoken prayers
When the little things you're doing
Don't turn out right
Don't you worry darling 
I'll be there

I'll miss you 
And in my dreams I'll kiss you
And wish you luck on your new affair
So baby if you need me
All you have to do is call me
And don't you worry darling
I'll be there

There whenever you need to know
That there is someone who cares
So if your new love
Isn't a true love
Don't you worry darling
I'll be there

Ohh I'll be there
Don't you worry darling
Cuz you know I'll be there
Don't you worry...
