Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame

Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie there and toss about
So at a loss about you

How I wish my heart would leave
My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The joys we've known

I pray that someday
Our love will see the light
Till then in thick, dark silence
I beg my heart to replace

All through and, oh, so long
And sleepless night
