There's a story the Gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings
She belongs to you 
An old love story that's known to very few 
But if you wear these golden earrings 
Love will come to you
By the burning fire they will glow with every coal 
You will hear desire whisper low in your soul
So be my Gypsy 
Make love your guiding light 
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight
By the burning fire they will glow with every coal 
You will hear desire whisper low in your soul
So be my Gypsy 
Make love your guiding light 
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight 
Let this pair golden earrings cast their spell tonight 
Let this pair golden earrings cast their spell tonight
