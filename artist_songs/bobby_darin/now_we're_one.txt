Now we're one and I love you so
Hold me tight, never let me go
Make the feeling run up my spine
You know I'm yours and you are mine

Now that we are married, baby
We don't have to worry
Now we're one

Now we're one and you're my bride
We don't have to run and hide
Every time I want to hold your hand
To be afraid someone won't understand

Now that we are married, baby
We don't have to worry
Now we're one

Well, I wanna jump to the moon and yell out loud
I feel like I'm walking on an eighteenth cloud
We're gonna put all our fears and cares behind
Ever since we heard the wedding bells chime

Now we're one and I love you so
Hold me tight, never let me go
Make the feeling run up my spine
You know I'm yours and you are mine

Now that we are married, baby
We don't have to worry
Now we're one

I wanna jump to the moon and yell out loud
I feel like I'm walking on an eighteenth cloud
We're put all our fears and cares behind
Ever since we heard the wedding bells chime

Now we're one and you're my bride
We don't have to run and hide
Every time I want to hold your hand
To be afraid someone won't understand

Now that we are married, baby
We don't have to worry
Now we're one

Now we're one, now we're one
Now we're one, now we're one
