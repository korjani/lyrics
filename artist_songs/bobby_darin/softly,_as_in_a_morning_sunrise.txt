Softly as in a mornin' sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day.

Flamin' with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing 
The vow that all betray.

For the passions that thrill love
Lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And lead ya down to hell 
Same old story ...

Softly as in an evenin' sunset
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away. 

For the passions that thrill love
And lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love 
And lead ya into hell
Same old story ...

Softly, softly as in an evenin' sunset, sunset
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away.

"Say Richard ... I don't wanna be a drag or anything,
But the title of this tune is 'Softly' so could we do it that way, please?"
Softly, softly as in an evenin' sunset, sunset
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away.
