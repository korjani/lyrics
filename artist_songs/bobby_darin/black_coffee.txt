I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
In between I drink

Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

Then talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all you do is pour

Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets in coffee and cigarettes

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight

Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
And waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight

Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy, this waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around

Please come around
Please come
