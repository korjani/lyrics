Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

You're looking swell, Dolly
And I can tell, Dolly
You still crowing, you still growing, you still going strong

I feel the room swaying
While the band's playing
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

So, take her rap, fellows
Find her an empty lap, fellows
And Dolly will never go away again

I said hello, Dolly
Well what do yah know, Dolly
It's so nice to have yah back where you belong

You're looking swell, Dolly
And I can tell, Dolly
You're still crowing, you're still growing, you're still going strong

Just feel that room swaying
Cause the band's playing
One of your old familiar songs from way back when

So, golly gee, fellows
Find her an empty knee, fellows
And Dolly will never go away again

I mean hello, Dolly
What do you know, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

I can tell, Dolly
You're looking swell, swell, Dolly
Yeah, you're still crowing, you're still growing, you're still going strong

Just feel that room swaying
While the band keeps on playing
One of your old familiar songs from way back when

So, golly gee, fellows
Have a little faith in me, fellows
And Dolly will never go away again

Just feel that room swaying
While that band is playing
One of your old familiar songs from way back when

So, golly gee, fellows
Find her a vacant knee, fellows
Dolly will never go away
Promise you'll never go away
Dolly will never go away....again

Look out, old Dolly is back!
