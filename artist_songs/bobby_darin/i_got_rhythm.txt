I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man, who could ask for anything more
I got daisies in green pastures
I got my man, who could ask for anything more

Old Man Trouble, I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight, I got sweet dreams
I got my man, who could ask for anything more
Who could ask for anything more

Days can be sunny, with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the tree sing their day full of song
Why shouldn't we sing along
I'm chipper all the day, happy with my lot
How do I get that way, look at what I've got

[Repeat]
