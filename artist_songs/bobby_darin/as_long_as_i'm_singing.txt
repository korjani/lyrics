As long as I'm singin'
There's a bell
Up in my brain that's ringin'
Makin' a crazy ding dong.

And if this band don't desert me
Then there's nothin'
In the world can hurt me
Long as I'm singin' my song.

Give me trumpets ... legato
Put some saxes with 'em
Strings ... pizzicato
Add some rhythm.

As long as I'm singin'
Then the world's all right
And everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singin' my song.

Ummmm... makin' music
Is more to me than a pleasure
'cause me and music
We go together like notes in a measure.

Long as I'm singin'
Then the world's all right
And everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singin' my ...

Long as I'm singin' my ...
Long as I'm singin' my song.
