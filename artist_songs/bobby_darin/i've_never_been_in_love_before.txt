I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you forevermore

I've never been in love before
Kinda thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score

But this is wine
That's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish songs
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

But this is wine
That's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish songs
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before
