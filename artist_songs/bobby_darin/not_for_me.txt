Ballads are being sung 
But not for me 
Church bells are being rung 
But not for me
I am without love 
But I don't doubt love can be 
Warm and tender for some 
But not for me
Poems are being read 
But not for me 
Prayers are being said 
But not for me
I've never known love 
Or been shown love, you see 
And maybe there is such a thing 
But not for me
So let all of your singers sing 
But not for me 
And let all of your church bells ring 
But not for me
And if tomorrow 
All your sorrows should be 
Just like mine then you cry 
But not for me 
No, not me 
Never for me
