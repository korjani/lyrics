Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me.

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine 
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me.

Just one look and then I knew      
That all I longed for long ago was you.

Chills run up and down my spine 
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was never denied me.

One look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you.

That all I longed for long ago...

Aaahhh... just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you.
