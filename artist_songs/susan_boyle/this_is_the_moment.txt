This is the moment; this is the day
When I send all my doubts and demons on their way.
Every endeavor I have made ever
Is coming into play, is here and now today.

This is the moment, this is the time
When the momentum and the moment are in rhyme
Give me this moment, this momentous moment;
I'll gather up my past, and make some sense at last.

This is the moment, when all I've done
All of the dreaming, scheming and screaming becomes one.
This is the day, just see it shine
When all I've lived for becomes mine.

This is the moment, this is the hour
When I can open tomorrow like a flower.
And with my hand to, everything I've planned to
Fulfill my grand design; see all my stars align;

This is the moment, my final test;
Destiny beckoned, I never reckoned second best.
I won't look down, I must not fall;
This is the moment, the sweetest moment of them all.

This is the moment, forget all the odds
This day or never I'll sit forever with the gods.
When I look back I will recall, moment for moment
This was the moment,
The greatest moment of them all.
