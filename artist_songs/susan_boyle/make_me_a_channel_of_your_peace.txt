Make me a channel of your peace.
Where there is hatred let me bring your
Love.
Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord
And where there's doubt, true faith in
You.

[Chorus:]
Oh, Master grant that I may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul.

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there's despair in life, let me bring
Hope
Where there is darkness, only light
And where there's sadness, ever joy.

[Chorus:]

Make me a channel of your peace
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
In giving to all men that we receive
And in dying that we're born to eternal
Life.
