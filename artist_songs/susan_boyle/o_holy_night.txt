O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining, 
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt it's worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, the night when Christ was born; 
O night, O Holy Night, O night divine! 
O night, O Holy Night, O night divine! 

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger; 
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we, 
His power and glory ever more proclaim! 
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
