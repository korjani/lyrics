The Lord is here, the Lord is here.
And I can feel His presence here.
And I don't know what I should do
So I will wait on You.

The Lord is here, the Lord is here.
And I can feel His presence near.
So be still and know that He is God
Just wait... right here.

Oh Lord, teach me how to wait
When there's no words to say.
Even then, give me grace to stay.
Right here, in the secret place.
Where time doesn't matter, eternity waits,
And I will not move 'till I stand face to face
With You... with You.

All I want is You.
[Repeat several times]
