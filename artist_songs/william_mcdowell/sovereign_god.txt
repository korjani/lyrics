[Verse 1:]
Your world is forever
Settled on the Earth
And your plan is for me is perfect and complete

[Bridge:]
I know that I can trust you
I am secure in you

[Chorus:]
So I never have to be afraid
I can trust you God
Trust you sovereign God
No matter what may come my way
I can trust you God
Trust you sovereign God

[Verse 1:]
Your world is forever
Settled on the Earth
And your plan is for me is perfect and complete

I’m in your world
I’m in your hand
I can forever trust your plan
[Repeat]

Sovereign God
Sovereign God
Sovereign God

Forever and Ever I can trust you God.
Forever and Ever I can trust you God.
