[Verse 1:]
We are dry and thirsty
Lord, we need a saturation
A time of refreshing
Let Your Glory rain down
Let it fill us to running over, running over

[Chorus:]
Open up the gates
Flood us with Your rain
Manifest Your Glory Lord
We're thirsty for downpour

[Verse 2:]
We can see the rain clouds
As they gather overhead
We're ready to see them break
Send us living water
Let it fill us to running over, running over

[Vamp:]
Say Yes [x4]
Rain down in this place

And fill us to
Running over [x6]

[Chorus]
