I’m expecting.
Anticipating.
A Move of God.
A Move of God.

[Repeat]

I’m expecting.
Anticipating.
A Move of God.
A Move of God.

We won’t be satisfied 
heaven invades our lives
Move oh God.
Move oh God.

[Bridge:]
And we’ll see
Blind Eyes Opened
Cities and regions changed
I Believe.
We will see a move of God.

[Sopranoes:] A move of God [repeat]
[Altos + Tenors:] We’ve been praying for it. We’ve been longing for it.
We believe we’ll see (A Move of God)

[Everyone:] We’ve been praying for it. We’ve been longing for it.
We believe we’ll see (A Move of God)

Move oh God. Oh Oohhh
Move oh God. Oh Oohhh
Move oh God. Oh Oohhh
Move oh God. Oh Oohhh
A Move of God…
