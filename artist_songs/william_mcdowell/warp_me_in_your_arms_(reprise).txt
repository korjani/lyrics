Wrap me in your arms
William McDowell

There is a God who loves me
Who wraps me in His arms
That is the place where I'm changed
And that's where I belong

Take me to that place Lord
To that secret place where
I can be with you
You can make me like you
Wrap me in your arms
Wrap me in your arms
Wrap me in your arms
