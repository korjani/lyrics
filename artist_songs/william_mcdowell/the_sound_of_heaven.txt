Sound of Heaven

There is a sound,
Sound of hope,
Sound of love,
Drawing all to come,

There is a sound,
Sound of joy,
Sound of peace,
Flowing out of me,

Sound to heal the broken heart,
Comfort for the least of these,
Justice for the lawless
Righteousness and ever flowing stream,
For the fatherless the widows and the orphans,

To hear the sound,
We will release the sound of heaven,

They're crying,
They're seeking,
They're searching,
For the sound of heaven,

They're calling,
They're watching,
They're waiting,
For the sound of heaven,

They're hungry,
They're thirsty,
They're desperate,
For the sound of heaven,

We will release the sound,
We will release the sound,
We will release the sound,
Of heaven.
