Arise... awaken from your sleep
The earth... calls in out in desperate need
Arise, arise, arise... your light has come
(And the glory of the Lord is upon you)
You were created for this time
So arise, the spirit says arise

Arise... this is your destiny
Endow... Christ's authority
Decree, declare and speak in Jesus' name
(And every principality)
Was bowed down
You were created for this time
So arise, the spirit says arise

[Spoken]
The Church we see is not the periphery of the world
But the world on the periphery of the church
Meaning that when God looks at the earth,
When He looks at a city,
He does not see a city with a church in it;
He sees the church with a city around it.

The Church is the vehicle by which Jesus
Speaks, asks and moves;
Everything God wants to do in the earth,
He wants to do through His Church.
Now that you hear his calling and awakening,
What will be your response?

Will you sit back, or will you arise?
Will you stay asleep, or will you take a stand?
I believe that when the Lord speaks,
He waits for His people
To release a sound of response
This is our response:

[Choir sings, worship leader ad lib.]
We will arise... We will arise...
Lord, we are not ashamed to proclaim Your name
Jesus... [3x]

We will arise... We will arise...
Lord, we are not ashamed to proclaim Your name
Jesus... [11x] We will arise!
