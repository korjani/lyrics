Hey Everybody It's Music Time

"Now, you can't expect to figure out how to be cool looking in catalogs, so forget about it"
"You've gotta do it the old-fashioned way...fake it!"
Yeah!
"Play your drum boy!"

I like music
The rhythm really gets to me
I can't control it
My feet move automatically
And I like hot licks
The kind I wish that I could play
And when I hear them
I crank the volume all the way

Turn it on
Turn it up
Turn it loud
All the way

I like strangers
Their kindness means a lot to me
They don't ask questions
Don't care about my history
And I like fast girls
I don't know what's come over me
They make me do things
I would not ordinarily

Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
All the way

Hear it
Feel it
Like it
Do it do it do it do it

Want it
Need it
Love it
Can't get enough of it

Try it
Do it
Go ahead and go for it
All the way......

And I like daydreams
I've had enough reality
My job is boring
I'm overworked and underpaid
I like TV
It stirs up all my fantasies
Girls in tight jeans
Acting so outrageously

Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
All the way

Hear it
Feel it
Like it
Do it do it do it do it

Want it
Need it
Love it
Can't get enough of it

Try it
Do it
Go ahead and go for it
All the way
Turn me loose, loose!

Oh!
I like big things
The size of them impresses me
Just give me plenty
Forget about the quality
And I like fast food
The burgers always taste the same
No snotty waiters,
Escargot or Beaujolais

Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
Turn it loud
All the way

I hear it
I feel it
I like it
I do it do it do it do it

I want it
I need it
I love it
I can't get enough of it

I hear it
I feel it
I like it
I do it do it do it do it

Try it
Do it
Go ahead and bank on it
All the way
Way-ay-ay

Yeah!
Turn it on
Turn it up
Turn it loose
