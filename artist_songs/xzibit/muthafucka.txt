I Know You Schemin
Have You Leavin'
Screamin' "Fuck You, Pay Me!"
LA Got Tons Of Dameies,
Thats Quick To Have That Baby
And That Try To Squeeze You
For Every Penny That You Thought Of Makin'

These Streets Is Fuckin' Viscious
Can't Make The Wrong Decisions
They Have You Shot Up
And Shot Up, Caught Up Behind Some Bitches
Handle Your Business Homie
Cause Ain't No Homies In Business
So Many People In This Business

I See Right Through Them Traps
These Niggaz Run Their Yaps
But When It Really Cracked

My Paper Come In Stacks
And Stacks Of Rubberbands
Thicker Than A Paperback

Just Let The Henny Flow

Ready Set Baby Here We Go
Its Not A Fuckin Game,
You Know my Fuckin Name
I'm Number One,
With A Motherfuckin Bullet MAN!

[Chorus]
You Know It Could Happen
It Don't Happen Till It Happen
When It Happen
You Gonna Wish It Never Did
MOTHAFUCKA!
