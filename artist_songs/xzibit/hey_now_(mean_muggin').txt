[Verse 1]
I'm a menace, to society baby
the police want to relocate me
they run up with gun up, but they can't faze me
they wanted to come up, but they ain't crazy got
I ride one in the chain with gun on top
Six train Chevrolet rolln' without no top
got them hydraulics is dumpin and make it drop
California to Virginia, Timmy makin it hot
takin long rides in a G4 plane
X-Man to the stage got em goin insane
Yeah nigga got the world sayin my name
I'm bout to make a little change, I'm a keep it the same
X to the Z baby, run up on ya, hittin corners
Phantom platinum grill
X be the life of the party, 
don't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody

[Chorus]
Can you feel the speakers jumpin
other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin
feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now
All the girls mean muggin
cuz they musta seen what a girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do somthin
feelin kinda rowdy, huh?
Hey Now, Hey Now

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, look where I live
40 acres and a Maybach Benz
you wanted to party, but I got biz
this ain't entertainin, I'm feedin my kids
On a 4-oh-5 in the car pool lane
Got to hit some corners, I'm ridin the cane
Wanna ride out to a island, and tan your frame
and just waste away a couple of days,
Holla back at me!
Look where I rap, make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat
LA on my baseball hat, where they wanna ride up on you in that black on black
Move, betta, bounce like a mother 
when brother got mass weapons of war with each other
X getting big, not ready to die yet, my militant mindset
got you runnin for cover

[Chorus]

[Hook]
I'm the life of the party, 
I got a moon roof, we poppin up out of
Look at the whole world they talkin about us
I got a mean hook, to rattle ya body

[Verse 3]
I wanna talk a little, pick ya brain
wanna see you in somethin little, walk around the plane
I got a lot to gain, getting my record off the ground
like David Blaine
So now, what you know bout me?, I'm a self-made man from poverty
Now I own a lot of property
I pimp rides, lifestyles, and companies
Now let me spit you the facts
I used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringin you that
I'm like swingin a bat, run at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that
baby girl touchin my chain, now let me tell you who I ain't
Bitch you can't run no games, (A gangsta baby, ain't nothing changed)

[Chorus]
