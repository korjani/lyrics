I shouldn't say it, but I'm starting to think I care
I've had a drink, you probably think my judgement is impaired
And it's getting late now, we're a long way from our homes
Before you leave, before you grieve, there's one thing you should know

When you hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, yeah I can feel your heart
When you hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, yeah I can feel your heart beating

Suddenly I'm standing on a treetop up so high
And all the songs, and all the poems, suddenly they're right
And I'm dumbfounded by the breadth of your self control
But I don't care 'cause you're here, and you and I both know

When you hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, yeah I'm picking out the stars
When you hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, yeah I can feel your heart beating

Oh when you hold me, hold me in your arms
Hold me, I can feel your heart
Hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Hold me, yeah I can feel your heart

When you hold me, hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, I can feel your heart
Oh when you hold me, when you hold me in your arms
Oh when you hold me, yeah I can feel your heart beating
