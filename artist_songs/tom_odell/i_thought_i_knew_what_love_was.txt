I thought it was easy
I thought you could choose
I thought that if you tried hard
Then you couldn't lose
I thought it was pleasure
I thought it was pure

Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till I met you
Oh I thought I thought I knew what love was
'till I met you

It's more like a storm
No, you wanted some more
Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till I felt yours

Thought it was simple
Thought we on track
I thought if you kept on giving
Then you'd get it back
I thought it was spoiled
But I guess I was wrong

Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till you were gone
Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till you were gone

It's sweet and it's stone cold
And it's cruler than cruel
It's long and it's harder
And it don't got no rules

Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till I met you
Oh I thought I knew what love was
'till I met you
