Take my mind and take my pain,
Like an empty bottle takes the rain.

And heal, heal, heal, heal.

And take my past and take my sins,
Like an empty sail takes the wind.

And heal, heal, heal, heal.

And tell me some things last.
And tell me some things last.

Take my heart and take my hand,
Like an ocean takes the dirty sands.
And heal, heal, hell heal!

Take my mind and take my pain,
Like an empty bottle takes the rain.
And heal, heal, hell heal!

And tell me some things last.
And tell me some things last.
And tell me some things last.
And tell me some things last.
