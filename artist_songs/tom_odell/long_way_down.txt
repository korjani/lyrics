Walking on the rooftops
Talking of times
With our eyes a glowing
Like the city lights
She stands on the ledge,
She says, 'it looks so high'

You know it's a...

Long way down
Feels like a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave,
Please don't leave me now

Cuz I can feel the rivers
Winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet
Like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand

But you know..

It's a long way down
You know it's a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Love it feels like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave,
Please don't leave me now
