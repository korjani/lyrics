I keep waking at night in the freezing cold
Staring at the shadows coming up the walls
Giving me a feeling I can't define
Is there anyone there I say to the dark
But all I get back is a beating heart
Going out of rhythm, and I realize

Oooh something's changed
Oooh something's changed

It's just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
Just a mind trick
I don't know why but it reminds me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget
It's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me I should have never let you go

Look up there don't you see her face
That familiar heart that familiar shape
Giving me a feeling I can't define

Oooh something's changed
Oooh something's changed

It's just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
Just a mind trick
I don't know why but it reminds me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget
It's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me I should have never let you go

I wanna throw my arms around you
Tell everyone I've found you
But you're just a shadow in my mind
You know you got me so enchanted
Why you gotta be cold hearted
Dancing on your own in that cold street light

You're just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
Just a mind trick
I don't know why but you remind me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget
It's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me I should have never let you go
