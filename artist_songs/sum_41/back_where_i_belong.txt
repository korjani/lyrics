Got my back against the wall
Try to scream - there's no sound at all
I'm stuck with nowhere to turn but I'm trying
Trying hard not to be the one
Left behind to become undone
You can't stop what's already begun
Here in the down and out

I'm not giving up
I won't let go
Cause I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough
I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong

A step closer but so far away
It seems like it's further everyday
The feelings never go away but I'm trying
At the end of a losing race
Time passes me without a trace
Trying hard just to find a place
Now that I'm on to you

I'm not giving up
I won't let go
Cause I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough
I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong

Memories, they hold a place
Just in time to go to waste
And they all become replaced

I'm not giving up
I won't let go
Cause I am back where I belong

I'm not giving up
I won't let go
Cause I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough
I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong
