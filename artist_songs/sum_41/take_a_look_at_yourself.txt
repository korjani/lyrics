Messengers always told me that I had to have a plan
But their visions off and they don't understand

The little Hitler's of the forgotten love
They'll shoot you right in your face and watch you spill your blood
And you tell me that I'm the one who needs to have a plan

Tie me to the road, and watch my hands bleed
Pin me to a cross, and crucify me
Drag me through the dirt, of guilt and envy
Open up your eyes, and you will see

You're not a saviour or a saint,
Well then,
Who are you to me?

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

Mother why do you believe it will always be ok?
Another wishful dream that you believe

And what we have here, is people selling fear
It's a joke by now, we've become not clear
And you tell me that I'm the one who needs to have a plan

Television plays, effected my mind
Channels all the same, or am I blind?
Imagination is, it's just a figment
Of reality, when will you see?

You're not a saviour or a saint,
Well then,
Who are you to me?

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

-rock ooooout with your cock out-

Take a look at yourself

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just,
Look inside the mirror and
Tell me what you see

(Take a look at yourself)

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help just

I can't help you,
You don't stand a chance to make it
If you really want help
