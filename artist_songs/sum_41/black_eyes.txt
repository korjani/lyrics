I never wanted to be
Another one in the same
I may never fit in
But I will always remain
If only you could read my mind
If only just for one more time

You say there's no where to run
But I got nothin' to hide
I can see through the shit
Even through these black eyes
A confession of a dangerous mind
A direction to perfection is the last thing I want

So tell me when does enough ever become enough
If everything is to lose, and I will never give up
I don't care what you've got in mind
The truth is never hard to find
I've been trying to break the only link in the chain
I've been pleading the 5th, cause I got nothin' to say
A bad plan with no warning signs
A god given region with the passion I don't want

Cause this I say to you
I'm bleeding out of my heart
Tell me if it's true
This is tearing me apart
So tell me one more time
Cause I can't let you go
If this is where it lies, tell me
Cause I just need to know

The truth is all I needed to know
Do you 
Still feel 
The same way
Still

Cause this I say to you
I'm bleeding out of my heart
Tell me if it's true
This is tearing me apart
So tell me one more time
Cause I can't let you go
If this is where it lies, tell me
Cause I just need to know
