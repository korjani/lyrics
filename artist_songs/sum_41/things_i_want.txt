So many christmas letters,
So many wishes,
Lucy wants a squeezie doll,
Jimmy wants a moon rocket,
Oh, this list is rather long,

Yeah!

Hey now Santa I'm writing to you,
Cos there's a lot of cool shit I want
I know I've been naughty but cut me some slack,
Cos there's a lot of cool shit I want,
So here's my list-a, 
So check it out twice-a,
I want,
A solid gold Harley with machine guns on the front,
I want,
A Motley Crew lunchbox filled with sticky buns,

I want a see through jumpsuit that fits me tight,
I want all of the Beatles copyrights,
I want to chop Florida off the map,
I want Pamela Anderson's speedo top,

So there you go Santa theres my christmas list,
Thats all the cool shit I want,
But wait a minute Santa theres some things I missed,
There's still a lot of cool shit I want,
So here's my list-a,
So check it out twice-a,
I want,
A time machine and a BB gun,
I want,
A statue of Moby on the surface of the sun,
I want,
To party naked on a schoolbus full of nuns,
I want,
A bumper pool table and a robot pelican,

There you go Santa I'm sure you'll agree,
That there's some really cool shit I want,
I know I've been naughty but I guarantee,
That I deserve every single one,

So here's my list-a,
So check it out twice-a,
I know I've been naughty but life ain't nice-a,
PS I still-a need some more shit-a,

A diamond hyena shooting fire from his butt,

A cannibal chef to cook me sweet and sour buns,

A magical sleigh thats pulled by flying skunks,

All the cool shit I want!
