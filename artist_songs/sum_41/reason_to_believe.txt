I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists

I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists

Yeah, give me reason to believe
This world's not a sick machine,
When everywhere's a dead end in every direction
Yeah, can you give me what I need
Or just sit and watch me bleed?
'Cause after all, you can't get everything you want now
But all I would need is one thing to keep me moving on

Everybody's got a secret, can you tell me what is mine?
Can you tell me what you'd find, I'll tell you if you keep it
I promise not to lie, oooh

Well, I have the fears, the pain and the tears I just can't hide
It all disappears 'cause everything passes with the time
All you need is reason to believe
