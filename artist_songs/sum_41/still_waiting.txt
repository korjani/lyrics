[Chorus:]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation

These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's time too late....

[Chorus:]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding

How far
Will we take this
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's time too late

[Chorus]

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless, tell me so

What have we done
with a war that can't be won
This can't be real
Cause I don't know what to feel

[Chorus:]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
For this world to BELIEVE
