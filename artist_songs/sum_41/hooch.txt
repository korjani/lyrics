It's your last chance to find yourself in consequence.
It's so hard to find a simple reason.
Maybe I'll find myself with evidence.
Hate breeds with nothing believe in.

Another day another day in paradise.
If you only knew wouldn't it be nice.
Get away get away get away.
I'm about to detonate.

Everything to prove 
Nothing to lose
Just when everything has fallen to the ground
Gonna knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you it's alright.

This time we're on our way to tragedy
Forever bored and outside from the in crowd.
I've come to grip confronting my reality.
Numbstruck it's me against the world now.

For all you know for all you know it's not for real
Spare me the obsession that you deal.

Get away get away get away.
I'm about to detonate.

Everything to prove
Nothing to lose
Just when everything has fall to the ground
Gonna knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you it's alright.

I should've know right from the start
That you'd take this trust and rip me apart.
Could be a change of heart.

I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real.

I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real.

I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real.
