I've said this before no matter how hard I try.
I can't help be bored while this world passes by.

SO!

This revelation's got no meaning.
We've lost it all in hopeless dreaming.

AM I JUST LOSING GRIP??
Paint it black and just forget me.
THIS WORLD'S A SINKING SHIP!
'Cause our baggage is too heavy

I can't stop believing that there's something to be said.
What are we achieving with the bull shit that we're fed?
I know I'm not gonna stay, or live to see the day, 
this world comes to be, here's a resignation from me.
A resignation from me.
A resignation from me.

I've said this before no matter how hard I try.
I can't help be bored while this world passes by.

Don't tell me we're close to something, that we don't even understand.

WE'RE PRISONERS TO OUR HOMES!!
Some might say we're all to blame.
THE OUTSIDE'S SO UNKNOWN!!!
I don't want you to complain.

I can't find the answers to save humanity.
I can't fight the anger.
Here's a resignation from me.
A resignation from me.
A resignation from me.
A resignation from me.
A resignation from me.
