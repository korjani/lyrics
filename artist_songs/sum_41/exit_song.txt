There's nothing left to say
Cause you don't want to try
And I don't want the pain

There's nothing left to do
Well I don't want the lies
And you don't feel the same

It's time to let you go
And bow out of the game
And maybe we will find
The answers through the blame

It's time for me to go
It's time for me to go, oh
