Last call for regrets and defeat
To finish the bottle full of empty dreams
Punch-drunk headed straight out of line
Another excuse with no alibi
Hitching on the road of decline
With no-name streets and no vital signs
I pissed away the best of me and 
No one can help me

{I'm} misery's best friend dead beat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit don't forget that you better
Count your last blessings
I fell off the wagon 
I'm chasing six feet
and now I'm running out of time

My hands are tied and nailed to the cross
I'm looking for all the composure I lost
I'm petulant with a bad attitude
A poster child vision of wasted youth
I dodged the book and found the key
I can't stay the same for dignity
I pissed away the best of me and
No one can help me

{I'm} misery's best friend dead beat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit don't forget that you better
Count your last blessings
I fell off the wagon 
I'm chasing six feet
and now I'm running out of time

Now I'm my own enemy
I don't hear you now
Perfect Tragedy
God bless us denial
