Where do I begin, 'cause my story's still untold
Left to be unwritten, like memories to unfold
And I don't believe the truth, it doesn't make me feel alive
The truth's just overrated, we've all got something to hide

Cause lies make it so much fun
So sing the praise of insincerity
Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

Pay me no more mind, have I really come undone?
I left the world this evening, just to kill the sun
And I've got no more to bleed, all that's left will soon be gone
And especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn

Well I bet you got a lot to say
So have it your way and crucify me
Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

Breathless kiss to end all this
I fall, I say goodbye to all
Close my eyes, a sweet demise
A love that no one understands

And I don't believe in redemption
And no one will be spared
There's 32 ways you can die here tonight
It's a fucking family affair

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head
