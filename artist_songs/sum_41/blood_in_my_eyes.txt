I don't believe in the secrets you keep
But I do wanna know
How do you sleep at night

And I'm over you, congratulations
Thank you for all the pain
Cause it made it be so much more fun

There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (they're dead)
And I don't believe theres a way now
All that is said has been said (been said)
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes

Seen through the lines, while believing the lies
For too long a time
And I still don't know how I did

And now war's declared, drawing the battle lines
And I can't see straight anymore
With all of this blood in my eyes
