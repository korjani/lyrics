Was happiness a fad?
Or was it in the lost and found again behind the issues.
It might not be so bad,
We're all addicted to our tragedy,
I guess it's what it had to be.

With nothing on my back,
It's still enough to bring me down.
My mind's about to crack, 
Cause what I thought could not be found.
Matter of in fact,
It's harder still when you're around.
With nothing on my back,
I can't help but drown. 

I might as well belong to both of you.
And the mess you always seem to drag me through.
That night forever always haunting me.
But I guess it is what it's supposed to be,
But spare your thoughts of sympathy.

With nothing on my back,
It's still enough to bring me down.
My mind's about to crack,
