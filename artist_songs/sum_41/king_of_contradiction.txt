I've dethroned the king of contradiction
or were you just a jester all along a simple pawn
Don't you know you can't count 
your tears like your money
Running down like rain in the drain

You don't need to pray for me'cause I'm not the
one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
How could it be know not what we've became
you lost the human race

I hope you burn like a cigarette in ashes
as your head comes down and crashes
your throat pours blood from slashes
and I hope you never forget like a tattoo of regret
this time, this time

You don't need to pray for me cause I'm not the
one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
how could it be know not what we've became
you lost the human race

You're replaced now
was nice to know you
now your time is up so
just drop dead
