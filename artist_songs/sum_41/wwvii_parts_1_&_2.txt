The year is 3468 
And they're about to eliminate 
Life as we all know it on Planet Earth 
They're products of a new regime 
With manufactured designer genes 
Scientifically enhanced at birth 

Superior in almost every way 
With telepathic DNA 
They'll hunt you down there's nowhere you can hide 
Created for the killing machine 
Proto-nuclear human beings 
We must help to prevent this genocide 

Have we created, our own demise 
Their out to kill, using their minds 
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up 

It seems the time has come for the human race 
Gone for good, vanishing without a trace 
Cerebroids are silencing their cries 
The clones are trying to assist evolution 
Through state sponsored executions 
Will nothing stop this evil enterprise? 

Until the day a leader emerges 
With mind powers like electric surges 
He'll give us hope, he'll teach us how to fight 
A clash of arms with the enemy 
And outcome no can forsee 
Let's pray they can't withstand our human right 

Have we created, our own demise 
Their out to kill, using their minds 
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up 

Have we created, our own demise 
Their out to kill, using their minds 
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up
