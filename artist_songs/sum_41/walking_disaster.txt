I haven't been home for a while, 
I'm sure everything's the same:
Mom and Dad both in denial, 
an only child to take the blame.
Sorry Mom but I don't miss you, 
Father's no name you deserve.
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, 
wouldn't come home for the world.

{You'll} never know what I've become, 
the king of all that's said and done.
The forgotten son?
This city's buried in defeat, 
I walk along these no name streets,
Wave goodbye to all, 
as I fall...

At the dead end I begin 
to burn the bridge of innocence.
Satisfaction guaranteed, 
a pill away catastrophe.
On a mission, nowhere bound, 
inhibitions underground,
A shallow grave I 
have dug all by myself.

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong.
All innocence is long gone.
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong.

A walking disaster, 
the son of all bastards.
You regret you made me, 
it's too late to save me.
(You regret you made me, 
it's too late to save me.)

(And he said)
Far as I can tell, 
it's just voices in my head.
Am I talking to myself? 
'Cause I don't know what I just said. 

(And she said)
Far is where I fell, 
maybe I'm better off dead.
Am I at the end of nowhere? 
Is this as good as it gets?

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong.
All innocence is long gone.
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong.

A walking disaster, 
the son of all bastards.
You regret you made me, 
it's too late to save me.
(To save me, to save me, to save me...)

I will be home in a while, 
you don't have to say a word.
I can't wait to see you smile, 
wouldn't miss it for the world.
