Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

I'm getting sick of hypocrites saying nothing
Got a feeling that I don't belong
And you seem to feel like it's alright

Take your pick, dirty tricks, say you're bluffing
Takes a lifetime just to right the wrong
And I've never felt this, so alive

You're all dead to me

Gotta say it was nice to know you all
Take a look cause the writing's on the wall
You disappear but I survive

Don't believe that it's only black and white
It's written in all the diamonds of the night
And I've never felt this, so alive

You're all dead to me (dead to me)
You're all dead to me (dead to me)
You're all dead to me (dead to me)
