I don't know what you want and I don't wanna know
I got you where I want and I won't let go
So get your kicks out quick while you still got time
That's fine

I know just what you've done, I need no alibis
I hope you've had your fun, you sure know how to live
Cause your just a drag and you just ran out of time
Well that's quite alright, well

Well do what you want, but don't be proud
Cause baby you don't wanna know
What I'm gonna do when you're not around
No baby you don't wanna know

I got you right where I want
And I bet you gonna set you off
And I tell you anything you want
But baby you don't wanna know
Baby you don't wanna know, hey

It beats me black and blue but I can't resist
I'm dragging myself through this kind of masochist
But I'll be fine like this till the end of time
That's quite alright

Well do what you want, but don't be proud
Cause baby you don't wanna know
What I'm gonna do when you're not around
No baby you don't wanna know

I got you right where I want
And I bet you gonna set you off
And I tell you anything you want
But baby you don't wanna know
Baby you don't wanna know

Baby you don't wanna know
Baby you don't wanna know

It's alright
I don't mind
Cause you just might be outta time

Well do what you want, but don't be proud
Cause baby you don't wanna know
What I'm gonna do when you're not around
No baby you don't wanna know

I got you right where I want
And I bet you gonna set you off
And I tell you anything you want
But baby you don't wanna know
Baby you don't wanna know

Baby you don't wanna know
Baby you don't wanna know
No no baby you don't wanna know
