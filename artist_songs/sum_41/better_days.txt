It's something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time
It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine
You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing alright
I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight.

You know that you had to know that I'd be on my way
It happened long ago there's nothing more to say
And I don't wanna be the one to tell you blood is on your hands
And I don't think you realize or even understand so I say

Days go by some good and some are bad
Soon you'll realize it all goes by so fast and its over

Its something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time
It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine
You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing alright
I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight.
