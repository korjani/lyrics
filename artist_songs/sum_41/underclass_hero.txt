Well I
Won't be caught living in a dead-end job,
While praying to my government, guns and God.
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment.

And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing),
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy).
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless).
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me).

Well because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control.
And we don't need anything from you,
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you.

(A call across the Underclass.)
Calling out loud with no respect,
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject.
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend.
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against.

Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere),
Burning the flag (of the degeneration).
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future).
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening).

Well because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control.
And we don't need anything from you,
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you.

May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass,
As your hero at large!

One, two, three, four...

We're the saints of degeneration,
We don't owe anyone an explanation.
Fuck elitists, we don't need this,
We're the elite of just alright.
