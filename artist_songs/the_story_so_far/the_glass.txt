Lead you so far down
I could tell you'd never been
Told me that time's near
And how it will change everything
I'm not so open like the window you are
The glass just reflects the scar

Told me that you had to leave
But how the fuck does that change anything?

Your glare is the faintest
No brightness to show
I made the best of what I thought was impossible
You were the spade I used to dig this hole
Blistered my skin to the bone

Swear all the pain's done
No trace or tremor here
Or am I still numb? Have I been this whole year?
So let me bite down, feel the clench in my teeth
Till I come around then relapse and repeat
Then relapse and repeat

Your glare is the faintest
No brightness to show
I made the best of what I thought was impossible
You were the spade I used to dig this hole
Blistered my skin to the bone

Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Now you're...
