You can't sell me incense
My world smells good enough to eat
So let's not eat, just smell the good in longing
Not owning

We'll circle like insects
Incensing the grief-liquored herd
Have you heard an encouraging word from them?
They pretend

To be so above it all
Or so they would have you think
I think no one thinks at all

You might show some interest
Your world looks good enough to eat
I see the ghost of a better world
Living in your disbelief in ghosts

Everyone tells me they're crazy
Crazy people aren't so fucking boring
Wake me when you're through being cool, cause I'm snoring
And hoping

To see you beside yourself
Show me the raw stuff of youth
Would you do it for yourself?

Or for me, we both need a change
Your fear of normalcy is hardly strange
Let's be freaks, plain-clothes police
Let's be deliberate, because it's obvious to me

Deliberately weird is pretty obvious
So color me obvious
I just want to be happy half the time
And blue only when I have the time
