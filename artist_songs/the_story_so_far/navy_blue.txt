I bet it hurts to read permanence. 
I used to think on all of this and how you don't. 
Damn it's hard to find sustenance when all I had was love for this and now you don't. 
Now I just abuse substances to drown out your accomplishments, however few. 

All of this frustrates me bad cause I can't stay mad at you or change anything that I had. 
She told me don't think like that, it's really not that bad. 
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad.

If it's something serious then hit me up but until then the door is shut, forget my room.
And if I had a match for every lie and every attempt to deny, I'd strike a few. 
I am the walls, the silent halls. My jacket at your sisters wedding, navy blue. 

All of this frustrates me bad cause I can't stay mad at you or change anything that I had. 
She told me don't think like that, it's really not that bad. 
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad.
