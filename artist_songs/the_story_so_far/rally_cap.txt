I should have told you, when we were younger,
Talk quenches thirst but does nothing for hunger
And I'm starving, it's been like this for three years now.
They tell me take it easy but I don't know how.

I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore. [x2]

I don't have any place to stay but I wouldn't advise the risk.
You leave me in the deep end with ankles made of bricks,
But I'm used to dealing with crooks and pricks,
They fill the minutes while the clock ticks.

I don't have any place to stay but I wouldn't advise the risk.
I've got nothing in common,
You leave me in the deep end with ankles made of bricks, with anything, anymore,
But I'm used to dealing with crooks and pricks,
They fill up the minutes while the clock, it ticks.
I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore.

Talk quenches thirst but does nothing for hunger
And I'm starving, it's been like this for three years now.

Self medicate cause I'm sick. I've got nothing in common,
Of cutting ties much to thick. With anything, anymore.
Please make this painless and quick. [x2]
