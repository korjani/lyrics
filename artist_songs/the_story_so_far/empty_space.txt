All that I know
Is your space is empty
It’s buried below
The stress and the envy
All the places I go
It still hasn’t left me
I hated it then
And now it consumes me

I dwell on it nightly
Tread swiftly and lightly
Make up the lost ground
And see what you don’t see
All questions aside
I asked and you lied
And now my hands are tied

All I can show
Is absence from your life
That I can’t control
It’s all that I get right
Keep paying the toll
I know that it seems like
I’m always upset
I know it seems like I'm always upset

(I know it seems like I'm always upset)

All that I know
Is your space is empty
It’s buried below
It still hasn’t left me
All that I know
Is your space is empty
It’s buried below
It still hasn’t left

I dwell on it nightly
Tread swiftly and lightly
Make up the lost ground
And see what you don’t see
All questions aside
I asked and you lied
And now my hands are tied

I dwell on it nightly
Tread swiftly and lightly
Make up the lost ground
And see what you don’t see
All questions aside
I asked and you lied
And now my hands are tied
