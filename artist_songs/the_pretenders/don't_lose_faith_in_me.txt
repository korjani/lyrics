Don't lose faith in me
Don't lose faith in me
If you lose faith in me
You lose faith in us

Don't lose harmony
Don't lose harmony
If you lose harmony
You won't need me

Look at me
Can you see how I'm trying
Only you can see me crying
Look at me
These tears ain't lying

One pays the butcher
One pays the thief
I'm looking for you darling
Show me some relief
Artist on the cover
Is a phony and a crook
I'm looking for you lover
Show me where to look

Don't lose faith in me
Please don't lose faith in me
If you lose faith
You lose faith in us
