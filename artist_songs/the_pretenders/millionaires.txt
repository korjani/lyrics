They're just millionaires
They got the money, but who cares?
They'll never be like you and me
Cause money can't buy poverty
They think they govern our affairs
- They're just millionaires!

When they pass us in their cars
They look at us like we're from Mars
Those distant eyes look sympathetic
We slash their tyres cause we're pathetic
And we get paid for the repairs
By the millionaires!

They're just millionaires
They got the money
They got the money yeah!
They're just millionaires
They got the money child
They got the money yeah!
They're just millionaires
They got the money child
They got the money child yeah!

If they'd just leave us in their will
We'd all be dressed to kill
- And burn our polyester flares
With the millionaires!
