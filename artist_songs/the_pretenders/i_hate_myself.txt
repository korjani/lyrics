I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
For being jealous
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
For thing that you can't see

I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
For using other fellows
To blindside you to get inside of me

Believe me I'm not saying that I'm proud
To undermine and sabotage your scene
I wouldn't want to say some things out loud
But everybody does it and you know what I mean

I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
For backing the wrong horse
I hate myself, I hate myself
I hate my masquerade of black and blue

I hate myself, I hate my reckless 
And self-destruction course
And coming last conceding second best to you

And if on judgement day I'm told to make my way
To take a blasting residence downstairs
I look to see your fathers, who backstab their own brothers
Got a lighter sentence showing mercy and repentance

I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
I guess I'm just too smart
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
In body and in mind

I hate myself, I hate myself
I hate these perversions of the heart
I hate myself up front
I hate myself from behind

So take my hand
To the witness stand
I deserve the worst
My heart is gonna burst
So validate me hate me where it hurts

I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself

I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself
I hope that you do too

I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself
But most of all I hate myself
Hating you
