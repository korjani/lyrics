The mid-twenty joys, around a heart that's black and blue
The tattooed love boys, I tore my knees up getting to you
Cause I needed to find out what the thing was for been reading
But man the time came to explore

I went ape wire, cause I thought
Like I'd like it, little tease, but I didn't mean it
But you mess with the goods doll
Honey you gotta pay

A good time was guaranteed for one and all
The tattoos did target practice in the hall
While waiting for their number to get called out
I, I, I, I found out what the wait was about

I was a good time, yeah, I got pretty good
At changing tyres, upstairs bro
I shot my mouth off
And you showed me what that hole was for

Now I see you all impressed and half undressed
You got paint stick all over the scars and lumps and bumps
Tattooed love boys have got you where I used to lay
Well ha ha and too bad, but you know what they say

Stop snivellin'
You're gonna make some plastic surgeon a rich man
Oh, but the prestige and the glory
Another human interest story, you are that
