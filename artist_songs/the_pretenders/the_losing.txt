If it's games you want I've played a few
Let me say up front I'll lose to you
I can see you're a beginner
Well beginner's luck runs out
You think you're a winner
But let me tell ya
The winning's not what it's all about
You see, it's about the losing
Can't rest until I'm losing

At first you feel hungry
Then you're thirsty too
Then a desperate feeling comes over you
You think you can beat
What no one has before
Then you start to cheat
Before you know it
You're back for more

You see it's about the losing
Can't stop when I'm at the top
It's about the losing
Every time I win I have to start again
Can't rest, rest until I'm losing
A bluff's about as good as the getting will get
You see in this neighborhood
We're all in debt

A little more money
A little more fame
Who amongst us, if anybody
Wouldn't risk it all
To stay in the game
You see it's about the losing
Can't stop when I'm at the top
It's about the losing
Every time I win I have to start again

Can't rest, rest until I'm losing
Can't rest, rest until I'm losing
Can't rest, rest until I'm losing
It's about the losing
It's about the losing
It's about the losing
