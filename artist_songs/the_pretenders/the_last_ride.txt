I made my bed but I couldn't sleep in it
With the man in red tracking me minute by minute
Running like a horse
Always looking behind me
But of course he would always find me

[Chorus:]
Hey buddy
Hey friend
My pal
My brother
We take shelter in each other
I'll keep it simple
You keep it true
I owe my last ride to you

Heaven and hell ride in tandem
I used to mix them up at random
I spent my youth on a reckless futile race
Where love and truth could never place

[Chorus]

After all, nobody can save
The mortal body from the grave
Who can arrest the soul's sad journey in its plight?
- one more day to get it right

I decided to stop dying
No more cheatin' no more lyin'
What kind of club opens its gates to sinners like me?
And bids them forth unto eternity

[Chorus]

Under the buckeye trees
Where the rubber city grew
I owe the last ride to you
