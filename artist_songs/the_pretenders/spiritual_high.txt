Sounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And I will bring you to my heart

Love like a signal you call
Touching my body my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here

Home be the temple of your heart
Home be the body of your love
Just like Holy water to my lips

Yes I do know how I survive
Yes I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day by day by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all-in his wisdom-hear
His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This State of independence shall be
This State of independence shall be

(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)
(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)

Love like a signal you call
Touching my body my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here
Home be the temple of your heart
Home be the body of your love
Just like Holy water to my lips

Hey

Yes I do know how I survive
Yes I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day by day by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all-in his wisdom-hear
His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This State of independence shall be
This State of independence shall be

(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)
(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)
(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)
(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)

This State of independence shall be

His truth will abound the land

(Hey, hey Yayah yaya oh)
