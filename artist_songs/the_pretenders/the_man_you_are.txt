I don't expect flowers
I don't expect rings
I don't expect promises
A sentimental thing

I just expect you
To be the man you are
I just expect you
To be the man you are

I don't expect sobriety
I don't expect stealth
I don't expect you'll ever be a man
Defined by your wealth

I just expect you
To be the man you are
I just expect you
To be the man you are

When a woman loves a man
She'll do anything he asks
She'll do anything she can
When a woman loves a man

I don't expect accolades
I don't expect prizes
I don't expect you'll ever see a babe
In different guises

I just expect you
To be the man you are
I just expect you
To be the man you are
To be the man you are
Be the man you are
Be the man you are
Be the man you are
Be the man you are
