[Intro:]
Cruising down Melrose
Just me and a bad bitch

[Hook:]
I'm just cruising down Melrose
Chilling with a bad bitch
It's summertime, we got the top down
Her hair blowing in the wind
I'm just crusing down [?]
Chilling with a bad bitch
From Bell Harbor to Rodeo
Me and my bitch straight flexing

[Verse 1:]
I'm just riding down Rodeo
My bitch do what I say so
I spent a ten off in that Louis store
Everything I say for sure
My bitch she from Mexico
We be balling with the extra dough
We buying cars with the extra grams
Thank God for spook hands
My bitch off in that MIAO
All we talk is yayo
I spent like 80 racks today though
And blew 100 racks a day ago

[Hook:]
I'm just cruising down Melrose
Chilling with a bad bitch
It's summertime, we got the top down
Her hair blowing in the wind
I'm just crusing down [?]
Chilling with a bad bitch
From Bell Harbor to Rodeo
Me and my bitch straight flexing

[Verse 2:]
[?] purse, she got that
Hermes shit she got that
In Sak's we gone fuck up racks
Tomorrow I juug that right back
My bitch she keep it 100
She ain't worried bout my motherfucking money
Cause me and her together get money
So around the world we stunting
I'm riding down Peach street
Got [?] and Scooter behind me
They don't trust me with no bitch
They know I be tripping

Red bottoms, diamond watch chain and earrings

Her hair blowing in the wind
