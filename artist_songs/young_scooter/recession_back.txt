Stingy niggas scraping up the crumbs and recook em

Broad daylight we be serving while these neighbours looking
Playing with this white, that dog food that never shook em
I got bills and all my bitches creamed
Still false and I can't tell you what none of these numbers mean
Bitch I'm pissing dirty I won't put this cup down, pour it
Just woke up early, waiting for them bricks to touch down
I just bought another trap in case this one get shut down
Shit getting outta hand we serving out the back and front now
I'm pulling up a chopper with them guapo
I fuck with them blacks but I still sell rocks though
