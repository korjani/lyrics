[Hook:]
Niggas got so many flaws
So having friends is irrelevant
The real [?]
You other niggas is irrelevant
These bitches got too many flaws
Ass shots is irrelevant
Real diamond, no flaws
Fake jewelry is irrelevant

[Verse 1:]
Rappers got so many flaws
Turn gay soon as they get in
Nigga you ain't no boss
Really you just in your feelings
I'm a real street nigga, ain't no changing that
This rap shit is whack, I use this shit just to promote the trap
Got to move this dope, got to move them packs
Got to run up a sack
I listen to your music, I think you whack
All you rappers sound alike, that's why I make count music
I don't stop at red lights
Real talk that's irrelevant

[Hook:]
Niggas got so many flaws
So having friends is irrelevant
The real [?]
You other niggas is irrelevant
These bitches got too many flaws
Ass shots is irrelevant
Real diamond, no flaws
Fake jewelry is irrelevant

[Verse 2:]
Every day got to take my medicine
That shit you rap irrelevant
Anything I put my hands on you know I'm fucking stretching it
Look at my iced out niggas, that bullshit chain irrelevant
Put everything out on the floor, you know I'm fucking [?]
Man I get all the weed I want, I know 100 [?]
You ain't do shit with your last plug, so you irrelevant
And you can't trust these niggas cause these pussies telling
Put 500 on the road, the other 5 I'm mailing it
That's real talk, no flaws
I probably blew 5 million
You got to watch these pussy niggas
Cause in the streets it's a lot of fake friends

[Hook:]
Niggas got so many flaws
So having friends is irrelevant
The real [?]

These bitches got too many flaws
