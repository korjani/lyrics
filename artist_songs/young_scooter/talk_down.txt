[Intro:]
Yeah
Rest in peace
To the OGB
True story nigga
Let's go

[Chorus:]
Half these niggas ain't down for you
They'll let you down
I went to jail
And Devil died on me
I asked God would he still [?]
I heard my partners talking down on me
Say I ain't got
Niggas swear to God
I'm lying
Kep told me he'd die for me
That's my right hand partner
Till I die

[Verse 1:]
Marco, Lil' Nuke and OG Boo
Know a couple real niggas
From the horseshoe
In Four Seasons
Crip Blue
My diamonds see through
So all you fake niggas
I can see through
Broke bitches I don't need you
In the streets how you eating
I can feed you
In all that hate
Turn into a young rich dude
I own the streets
So I can put em' on curfew
A nigga shot your partner in the face
Tell me how the fuck you let that shit slide
Real life
No R. Kelly
I'm a tell you right now
Pussy nigga
You can't fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Went in chasing some money
Cash came with the fame
Gettin' that junk in the game
High rollers and driving [?]
And then these niggas changed on me
Dang
These niggas ain't the same homie
Even when I was struggling
I still had me a vision
To go chase me a million
Take all of my niggas with me
Then there was a slight change on me
Boy, my niggas weren't the same homie
Dang
Hey Cub, remember the first time you met
Uncle Dub
In the club pouring that Moet
Gave us a glove
[?] look back nigga, nah
This shit ain't just rap nigga

[Chorus]
