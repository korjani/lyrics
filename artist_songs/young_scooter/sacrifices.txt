Yeah you know how it go, sacrifices

Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won't sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life
I had plug ties, I had to make a sacrifice
I can never sell my soul would never sacrifice
Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
Every day I'm making jug, I don't want your sacrifice
Make sure all my niggas cool, a lot of sacrifice

Made it in the rap game they say I'm Illuminati
It's a scarifice for who to shake they hands and found it
I'm a sacrifice the lean but I'm still on the Molly's
Stay down on that corner till I made a profit
Look at me now, rich nigga with millionaire outfit
I see you fried I'm on the top and ain't no way to stop me
I'm a boss I don't need nobody
I got me, put the hood on my face I know my niggas got me
Fifteen years right no license I will sacrifice
You pussy niggas buy love when that shit is priceless
You have 80mil hoe I'll take a 40 from it
And sign a prenup when you matter she don't have no money

Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won't sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life
I had plug ties, I had to make a sacrifice
I can never sell my soul would never sacrifice
Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
Every day I'm making jug, I don't want your sacrifice
Make sure all my niggas cool, a lot of sacrifice

So sacrifice Tony stright took his life
It ain't no sacrifice bossing joy and bricks for white
You got the juice now since he quit bitching
Kill my homeboy, I sacrificed a whole city
They kill you kid then fuck that let's get these niggas
I wish I never 'fronted you okay I got a kid
Sacrifice my life everyday look how I living
You can't trust these dirty bitches
They sacrifice their lives for money
I can't stand a petty nigga that sacrifice they life for nothing

Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won't sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life
I had plug ties, I had to make a sacrifice
I can never sell my soul would never sacrifice
Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
Every day I'm making jug, gotta make that sacrifice
Make sure all my niggas cool, a lot of sacrifice

I watched a lot of niggas in this game sacrifice just like I did
