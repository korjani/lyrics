[Hook - Young Scooter:]
Show you right [x2]
You say you a plug nigga show you right
Show you right [x2]
It's a dirty world this shit ain't right

[Verse 1 - Young Scooter:]
Look how they killed Mike Brown
So I ain't gon' hold my hands up, I'm holding my own hands down
Straight clutching on that pistol cause I don't play around
Dirty cops and dirty judges got my hood towed down
Lil Mexico the city
It's a whole lot of drugging
I own that bitch show you right
And don't you stop make some traffic light

[Bridge - LV, (Young Scooter:]
Get you some bricks [?] (show you right)
Did you really have the clientele (show you right)
Scooter is the real jury nigga (show you right)
Don't leave the house without yo pistol nigga (show you right)

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - LV:]
It's a dirty dirty world but we live in it
I'm just strapped up still tryna serve in it
In 12 killing so I'm living like the Purge in it
And got a whole lot stuck on my [?]
Just another young nigga having thangs
But 12 killing us and beating us on the fucking stand
All my needs is [?]
Show you right the lifestyle I live out here in [?]
For the young niggas dropping us and won't ain't taking our life
Ye I really sold bags of gas, pressure
[?] stretcher
