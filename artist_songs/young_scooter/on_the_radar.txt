[Verse 1:]
On my way to Cali with all these bricks
With all red on in the hood with the Crips
When I'm in the red zone I touch down with them bricks
You got a fed phone when you answer it click
Need you dead homie if you ain't told your clique
One phone down 20 niggas I done seen that shit
One brick to 3 bricks I really did that shit
So when I say the streets mine I really mean that shit

[Hook:]
So mothafuck you haters
I'm a get this paper
1000 bricks coming I can see it on the radar
Wierd lil' Mexico that's right by the [?]
And don't you niggas come in to my spot without the paper
Black Migos, Black Migos
4-5-6 [?]
That's a headcrack but I got bricks to blow
House full of packs, Sonny get the dough

[Verse 2:]
Jug at the dough, he got half the money
Sold it unsuspicious I start thinking funny
Plug didn't wait, he just take the money
Man that's how we play, you must be up or something
And I'm on 3 drugs, I stay high
Made a cooter straight finnesing now it's worldwide
I'm from the apartments and now I'm worldwide
I set the volume on the streets I turn it up and down
I whip my dope in certain days it going up and down
Come up short with the check, black him gun him down
Niggas hate the way I move my niggas don't play around
I'm with you I do the talking they don't make a sound

[Hook]
