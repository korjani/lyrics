Lil Mexico, that's the hood I'm from
And everybody there eatin'
Edgewood is the hood I roam
And all my niggas they eatin'
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico is the hood I'm from
And all my niggas they eatin'

Bubba back home, and Yo back locked up
Thank God this fucking rap game saved us
Plugs snitching so the dope game fucked up
I found some loopholes in my case, they fucked up
Fresh out of jail, fresh out of jail
They want me locked down, and I could tell
Clientele, clientele
Young Scooter, I can rerock a bale
In every hood and every state in the world
It's a nigga who snitching
And every time a nigga get shot or robbed
They put my name in an instant
But fuck 'em

Lil Mexico, that's the hood I'm from
And everybody there eatin'
Edgewood is the hood I roam
And all my niggas they eatin'
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico is the hood I'm from
And all my niggas they eatin'
