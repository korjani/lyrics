How the hell I'm gon' flop
I'm signed to the street
The streets ain't going nowhere niga
Black Migo

Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I bought that drop top at the pot
I know why yo L flopped, he was impatient
And the label got control of your situation
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block

If I sign the dotted line I want back every dime
I spend like two million dollars to sign the way I sign
The reason you having problems you don't know how to grind
You may hide some and put em at the wrong time
Young Scooter blowing weed like a chimney
I could never flop cause I'm not in the industry
I'm in the streets drilling that's where scooter be
And I got all the dope they call me Bill G
The check you got for your advance I blow that every week
I don't shake every body hand I don't know who you be
A major label push your project, all I got's the streets
Black Amigo gang nigga all we got is we

Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I bought that drop top at the pot
I know why yo L flopped, he was impatient
And the label got control of your situation
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block

Scooter try so much I bought the clothing line
Range Rover game over that's for my niggas and [?]
Baking soda, cocaine powder at my mama house
Can't fold my money so the rest that's how I blow em out
I don't trust these niggas and they don't trust me
Put a statement, cut my time, I was a trustee
Oh yeah my block stay hot shout out to Weezy Wee
Young nigga with an attitude and rest in peace to Eazy E
I move my niggas move so don't you disrespect my G
I respect every real nigga in these fucking streets
I don't give a damn bout this music nigga that's where I be
Look down at the pavement they landed out in these streets

Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I bought that drop top at the pot
I know why yo L flopped, he was impatient
And the label got control of your situation
Ain't no way in hell I could flop
I'm married to the streets across the block
