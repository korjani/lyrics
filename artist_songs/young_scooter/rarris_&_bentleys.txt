Me and Future was broke, we was ridin' my baby mama's Pontiac
This right around the same time that Guwop dropped Ice Attack
Finesse for 200 racks and he had a heart attack
We juggin out Atlanta where the models and robbers at
Corvette Stingray, that's just the lick talk
I'm jumping out anyway, what the fuck I need license for?
They catch me with this pistol, yeah my judge don't give a fuck
She say I'll get the max if I come back in front of her
Don't smoke in foreign cars, fuck it, I'm smoking anyway
OG Kush in glass jars, keep it strong like propane
In the 90's cook out jars, now we cookin' out everything
Got a Bentley and Rari off the pot and the dope game

Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and Bentley's, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and chickens, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's

Twenty twenty vision, I can see through niggas
They hate to see Scooter pull up in that Bentley
I let the top down so you can see me nigga
Come and swerve through your hood
I got nobody with me
Jump in my Ferrari, go and smash on the expressway
Yeah I fuck with Ross, my whole hood 'bout Gunplay
I green light your block, that mean it's trouble 'round your way
Can't have no pistols in New York, hell I'm gon' bring mine anyway
Now me and Future rich, you know we worldwide superstars
Quarter million dollar foreign nigga, it's no more rental cars
Rari's and Bentley's and Aston Martin's, exotic cars
Black Amigo Gang, nigga you know who I do it for

Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and Bentley's, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and chickens, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's

Push start, no keys
I got bricks, Alicia Keys
Stop rapping 'bout dope, they like Scooter please
You got to cut
Better warm your car before you even leave
Why these niggas hating, 'cause I'm riding Rari's and Bentley's nigga?
This shit ain't come for free, I had to sleep in the damn kitchen
So I'm a flex every chance I get on you pussy niggas
I'm the answer to the streets, who got a question, I own 'em nigga

Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Cutlass Monte Carlo's and Regals nigga
That was in the 90's, now it's Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and Bentley's, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's
Rari's and chickens, Rari's and Bentley's
Bentley's and Rari's, Rari's and Bentley's
