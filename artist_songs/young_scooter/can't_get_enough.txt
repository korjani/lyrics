Grinding, I can't get enough
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough
Serving, I can't get enough
Rocking shows, I can't get enough
I'm 'bout my issue, I can't get enough
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough
Going to court, I can't get enough
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough

Bitch I'm mister fall out king
Now back a thousand times, n'aw mean?
Life over a triple beam
When you park it, it ain't what it seems
Count up a hundred, dope feel like a dream
I'm in the kitchen doing my fucking thing
Jet lag, shit from time zoning
Link up with [?] when I'm town touring
Spot talk with the best on
Surround myself with bosses like a fucking don
Net [?] on the socket homie
Black Amigo Gang, what's a drought homie?

Grinding, I can't get enough
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough
Serving, I can't get enough
Rocking shows, I can't get enough
I'm 'bout my issue, I can't get enough
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough
Going to court, I can't get enough
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough

[Young Scooter:]
Real dope boy, jugg king
I walk around with 350 thousand dollar chains
Movin' bricks and bales way before this rap fame
I'm keep this shit 100, I can't switch lanes
I'm a boss and I can't get enough
Jugg, jugg, run your bands up
Jugg house with no cameras
It ain't shit off in these streets that I can't handle
My young niggas, they watch everything
Try to run off in my spot and it's a murder scene
Section 8 housing, low it down with pounds of weed
Ain't no clean around here, remix king

Grinding, I can't get enough
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough
Serving, I can't get enough
Rocking shows, I can't get enough
I'm 'bout my issue, I can't get enough
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough
Going to court, I can't get enough
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough

Gas bag stanking
Young Scooter vacuum seal 'em
I'm on stage jumpin' 'round, now what's the dealing?
Pockets stick out like a cellphone, nigga really?
Independent hooping, ballin' like we major dealing
I went straight to the cash
Foot on the gas
Show you how to hustle nigga
You really want bags
Represent for the hoes that be shaking ass
Shout out to the trap nigga
Serving gas
And I'm addicted, I can't get enough
Addicted to the dog food just like the blood
[?] from counting racks gave me a rush
And I'm a painkiller user, I don't toot dust

Grinding, I can't get enough
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough
Serving, I can't get enough
Rocking shows, I can't get enough
I'm 'bout my issue, I can't get enough
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough
Going to court, I can't get enough
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough
