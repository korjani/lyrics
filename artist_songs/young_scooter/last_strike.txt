Trap house on the, trap house on the track

My lawyer called I'm on my last strike
Two time convicted felon don't need a third strike
My phone ringing nigga sum'n ain't right

Fifty bags a day that's what the trap bring
Push that count music nigga you can trap three
But just don't let the streets trap you

Vacuum unpacked, busting them dead
Carrying that posted, living on the edge
