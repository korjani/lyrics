Bob Marley
We smoke out the papers
Dreads in my head like I'm Jamaican
Bob Marley
Just smoke a quarter pound a week
That's a pound every month for the free
I be 'round the top shottas
Boss man Scooter, done dada
Bob Marley
I never cross my niggas
Get a 100 mill then come and whip it

Rock O's, rock shows, let the dice roll
Bankrolls, oh no, money can't fold
Range Rov, all gold, that shit come with a stove
Price low, coupe low, with butterfly doors
Young Scooter, smoke Bob Marley papers
Top down, riding through Decatur
Bob Marley, bombaclot like I'm from Kingston
These niggas'll never know what the fuck I'm thinking
Roll weed, long way, nigga no C
OG Cali Kush, that's inside me
Crack baby, cocaine in my IV
Smoked an ounce in an hour, me and Wiz Khalif'

Bob Marley
We smoke out the papers
Dreads in my head like I'm Jamaican
Bob Marley
Just smoke a quarter pound a week
That's a pound every month for the free
I be 'round the top shottas
Boss man Scooter, done dada
Bob Marley
I never cross my niggas
Get a 100 mill then come and whip it
