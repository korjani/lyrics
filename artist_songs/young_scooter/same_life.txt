[Intro:]
Ha Ha Ha Ha
I told you Zay
We going on the jiggathon lata
I'm the king of the motherfucking streets

[Chorus:]
Nigga's so fake
Don't know who is real
Take the stand on my niggas
Boy I never will
Still have whips and bricks
Without a record deal
Young Scooter live a life
You fake rappers live
And I ball without a record deal
Buy the mall without a record deal
Young Scooter live the same life
You rappers live
But I ain't got no record deal

[Verse 1:]
Fuck a record deal
All this can't be real
The team move these bricks
And get with [?]
My nigga feel
When I found this rap shit
I turned a couple mil
T-twenty thousand for a show
Without a record deal
Most these rappers gay
Bought they cars and cribs
Suck a nigga dick
Just to get a record deal
These niggas ain't never seen shit
So fuck how you feel
Zone six made me rich
Man Juiceman

[Verse 2:]
Been had whips and bricks
Been had racks and bitches
Been spending on the corner
Big balls and some switches
Been riding Benz in line
On my own line
Pussy nigga sweeney
Just another [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What you gonna do
When it's slow
Your boy ain't got no blow
You niggas rappin bout it
Aren't really [?]
I'm talking fish scale
For the show and tell
Real talk
A quarter million boxes
Out the mail
Ballin without a deal
Living like the majors live
Most these rappers too fake
I call it how I see it
Man these nigga's pussy
Pussy I can't whip
Don't believe half these pussy ass
[?]
Get a 36
Swim baby swim
Now I'm standing in the kitchen
Jumpin out the gym
Niggas sold they soul
For some fake gems
Now he think he ballin
With them itty bitty rims

[Chorus]
