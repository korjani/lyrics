[Hook - Young Scooter:]
Police kickin' in my mama's door, you ain't ready for that lifestyle
Look at all these lights and cameras nigga, you ain't ready for that lifestyle

Soo many nights man, I thought I wasn't gon' see this year
You know my album is on the way, all of my new shit is all the way outta here
You know I keep it gang of bad bitches, my new bitch is all the way outta here
I was just serving my aunties and uncles I was just hungry for money
Police be knockin' on young nigga's doors, knowin' nigga's off abroad
Back in the 6th grade, they think that they got me, they thought that they figured it out
They tried to take niggas on whole 'nother route, worded this shit is about
Money, mo' money, mo' money and greed, money, mo' money and greed
They didn't want us to succeed
Most of the, most of the, most of the shit that we did, we can't talk about never again, never again
Livin' this life in that sin, yeah
