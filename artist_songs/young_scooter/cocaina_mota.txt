[Hook:]
Mota, mota, Migo
Scooter, Black Amigo
Yeah, I got cocaino
We got barrels of yayo
Road runnin' every day, tryin' out the formula
On the way to Little Mexico, just left Laredo
Cocaina mota, cocaina mota
Cocaina mota, cocaina mota
Black Migo cook the dope without the baking soda
Cocaina mota, cocaina mota

[Verse 1:]
Squad's hot, nigga, so we wrap the bricks like tacos
Don't you pull up at the spot if you don't want a hundo
Face card plugged in, bricks out the front door
Tryna run off with the pack, I let the shotty slump em
You know I can make the dope, I love to change the nombre
Damn right I'm loyal to Hector, but I can't cross my ese
Street smart, all my juug houses on a one-way
So don't you make the wrong turn, 'cause we ain't playing this way
Cocaina stretchin', wrap the mota in plastic, bag it up and sell it
Freebandz automatic
Twenty four hours, open automatic
The biggest plug in Atlanta, I've got all the traffic

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Nino Brown, operation Mexico the Carter
Catch them rubbers when the dope off in that water
Salute my migo La Pedro and Guala
Like they got caught up, Raffaello took them charges
A thousand bricks in the safe house, that's the pack vault
Step up with the rich gang, nigga, let them birds talk
You better watch what you say, my nigga, before your plug fall
Foreign plug speak different type of language you don't know about
Bales of mota, we got lots of those
Just left the studio, back to them pots and stoves
Bricks of coca, we got lots of those
My migo partner gave me a brick for a show
