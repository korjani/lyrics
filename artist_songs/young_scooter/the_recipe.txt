[Young Scooter:]
All you pussy niggas coppin' pleas
Like you convicted a felony
You lil niggas ain't beefin' 'bout money
You might as well call off all beefs
Turn fifty to 200 Gs
Bitch I got the recipe
Black Amigo, we speak guapanese
You can hate but ain't gon' fuck with me

You gotta watch who you sell that dope
Because these pussy niggas coppin' pleas
I do what the fuck I want, bitch I'm a street lottery
Trap runnin' like 24, we got indoors, we got outdoors
We take a week to sell 20 pounds
But fuck nigga your trap slow
I got truckloads like Costco
I got tons of gas like Texaco
Hundred real niggas 'round me
From Edgewood to Lil Mexico
Trap house with no doors
A couple mill out the dope bowl
I see through these fake ass niggas
And no I do not trust hoes
You niggas ain't beefin' 'bout money
You niggas rather beef 'bout a bitch

All you pussy niggas coppin' pleas
Like you convicted a felony
You lil niggas ain't beefin' 'bout money
You might as well call off all beefs
Turn fifty to 200 Gs
Bitch I got the recipe
Black Amigo, we speak guapanese
You can hate but ain't gon' fuck with me

[Jose Guapo:]
I got to ride with the rifle
I got to ride with the bible
I got to keep it beside me
I got to keep it beside me
I got a book bag beside me
It got a QP inside it
I'm a hit hard when we [?]
Young Guapo might start up a riot
We did this shit for the streets
I count up the money with street
Young Guapo don't fuck with you creeps
Get it back in every week
Niggas been callin' off beef
Talkin' 'bout 200 to 3
We know you gon' cop a plea
You was never in the streets
Don't know you, I speak guapanese
We want them pints and them Ps
[?] Hendrix with me
Got too much money on me
Smoke on that reefer and choke
Scooter just got off a boat
Got shooters you know that they toke
Young Guapo, I'm far from a ho
