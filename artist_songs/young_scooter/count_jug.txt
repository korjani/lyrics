[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Shit fucked up right now in every hood
My face hot in Edgewood and Kirkwood
Ain't worrying about this rap, they want me for them jug
The streets talking, they say they know the moves I pull
White chalk shit I say the word they'll do it
But we don't want no problems all we do is jug
Juggin' out them Section 8 houses in the hood
I love all my niggas they make sure I'm good
And I make sure they good
We all bosses, a couples losses, but no crosses

I gotta keep counting, keep juugin'

So I respect the real OG's of every hood
Young niggas 15 juggin' getting to it

Thinking 'bout why the Feds keep on talking crazy
Cuz all the snitches saying jug and that word I made it
Count Up!
