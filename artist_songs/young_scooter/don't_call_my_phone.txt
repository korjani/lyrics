[Hook:]
Please don't call my phone
The streets high, everybody snitching
It's too much going on
Keep it low key
Please don't call my phone
It's too much going on

[Verse:]
Throw them racks on [?] put it on yo face
Fucking pussy nigga throw the body in the lake
We sold the crack on the corner then our boss came
I got the rollie and the beamer see my [?]
I bought 2 benzes on the mofucking same day
I think you niggas [?] shoot em in the face
I rubber band my money like I'm still selling yay
I'm on [?]
I'm on the drank I swear the shit help me [?]
A million dollars nigga when I walk I grab a take
A trillion dollars nigga middle fingers to the fed
I gave a lot of rappers wife I'm bout to take away

[Hook]
