[Hook: Future]
A lot of money, have you like you on some acid
A lot of jewelry made me smash your baby mama
Miley Cyrus, got em ready for that drama
I cook that pot, I’m drankin, treat me like Obama
I got them collard greens on me like a farmer
Drive the Jaguar like a Yamaha
Clean drank these young niggas call it raw
Clean pussy, you gone make me fuck it raw, oh

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Shawty pussy clean, Aquafin
I ate that bitch out with the lean
You know I pull up flexing on the scene
And no this work is not clean
But my partner Future, he got raw
See I take pussy niggas off
Dope boy, they try to put me in the cross
I got money, ain’t nothing to take a loss

[Hook: Future]
A lot of money, have you like you on some acid
A lot of jewelry made me smash your baby mama
Miley Cyrus, got em ready for that drama
I cook that pot, I’m drankin, treat me like Obama
I got them collard greens on me like a farmer
Drive the Jaguar like a Yamaha
Clean drank these young niggas call it raw
Clean pussy, you gone make me fuck it raw, oh

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Trap house with the cameras, I got 20 in Atlanta
ChiChi get the yayo, call me Scooter Montana
I get off a truckload, ain’t shit I can’t handle
Your baby mama want to fuck my chain but you can have her
The first time I met her, yeah I fucked her raw
She sucked the dick so good it never go soft
In my juug house I got a pack vault
Do what the fuck I want to do cause I’m a boss

[Hook x2: Future]
A lot of money, have you like you on some acid
