[Hook - Young Thug:]
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready, we ready
We ready, we ready
We ready for war, we ready for war
Thug ready for war, street ready for war, war, war

[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]
Street, ready for war, now roll up
Weed, cut this product, yeah with the 'chete
If the bitch ain't pretty she petty
Feed 'em all of the fish and get fatter
We back to back with the car like margielies
Bitch, is you ready?, heeey
I can lock you down with these racks and this credit
Huh, I'm ready
Buy you the coupe on Sunday
Take her to movies on Monday
Fuck a lil bitch on this suede, aye
Diamonds or VVS
Fresh and clear out the place
Gold, no ace of spades
I'm ready, I'm ready

[Hook - Young Thug:]
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready, we ready
We ready, we ready
We ready for war, we ready for war
Thug ready for war, street ready for war, war, war

[Verse 2 - Young Scooter:]
SKs, AKs, blatt!, push a pussy nigga face back
Turn your head to spaghetti, we like decoratin' white tees
Scooter Montana, I told you niggas don't fuck with me
I got a check, but I ain't up as I'm suppose to be
This real talk nigga, I don't rap no porch
I been jumped off my mama and my grandma porch
A hunnid choppas with a hunnid rounds, nigga who want 'em?
I'm ready, is you ready? just don't freeze up on me
Rich [?], that dope, my niggas will drown out on me
It ain't no movement in my kitchen, ain't nothin' but countin' homie

[Hook - Young Thug:]
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready, we ready my nigga
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready for war, we ready for war
We ready, we ready
We ready, we ready
We ready for war, we ready for war
Thug ready for war, street ready for war, war, war
