Long live OGD
In loving memory

[Verse 1:]
They killed my nigga Double that shit fucked me up
The police snatched me up like I did something
And me and Pimp we're locked up, he'd be right there with us
My nigga steady turnt up I'm talkin' fly as fuck
Yea, In loving memory
Thank you for that life G
Real OG used to work a bitch
I'm talkin Pimp C, out I shoot a snitch
Million dollars' worth of foreign, million worth of jug
2 million dollars, takin chances, damn it I wash in blood
Told me keep you on the music, let's turn up the mood
I know you work behind the shoot, I said flex and jug

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
All my songs stories, I'm talking memories
So when I die know the whole world remember me
Realest OG I ever met, I'm talkin' OGD
I let him down, he in the ground and that shit hurtin' me
Right now I ain't in my right mind
These niggas hate to see you shine and tryna take yo shine
And I don't need a clock, nigga I'm ahead of time
Brought that Maybach to the hood and shit that be a sign
A week later he died in the same car I drove
Seen it on the news in the car man broke the phone
Wish I was on my know, he wouldn't been on no kind of road
Yea man, Pimp locked up and OG Double gone

[Hook]
