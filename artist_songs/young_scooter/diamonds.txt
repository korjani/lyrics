[Young Scooter:]
Yeah, haha
All these motherfucking diamonds turnt
All this Eliantte jewelry, count up

Diamond chain, diamond chain
Rolex watch, diamond chain
Diamond chain, diamond chain
Petite Philipe and diamond chain
Cool the dope off with the ice cubes
My life a movie bitch, like Ice Cube
Cocaine and diamond chains
Rolex watches and diamond rings

Four diamond chains, four watches too
Lil Mexico one with the 44 crew
Protect came inside the Bentley coupe
I got 6 gold rings like pimping do
All iced out, Eliantte, my diamonds hitting hard like photoshoot
Bling-bling, I got cash money, no baby food
I ain't never seen the drop
[?] ain't shining when the lights out
I got bricks in the couch
Pounds in the kitchen, I sleep in the juug house
I put wings on bails, fly 'em to your hood nigga, count that check out
I throw diamonds in the pot, cool the dope off, a nigga get stressed out
I bought my jewelry off dope money, you bought your jewelry off show money
I'm my own boss nigga, I ain't got no big homie
100 rats busting down the wrapper
I'm a real Lil Mexico trapper
Lil fake ass jewelry you niggas wearing, you rappers should be actors, Scooter

Diamond chain, diamond chain
Rolex watch, diamond chain
Diamond chain, diamond chain
Petite Philipe and diamond chain
Cool the dope off with the ice cubes
My life a movie bitch, like Ice Cube
Cocaine and diamond chains
Rolex watches and diamond rings

[Don Q:]
I told Eliantte hold a Rollie for me
He said, "cool, you got 40 for me?"
I got these bitches tryna auction on me
Yeah I'm dripping and flossin, yeah I keep a faucet on me
They calling reporters on me
I cannot trust anybody that walk up on me
Be cautious homie
I see these robbers, they plotting, they want what's on me
I'm still in the street but I move like a star
I shoot at my neighbors and move out tomorrow
Smoking on gorilla blue out the jar
Bubba always got that tool in the car
I met Scooter at the jewelry spot
I had to show that night, I had to jewelry shop
In the X-53 with the ceiling drop
They don't believe that is me so I peel the top
We get on the flight and we hung in PR with the killers at night
Who had the torch? You can't sit at the light
And me and Boogie had a million in ice
This money, I made it myself
I will not hate on myself
That's why I stay to myself
I pray for my enemies more than I pray for myself
Cause I keep the K on the shelf

[A Boogie With Da Hoodie:]
I called my homie Gunny
I told y'all to hold the Rollie for me
41 bezel, I'm only 20
Call me A Boogie, don't call me lucky
I'm paid in full, you ain't got no money
My diamonds shine bright like it's always sunny
My diamonds come right out Eliantte
That Patek Philippe, that's 100 on me
If you reach, I teach, I go Curry on 'em
If the beat for me, I go dummy on it
Is she cheat on me, I'm a fuck 'em up
But if you eat the cheese, you an undercover
I don't speak to D's, I know better
When she off the E, the head is better
She gon' reach for the F on my Fendi sweater
I don't give a fuck, bitch I'm a GR letter
I went to Puerto Rico
Eliantte bought a kilo
I went underwater right when I put on the kilo
I look at my nigga Nemo
I walk in the store and I pull out a bunch of c-notes
Fuck up a nigga ego
Fly like a eagle, might pull out a Desert Eagle
I am [?] people, we was never equal
