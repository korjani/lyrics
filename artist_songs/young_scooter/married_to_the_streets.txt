One thing about me, yeah I'm a run my money up
One thing about me, yeah I'm a fuck her when I fuck
One thing about me, one thing about me, thing about me

[Verse 1 - Young Scooter & Young Thug:]
I'm in that Masi I feel like a spider
G5 just feeling flyer

Backseat of the Maybach, me and Thug countin'
I done made a half million off of mixtapes
I done made a whole million on my mixtapes
Nigga playing with the Act', Perc, bust his grapes
I'm on time with the pack nigga I'm never late

And I got bricks and bales, wraps of option
Try pull up for a nigga one thing might meet me nigga
I'm finessing and juggin' these fake street niggas
I got Scooter straight up out of the streets on BET
Thugger, Thugger dirty young nigga he just like me
Birdies and Audis, Scooter with me
Open my door with a phone I don't need no key
Begets and VVS inside of my neck and wrist
Real diamonds, 100 karats, bling bling
