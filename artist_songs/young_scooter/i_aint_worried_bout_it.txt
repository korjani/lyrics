[Hook - Young Scooter:]
Young Scooter run the streets, I know you heard about it
A lot of niggas hate on me but I ain't worried about it
I put the packs in every hood, I know you heard about it
I know a lot of niggas snitching, I ain't worried about it
I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
I took a loss for two mill but I ain't worried about it
I ain't got no record deal but I ain't worried about it

[Verse 1 - Ralo:]
Ralo got ammo, how the fuck you run this shit
Look who I'm running with, we put the streets on [?]
We locked it down but we ain't throw away the keys
Ain't cripping but we balling overseas
Bringing the Bentley [?] to the penitentiary
Mind your business, my folks need a visit
Fuck a deal, we been [?]
Made millions, made all of these niggas get in they feelings
I got that [?] and I ain't talking aids
I don't stand in line for Js, I got a line of Js
Fuck buying them Js, the Js buy em for me
Fuck a 9 to 5, come buy a 9 from me

[Verse 2 - Young Scooter:]
Tank caught a 22 but he ain't worried about it
Guwop got a 3 and a half but he ain't worried about it
These niggas tryna buy a half but I don't serve nobody
They say when you in the streets then you can't trust nobody
But I trust [?] so nigga fuck everybody
Look how they set up stoner Rick but he ain't worried about it
See when you playing with them bricks you can't trust anybody
They say I look like a lick but I ain't worried about it
I get your bitch ass killed and never worry bout you
You broke as hell, I'm filthy rich, and I ain't worried about you
You say you from the streets, never heard about you
Little pussy ass nigga, I ain't worried about you
Out here my lingo with everybody, me and [?] ain't worried about you
