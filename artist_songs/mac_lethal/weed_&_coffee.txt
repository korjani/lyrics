Yo, uh

I don't drive a Bentley, or a Benz or a Beamer
I don't drive an Audi or a Lamborghini either
I don't push a range round town just to act paid
Only money that i got is change in my ashtray
I don't drive a Porsche
I don't drive a rolls royce
I don't drive feraris
I don't even drive a volvo
Wanna get up in my car you have to squeeze
Because my motherfucking car is Japanese
I drive a Honda
And no sir i did not lease i bought a god damn honda
I be getting Whole Foods bitches
You be getting Olive Garden bitches with the bronzer
I own a Honda
Spent the extra money on a vaporizer for my marijuana
Grip that steering wheel
Irish boy with a mean left hand looking like Conor
Picture me rolling in a Toyota Corolla with 100,000 miles
Im a veteran nothing to play with
This one for the Nissans and Kias
And the Hyundais or Hun-dais or the however the fuck you say it
Rappers always spending their money on these pricey ass automobiles
Looking like idiots
I'm from the midwest with enough [?]
Whether to impress
I don't want a nice car
Not even a little bit

All I really care about is cruising through the city
With my windows down so back the hell up off me
All I wanna do is wake up early in the morning
Smoke a little weed and drink some fucking coffee
Yeah

I don't ever do hard drugs
Just moderate drinking
Lately I've been trying to be sober during the weekend
Exercising everyday for my good health
Lower the anxiety that I feel being my good self
I don't need sweets
I don't need fried food
Grass fed butter in my coffee is a great brew
Before an apple a day would keep the doctor away
Then imagine what would happen if you ate two

I used to feel the pressure
'til i learned a couple lessons
Living life and always stressing
Had no answer to my question
Started thinking about the poison
I put up inside of my physical body
Came to the conclusion
Living healthy is an essence
Man, I gotta have the energy
To be a better father
Gotta focus
So i could put a couple dollars in a closed fist
Smoke a little marijuana
Never smoke cigs
And exercise so I don't grow tits
Lift weights
Compound movements
Leg day
Deep squats
Drop down, do it
Build your skills and find yourself a career
Can't be 35 still living at your mom's house stupid
I got friends that got habits that are so bad
I guarantee they're gonna die of a heart attack
You gotta make choices that positively benefit you
For fucks sake how hard is that

All I really care about is cruising through the city
With my windows down so back the hell up off me
All I wanna do is wake up early in the morning
Smoke a little weed and drink some fucking coffee
Yeah

For the first time in my life
I can see myself with my eyes closed
I can see the things that I hide from the world
I can see the things that only time shows
So what has time shown?
Time has shown
That every single person I have known
Is gonna suffer everyday and die alone [x2]

For the first time in my life
I can see myself with my eyes closed
I can see the things that I hide from the world
I can see the things that only time shows
So what has time shown?
Time has shown
That every single person I have known
Is gonna suffer everyday if they don't have weed and coffee

Uh. caffeine and weed are drugs too mac

Shut the fuck up
