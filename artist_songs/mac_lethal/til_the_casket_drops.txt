Life is crazy sometimes
Give a lot of days of my life up to my haters
But I'ma make this one mine
Take a couple photographs of my pretty family in the bright and hazy sunshine
When the aperture's perfect
It's the golden hour, gonna pull the power
From the Sun and its lavender surface
Got a new lens
I got a lot of family but few friends
I know that's cliche shit to say
But reality rap is a challenge, cuz facts are facts
And can't go many different ways
Fuck it, here we are
It ain't guaranteed that you'll be here tomorrow
You live life like you got an extra day to do shit
And you'll day in a leap year, it's harsh
So do it all today
Or in 20 years you're gonna look at life like you threw it all away
Ain't no guarantees but I guarantee
If you have a little veggies and some juice you'll calm your day
I don't wanna lie to you for the fame or the money
Maybe I could take the truth a longer way
I've had writer's block to this beat for a full year
Fuck it, I'ma do the song today
Gonna finish it and love it
Then I mix it and I dub it
Then I send it to the public
If they're dissing it then fuck it
Doesn't matter my opinion is I'm ripping it
And crushing it the dissonance is fucking sick
All the critics they can suck a dick
Every single fuckin' day I'm getting up at 6
Then I feed my kids, then I hit this studio
Then I spew a flow so beautiful, you should know

[Chorus:]
The universe is expanding
I don't give a fuck I'm drinking all day
All the dreams I have are in color
Even though my memories are all grey
Man the whole damn world is burning
But you'd never know because you're too busy
Staring at your phone
Only way that I can feel happiness is when
I'm by myself standing here along
Just me til the casket drops
Just me til the casket drops
Just me til the casket drops
Just me til the casket drops

Not a day goes by where I don't think about how the world's all fucked up
All it takes is a car wreck, cancer virus
Or a member of ISIS on a random Tuesday with a gun going buck buck!
And you're outta here
You don't know what second, what day, what month, what year
But one day, you are gonna disappear
And 99% of the planet ain't even gonna care
Except the people at your funeral who clap and cheer
As they reflect on your life with laughs and tears
When they drop your casket and the energy leaves your body
And it supernovas through the atmosphere
And it travel years through a black-hole
Where time gets so slow it stops
...then reverses...
Now you're turning back the years
Going back in time
To the days when you just a curious kid with a fragile mind
Laying on your back
Looking up at the night sky... wondering
What the Hell is past the line
Of the solar system?
And you're thinking to yourself
"Geez, this is an incredible life,"
As you try to look deep into the delicate night
Smoking weed wondering if you're inhaling it right
And you wanna know...
Do distant planets have intelligent life?
Well of course they do
And they might have big red eyes
Or big green thumbs, or skin light blue
But a lot of them are just like you
They prolly spend half their day just staring at a mobile phone
Because they feel like in the universe they're so alone
Well guess what, now you know they're wrong
This song is over... gone

[Chorus]
