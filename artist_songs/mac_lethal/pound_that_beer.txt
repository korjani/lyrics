Beer! Makes us fired up!
So come on, drink it all night long!
Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl!
Slam it girl! Where's the marching band at?
Pound that beer, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer
Pound that beer, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer!

Bubble on back to the bar stool, I will
My pill, might dissolve on my tongue
Fuck that Jagermeister bullshit
That DUI hurt a little bit now I'm all done
No, can I go to the liquor sto' and buy that poison
Hey pretty thing, right there, yeah you, I hate your boyfriend!
I don't give a fuck if he a vigilante[?] anywhere
Kill him on his incubator rhythm like this
Pop that, bottle top, talk back, that about says it all
Let him meet my fist
Gotta a beer and a
Our kisses taste like alcohol you know that means its love
Switch it
Here's another reason that I'm gonna take you home
Cause I can't be a fiesty little freak when I'm alone
Oh my goodness who the hell is blowing up my phone?
This better be important, don't you understand I'm drinkin beer?
Can't you feel the spiders, they're buried deep inside us
The politicians, officers and judges are vampires
I never once suggested that we tie each other down
I think we should buy another round

Beer! Makes us fired up!
So come on, drink it all night long!
Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl!
Slam it girl! Where's the marching band at?
Pound that beer, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer
Pound that beer, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer!

How can I describe to you this?
See that lady over there got that poisonous kiss
Here another Cinnamint the element is in 'em
Is she lookin like a demon in a chemical abyss
But no, can I go to the liquor sto' and buy that poison?
Hey black angel, hey mama sue, I hate your boyfriend!
I can't lust, your battle won't fuck the measure up
Tho domestic I love the sex with no sums of sensual drugs,
Oh no, I got a thirty pack tho
Then again if the black ball melts
Took the original to get us high
Gotta get me inside
Gotta take that knife
Gotta scrape that pipe with your lit up eyes
Switch it!
Here's another reason my insanity has grown
Cause drama is so childish and fucking overblown
Oh my goodness who the hell is blowing up my phone?
This better be important don't you understand I'm drinking beer?
Can't you feel the spiders, they're buried deep inside us
The politicians, officers and judges are vampires
I never once suggested that we tie each other down
I think we should buy another round

Beer! Makes us fired up!
So come on, drink it all night long!
Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl! Slam it girl!
Slam it girl! Where's the marching band at?
Pound that beer, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer
Pound that be-e-e-er, pound that beer
Don't drunk dial, no, pound that beer!

Yes sir, this is one of those ignorant anthems.
Be an intellectual if you want.
But we got the nectar of the gods here.
Because we're drinkin what?
Beer! Makes us fired up!
So come on, drink it all night long!
Beer! Makes us fired up!
So come on, drink it all night long!
