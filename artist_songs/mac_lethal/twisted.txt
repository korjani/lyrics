Chop me up another line
Fast, I could never be high class
You can tell when I go out to dinner and get a hundred dollar merlot and guzzle on my wine glass
Got a lot of demons that are jumping out of my path, like hey there
You don't go to hell, man your born in hell
And if your sick in your heart you fuckin' stay there
Two cubes of ice and glenlivet in my glass
I'm all over the game, I ain't just in it for the cash
Even though I'm gonna die in the future I gotta stop living in the past or my enemies will pass me
Devil all in my nostril, angel all on my shoulder
Taking drugs it feels fake as fuck I guess wake me up when its over
Yo my baby mama through me out the car last week
Tonight we met up at the bar for a drink just to work things out within minutes we were fucking in my car back seat wooo!
I took a shot to the head in front of my bitch
Like John to the Kennedy F
I stay calm through the misery yes
I'm in the court room gone with the Hennessy breath
Like fuck you, your honour
I'm made of flesh I'm made of blood I'm made of water
And some alcoholism you know I got it from my mother
I just hate everybody you know I got it from my father
I'm just smoking on a bowl of medicinal marijuana
Time and time again I just sit around too patiently waiting for the weekend, just thinkin'
Its almost 5pm, I better start drinking ok!

[x2]
It makes no difference, makes no difference
Fuck it I'm getting twisted
Makes no difference, makes no difference
Fuck it I'm getting twisted
Makes no difference, makes no difference
Fuck it I'm getting twisted
I should probably die alone cause I'm impossible to live with

Yea my name is David, but the people that know me in real life know not to call me that
They just call me Mac and they know that nine times out of ten if they call I will call them back
No stories no excuses, no pretending that my phones dead
I don't give a fuck about your problems I'm just living in my own head
I don't want to over-complicate shit
Use a knife when you want that face-lift
Did you buy that Louis bag for your bitch cause you want to act rich or cause you want to act basic?
Still making rap beats in the basement
Taking blue pills in that matrix
If you ever feel like life is confusing remember [?] will make the entire universe make sense
The night I impregnated my wife with my son I ate a bunch of pot
Now hes 3 years old and now his IQ is high as fuck and every picture that he paints is incredible
It ain't no mystery its true, you take your imagination to a place that it never been to
In the foreign ass world and it turns a little bit new, a little bit new
I am a believer in the universe and [?] so I wish that I can move away to Jupiter tomorrow
And just to get the fuck away from other people on the planet
Man my day was just romantic [?] the people in Atlantis
Time and time again I just sit around too patiently waiting for the weekend, just thinkin'
Its almost 5 p.m., I better start drinking, ok!

It makes no difference, makes no difference
Fuck it I'm getting twisted

Fuck it I'm getting twisted
