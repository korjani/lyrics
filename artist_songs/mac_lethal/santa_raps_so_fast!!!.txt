I'm coming down the chimney like I'm Santa with an AK47
If you're naughty then I'm taking all your presents
It's December the 25th and if you're building in the way you should
I'm giving a couple gifts to all the children in your neighborhood
Unless you know somebody that's a rotten fucker
Then you better just believe that I'ma show at Christmas Eve
And then I'm gonna give their mom a muffler
As a stocking stuffer
Damn it, kid, I'm standing with an AK47 in the middle of the city
Where the criminals are gritty and they're tough!
Gotta entreprise a little bit and own a company
Cuz slaving for the man and making pennies ain't enough
It's Christmas but fuck your wish list cuz you're already gifted!
So give yourself independence and start your own business!
Gotta hustle with a vengeance here is some motivation
You may need and it's too damn true
Lil Wayne is only 5'5 mothafucka
If he can be successful then you can too!
You know I'm high up on the trees like an angel
I be rippin' to the rhythm of the sleigh bells
I don't care about a person saying they're a Rap God
Cuz when you're underground you gotta face hell
Just what I enjoy little drummer boy
Barum ba bum bum man, it is such a joy
When I'm going dumb da dumb I shoot a missile and destroy
Finding the work and finding a purpose like a kid that's unemployed
I'm drunk Santa Clause I just drank a fifth
Getting crazier than Jaden Smith
So you can tell The Grinch I put some mistletoe above my ass
And now he knows where to place his lips
Check it out, I'm vaping marijuana cuz it centers me
Is giving me the energy to rip the beat up vividly
And even when I'm 63 and when the air is so polluted
That it makes you sick to breathe I'll prolly be a sick MC
The sickest in the history of anything I went to war with 50 kings
And ate the planet Saturn in a single bite and sniffed the rings
You gotta take some shrooms and try to smoke dimethyltryptamine
To see a vision this incredible the devil in your dreams
I'm bigger than the universe, I'm infinite like human thirst
For water and like water from the glaciers I consume the Earth
They call me Lethal Clause and I'm the fastest in the world
I got your grandpa some golf clubs, your grandma some pearls
Baby now you know I got the rhymin' stamina
Kill you while you shittin' like you Tywin Lannister
I don't wanne have to go and damage your entire face
Peace I'm out back up the fire place!
