[Intro:]
Conflict-resolution and it's damn sure not specialty
I want to thank everyone for listening to the album that they just listen to
Please don't take out your lighters though it's kinda sad

[Verse 1:]
I'm from the meth-lab city of broken dreams and cracked out dope of means
Where everybody is lookin for an ocean scene
Where pac and biggie are pass'e
Cause back home we speak in terms of mac dre and fat tone
I'm from a city where there's actually people that
Are bother by the thought of homosexual marriage
The bible belt friendly smiles and christian steeples
And names like bobby sue jenkins and belinda peoples
This town is so erie when it snows all the trees look like
Ghost appearing from the road
The crows flew south of heaven and found the elixir
The echo of silence whisper from the mouth of the river
To say yah the city could be great one day but the first step
Is getting out of our own way
I've been to bigger cities they produce bigger frowns
All dying right here in this town

[Chorus: x2]
And I know there's something beautiful within my grasp
And I know I think I'm satisfy but it won't last
And I know to lace my boots up and pick my path
I'll find another rain storm to fill my glass

[Verse 2:]
To quote my life is written by anonymous fuck it
I think I'll keep the liquid courage and the broken promises
So if your comin' over bring the bottle and a cup
There's a war goin on outside and I don't give a fuck
I can never win the fight for me
I could only minimize the details of my life story
I was born late july 1981 skip a bunch
Bullshit until now and then stories done
But I'm a write the chapters later in my life
In a nursing home with a sweet lady for a wife
Both of us in wheel chairs we quietly hold hands
It's strange but one day I'm gonna be an old man
I hope to be happy on that day because
I finally stood up and moved the hell outta my own way
I need to move the hell outta my own way
(note to self) so do you

[Chorus: x4]
And I know there's something beautiful within my grasp
And I know I think I'm satisfy but it won't last
And I know to lace my boots up and pick my path
I'll find another rain storm to fill my glass

No no no
Don't get your lighters out this isn't ben harper
Thank you southern thank you opus and thank you kansas city
Goodnight
