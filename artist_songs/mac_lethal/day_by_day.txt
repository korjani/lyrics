Good morning sunshine
Get your bitch ass up and get ready for work
It's a new day
Ah, coffee time

I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna spend today up in the kingdom or prison
Listen, I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna base your choices off of wishes or wisdom
Let's go

Kan City legend, blue belt in jujitsu
All I need is marijuana, coffee and my rent due
And I'll be flowing so insane. Whoo!
You wanna see something sexy? Open up my brain. God damn!
Sexy like a March 1992 Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition centrefold with Kathy Ireland up on the top cover
Whipping up some peanut butter cookies with the pot butter
Used to steal UFC VHS tapes out of Blockbuster
Royce Gracie was a monster, sick
Triangle choke a motherfucker 'til his face turn bright-ass red like a lobster... dick
I'm from Kansas City, home of Jesus
And obese kids that eat way too many Reese's and drink too many energy drinks
The only way that I can fucking escape is to sit here and think

You know I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna spend today up in the kingdom or prison
Listen, I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna base your choices off of wishes or wisdom
Let's go

My name is Mac, I hate pop music
I love to sleep in all day and not do shit. Nap time, biatch!
I'm feeling so priceless, have a fucking existential crisis as I write this
Girl, why you acting like a stupid hoe?
The whole entire world is watching like the Truman Show
You never plant seeds, never have food to grow
All I want to do is read books and make stupid dough
Hoe please, that's the motif
I never put you on no leash, but I promise that I'll love you if you make a little salad with some walnuts and goat cheese
Pop a beer and yell "Go Chiefs!"
I used to take drugs to feel normal, now I feel high when I'm sober
Sometimes I think about my birth, sometimes I think about my death and all the time I wonder which one is closer
But it don't matter
Jameson whiskey up in my bladder
Spent fifteen years trying to be a rapper
Nobody paid attention 'til I started mixing pancake batter
Now they come to my shows like "Go faster"
Exercise, drink wine daily, make life sweet like a [?]
Drop down and get in to the modified Cobra
And shoutout to the flexible bitches that do yoga

I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna spend today up in the kingdom or prison
Listen, I'm trying to take it day by day
You see another rapper rhyming but he ain't like me
Man, it's a brand new day
It's time to make the decision
You gonna base your choices off of wishes or wisdom
Let's go!

Hi. I'm Hamilton. I'm aspargus, artichoke rising
Hi. I'm Lorace. My sign in spinach, it's the green pea rising
Hi. I'm Willie. (Oh really?) And I don't have a sign
