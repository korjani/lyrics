As the rain's coming down, well it soaks my shoes,
There's a path that I'm on, so keep dry,
Through the darkness, a glow that could reach everyone,

When I come here I don't feel so alone, it's all right, I'm solarised,
I'm just tryna carry on, with the life I made,
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there),

Hear the sound of the wind, it howls my name,
In the cold light of day, you can see it in my eyes they've changed,

When I come here I don't feel so alone, it's all right, it's solarised,
I'll just try to carry on, with the life I made,
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there),

When I'm up here I know who I am, it's all right, I'm solarised,
I'm just tryna carry on, with the life I made,
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there),
I said I know I'm gonna get there.
