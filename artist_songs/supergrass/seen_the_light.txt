Now that our eyes have seen the light
Well the world lies twisted and weird
It's like our minds have taken flight
pedelo rides up to the sun, oh yeah

Well, what you do is up to you
Take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band

Now that our eyes have seen the light
Well the road lies open and clear
It's like our minds have taken flight
Like the river runs down to the sea, oh yeah

Well, what you do is up to you
I'll take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band

Well, what you do is up to you
Take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band
Thank you very much
