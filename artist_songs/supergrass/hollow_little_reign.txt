Uptight, thinking things over,
Conversations running round my head,
Good times last so much longer
And summer loving going straight to my head
Some day when I can

Cool skies drinking the sunshine
Feel the wind blowing through my hair
It's our time, for talking it over
Take you home fall into my bed
Some day when I can

Sometimes, clouds will come over
Leopard spots in front of my eyes
One day when I feel a lot better
Take a train to a cooler climes
Some day when I can.
