Take my love away
It's never gonna work for you 

Well, he met her at night
You now that seeing is believing
I know the feeling was right
Well she couldn't stop screaming

And she swallowed it down
To the heart of the world
She's so loose 
She's so loose 

Take these wings away
They're never gonna work for me

Well he met her at night
You now that seeing is believing
I know the feeling was right
Well, she couldn't stop screaming

It's getting harder again
In the heart of the world

You know he met her at night
You now that seeing is believing
I know the feeling was right
Well, she couldn't stop screaming

And she swallowed it down
To the heart of the world
You know she's so loose
