Well we're [?] ruin of fables
As we drink ourselves right under the tables
Well you need an end to yesterday's papers
and tell us that they love us and hate us
[?]
Cos they're gonna kill us sooner or later
Yeah we really ran and ruined the fables
[?] climbing up the tower of [?]

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling

Well they meet in the ruin of fables
They see inside ourselves and what we are make of
Come along and stick on a label
We do the dance of the mashed potato
[?]
Cos they're superfragilistically-anus
[?] goddess of a city of angels

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
