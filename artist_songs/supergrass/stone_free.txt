Every day of the week I'm in [?]
But if I stay too long, people try to hold me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talk about the clothes I wear
They don't realize, they're the ones who're square
Yeah, that's right
You can't hold me down
I don't wanna be tied down
I wanna be free, yeah
I said stone free, do what I please
Stone free, ride on breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to, got to get away, oh yeah

A woman here, woman there
Keep me in a plastic case
They don't realize, it's so easy to break
Sometimes I feel my heart, I feel my heart kind of running wild
I swear I've got to move before life
Oh yeah, that's right
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I wanna be free, yeah
I said stone free, do what I please
Stone free, ride on breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to, got to get away, oh yeah

Stone free, do what I please
Stone free, ride on breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Stone free, got to, got to get away,
Stone free
Oh yes, stone free
Stone free, ride on breeze
Stone free
