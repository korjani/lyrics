The loneliness at times
I can feel it open wide
I can wander through the past
And believe it for a while

We were younger
Oh the way you turned my head, ooooh

The things we used to have
Are fading all too fast
Like a castle in the sand
Well some things they're meant to last

We were younger
Oh the way you turned my head, ooooh

I wonder if I'd care
If I saw you again
Would you hurt me like before
Or would happiness be there

We were younger
Oh the way you turned my head, ooooh
