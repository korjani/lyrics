Moving, just keep moving,
Till I don't know what's sane,
I've been moving so long,
The days all feel the same,

Moving, just keep moving,
Well I don't know why to stay,
No ties to bind me,
No reasons to remain,

Got a low, low feeling around me,
And a stone cold feeling inside,
And I just can't stop messing my mind up,
Or wasting my time,

There's a low, low feeling around me,
And a stone cold feeling inside,
I've got to find somebody to help me,
I keep you in mind,

So I'll keep moving, just keep moving,
Well I don't know who I am,
No need to follow,
There's no way back again,

Moving, keep on moving,
Where I feel I'm home again,
And when it's over,
I'll see you again,

Got a low, low feeling around me,
And a stone cold feeling inside,
And I just can't stop messing my mind up,
Or wasting my time,

There's a low, low feeling around me,
And a stone cold feeling inside,
I've got to find somebody to help me,
I keep you in mind.
