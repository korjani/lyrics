Going to a party and you'll never want to leave it tonight,
You'll wanna see the band playing bish bash bosh tonight
Yeah, I know its just a feeling but I know I'm going to see her tonight,
Yeah, and everybody knows they're never gonna get a sleep in tonight,
And she said "When?",
I said "Why, yeah, tonight",
Whoo hoo, whoo hoo, whoo hoo.

Going to a party and you'll never want to leave it tonight,
You'll wanna see the band playing bish bash bosh tonight
Yeah, I know its just a feeling that I know I'm going to see her tonight,
Yeah, and everybody knows you're gonna follow me around tonight,
And she said "When?",
I said "Why, tonight" I went dry,

And a gun in his hand,
And he's looking at mine,
And he's two foot two,
And its clear you don't know where I am, when you see what I've been through,
And he's phoning his cab,
When he's seemingly fine,
And he's seen me too,
It's clear he don't know what you are, when you see what I've been through,
She said "When?",
I said "Why, yeah, tonight",

Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!
Yeah Whoo hoo!

Tonight.

Yeah, she said "When?",
I said "Why, tonight" I went dry,
yeah, tonight.
