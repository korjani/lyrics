I know you're out there,
We saw a shooting star,
We don't know what you done,
You're near for a star

But now we know it,
We don't know who you are,
We don't know what you done,
You're near for a star

We're slowly fading,
Your glow is almost gone,
We don't know what you done,
You're near for a star
