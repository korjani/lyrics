Whatever you want, it's all right,
There's still a place in my heart, it's all right
There's something calm
You'll need no arms
You're over the moon, she said

You keep me warm
Some other fawn
You're over the moon, she said

Whatever you want, it's all right,
There's still a place in my heart, it's all right
Whatever you want, it's all right,
There's still a place in my heart, it's all right
