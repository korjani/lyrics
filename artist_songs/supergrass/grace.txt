Well, we jumped all night on your trampoline
When you kissed the sky it made your sister scream
You ate our chips and you drank our Coke
Then you showed me Mars through your telescope

Oh Grace 
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace 
Save your money for the children 
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money, girl

Well, you sang your songs and you made us laugh 
And so we captured you in a photograph
And when the stars came out, your mother called your name
But when the morning comes, we'll get together again

Oh Grace 
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace 
Save your money for the children 
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money, girl

Save your money
Save your money for the
Save your money for the children
You save your money for the children

Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on

Oh Grace 
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace 
Save your money, save your money, girl

Everybody there's lovin' a part in the game
