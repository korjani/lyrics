Jesus came from outta space and travelled from beyond the stars,
He came down for peace on Earth and left in a second-hand car,
The old men came to watch their sheep, lit their fire while the records played
Talked all night till they lost the plot, and they fell down the english way
fell down the english way

Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you,
Love'll talk, love'll walk, love'll speak out for you

Jesus came from outta space and travelled from beyond the stars,
He came down for peace on Earth and left in a second-hand car,
In the heavens with the planets in,
all the stars seem to look my way (look my way)
Been so long since I came unstuck,
now tryna make you feel that way (tryna make you feel that way)

Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you,
Love'll wide, love'll talk, love'll speak up for you
Love'll shake, love'll wake a way, love'll wake up with you
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you,

Come on brother have you lost your touch or have you gone and lost your way
A few hunters came to try their luck, but they died on the way to Bombay
Withered hands lay upon the rocks and raise your glass to the morning age
Next life's gonna be just fine,
so I'll see you on the other side, I'll meet you on the other side

Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you,
Love'll talk, love'll walk, love'll speak up for you
Love'll shake, love'll wake, love'll wake up with you
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you,
