If I told you something,
Would you make it disappear?
Will you know what I would say,
A broken heart it is sat here,

Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah

Yes I'm here, I'm alone again,
Everybody in my head...
Understand I just don't care,
Will you know what I would say,
You broke my mind but now I'm here,

Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah

Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way
Nothing More's Gonna Get In My Way, yeah
