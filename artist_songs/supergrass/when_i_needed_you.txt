Ever wondered how we all get through
Maybe someone's watching over you
All the shit that we face everyday
Somehow works itself out anyway

In the back of a stolen car
Doin' eighty with the headlights off
That's when I needed you

Ever wondered how we all get through
Maybe someone's watching over you
When the ground is falling fast beneath
You somehow find yourself back on your feet

In the middle of a shady bar
Broken bottles flying through the air
That's when I needed you

Out of my sorrows
Livin' out hollow steel
I look through old photos
For hours and hours

In the back of a stolen car
Doin' 80 with the headlights off
That's when I needed you

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
That's when I needed you
