I wandered for a while 
I didn't have that far to go 
Waiting for a letter
Only to discover that I'm not the same

I know it to be true
You're only gonna to go again
Standing at the harbour
There is only water to be talking to

I sold it to the trees
I didn't know which way to go
Underneath the harbour
Waiting for the sun to settle down

I own it to your dreams
They always seem to bring me 'round
Waiting at the harbour
There is only water to be talking to

Hold on now, all I wanna do is see you
But everybody's here just sitting round staring at the ceiling
What you gonna find in your mixed up minds when you're dreaming?
Could be we're not like you at all

Hold on now, all I wanna do is see you
But everybody's here just sitting round staring at the ceiling
Funny what you find in your mixed up mind when you're dreaming
Maybe we're not like you at all
