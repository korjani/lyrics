Wait a minute now you just can't run away
You got no money and you got no place to stay
Things are bad but there's always another way
How would you know if you never ever saw me?

Oh no, when I look at you I see
Why you looking so crazy?
Why you looking so lonely for love?

What do you wanna feel now?
Why you looking so crazy?
Why you looking so lonely for love?

What do you wanna see now?
Wait a minute, it's all wrong
Wait a minute, it's all gone wrong

Wait a minute now you just can't hide away
You got no money and you got no face to save
You think it's bad but there's always another way
How would you know if you never ever saw me?

Oh no, when I look at you I see
Why you looking so crazy?
Why you looking so lonely for love?

What do you wanna feel now?
Why you looking so crazy?
Why you looking so lonely for love?

What do you wanna see now? (oh yeah)
What do you wanna see? (oh yeah)
What do you wanna be? (oh yeah)
What do you wanna feel? (oh yeah)
