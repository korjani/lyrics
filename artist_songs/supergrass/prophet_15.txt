I'm lost in a cloud and I can't get out
There's no other way, don't try

I'm caught in a car and I can't get out
I can't explain, I can't drive
Can't drive

Oscar Wilde and Peter Cooke close by
Che Guevara and Steve McQueen, right there, oh yeah

I'm lost in a cloud and I can't get out
Floating away, can't fly

Caught in a car and I can't get out
I can't explain, can't drive
I can't drive

John Belushi, Lady Day close by
Joe the Lion and Marvyn Gaye, right there, oh yeah

And Davy Crocket and Joan Of Arc close by
And David Banner and Roger Moore they're all there, oh yeah
