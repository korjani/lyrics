White budding sun,
It's gonna come again,
Wait for the one,
She's bringing you her love,

But I may not know everyone,
Along the way,
And I may not see everyone,
Along the way,

Head for the hills,
They're never far away,
Look for the one,
She's coming for your love,

But I may not know everyone,
Along the way,
And I may not see everyone,
Along the way,

(Take it away, wolfman!)

But I may not know everyone,
Along the way,
And I may not see everyone,
Along the way,
And I may not know everyone,
Along the way,
And I may not see everyone,
Along the way.
