It's late in the day,
I'm thinking of you, 
The things that you say,
So long,
So long for me,

Its late in the day, 
I'm talking to you,
Hear what I say,
So long,
So long for me,

All the time I thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
All I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
Had thoughts of you and me again,

I lay on my bed,
Searching my mind,
Writing my love,
So long,
So long for me,

I sleep on the road,
Dream of a sound,
Coming my way,
So long,
So long for me,

All the time I thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
All I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
Had thoughts of you and me again,

All the time I thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
I close my eyes and turn away,

And all the time I've been with you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
And thoughts of you and me again
