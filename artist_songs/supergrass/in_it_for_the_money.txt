Here I see a time, to go and leave it all behind,
And you know it's wrong to fall,

We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,
We're in it for the money,

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home,
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home,

But all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her,
But all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her,

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home,
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home,

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home,
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home,

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home,
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home.
