When you look out at night, you are surrounded by people,
Cracked in the heat again, dead on their feet again, people,
Rings all around their eyes, flashing their whitest lies,
Taking their medicine, till they're all out of time, people, people,

What does it say to you when you can't face all those people
You could run out of friends faster than making them
Out on your own again, now you don't know how to feel, feel

When you're looking for reason and finding confusion
You're caught in the crossfire, learning to thrill,
Well there's gotta be some way out of the groove
Now you're caught in a maelstrom, spinning your laughter
Feeling your backbone turn into glue
And I wanna be so fine, people

When you look out at night, are you surrounded by people
Cracked in the heat again, dead on their feet again,
taking their medicine, till they're all out of time, people, people

When you're looking for reason and finding confusion
You're caught in the crossfire, learning to thrill,
Well there's gotta be some way out of the groove
Now you're caught in a maelstrom, spinning your laughter
Feeling your backbone turn into glue
And I wanna be so fine, people
people, people, people
