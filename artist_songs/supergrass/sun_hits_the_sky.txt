I know a place where the sun hits the sky,
Everything changes and blows out the night,
Everyone knows why my tongue can't be tied,
'Cause I want to live where the sun meets the sky,

I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way, you won't come down today,
Live for the right things, be with the right ones,
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world around,

Well, I just don't know why the sun hits the sky,
Everyone changed as they turned out the light,
Living is easy with time on my side,
'Cause I want to live where the sun meets the sky,

I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way, and you won't come down today,
Live for the right things, be with the right ones,
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world around,

I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way, and you won't come down today,
Live for the right things, be with the right ones,
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world around,
