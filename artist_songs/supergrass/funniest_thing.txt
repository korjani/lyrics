Broke on a summer night
Cracked in a room
Planet is over
And I can see it all
I can see it all, yeah

Was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
While the synergy flows through my brains
That is hard

Venus is growing
Immune to the laze
And in the shade of morphine
I forget it all
Just forget it all, yeah

Was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
And while the synergy flows through my brains
That is hard

Oh, was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
And while the synergy flows through my brains
Oh, here she goes

It's what I saw
That is hard
Darling that is hard
