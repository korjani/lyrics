I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now 
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you 
When I tell you I don't want you here 

I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now 
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you 
When I tell you I don't want you here

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now 
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you 
When I tell you, when I tell you
Oh now, when I tell you I don't want you here
