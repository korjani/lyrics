Melanie Davis stands all alone in her room,
Feeling unsteady 'cos when you're alone, you're alone,
Do you need someone, I need anyone,
Do you need someone, I need everyone,

Light up a fire, trying to come in from the cold,
When you're retired, needing a home from a home,
When you need someone, not just anyone,
Do you need someone, I need everyone, yeah everyone,
Do you need someone, I need anyone,
Do you need someone, I need everyone
