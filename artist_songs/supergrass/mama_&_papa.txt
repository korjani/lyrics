Walk in the park, and it's getting dark, and I don't wanna be alone,
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home,
Fly down the lane through the wind and the rain till the fires of the evening go,
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home,
Drift in time as the mountains rise from the floor of the valley below,
Seasons change as the rivers meet the sea,

Walk in the park, and it's getting dark, and I don't wanna be alone,
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home,
Tire of the trail as the daylight fails and the shadows of the east do grow,
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home,
Side by side in the countryside with no thought for getting home,
Distant stars are the only lights to see,

Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home.
