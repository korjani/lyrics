I drift out to sea,
Moving slowly away,
Alone on the breeze,
Put my sorrow to sleep,

But I know, yes I know, how to live,
A true love for me, is all that I need,
It's something I've always done wrong,

To sleep but not dream,
Is the way that I feel,
There's no-one for me,
On the bed of the sea,

But I know, yes I know, how to live,
A true love for me, is all that I need,
It's something I've always done wrong,

Oh but I know, yes I know, how to live,
A true love for me, is all that I need,
It's something I've always done wrong.
