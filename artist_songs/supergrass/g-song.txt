As I walk into the night,
I don't feel that my feet have touched the ground,
And I want to carry on,
But I can't see anyone who'd take the time,

There may be troubles, in your mind,
Maybe tomorrow, could be fine

I feel like going home,
But I don't know if I'm up or coming down,
And I feel there's something wrong,
But I know it's just the time it takes to climb,

There may be troubles in your mind,
Maybe tomorrow, you could be fine,

There may be troubles in your mind,
Maybe tomorrow, you could be fine.
