Got my sweet sweet love,
And my blistered feet,
In the easy heat,
Come away,

I was feeling fine,
I'm the waters friend,
I could stay here,
For the day,

We still need more than anyone can give,
We still have more, cos here it comes, here it comes,
There's a music show,
Hear the distant sound,
As the wild sun,
Meets the sky,

See the smoke rise up,
Through the heavenly clouds,
We're together,
For the day,

We still need more than anyone can give,
We still have more, cos here it comes, here it comes,

I feel so free,
In the easy heat,
As the sun falls,
From the sky,

I feel so right,
In the evening light,
I could stay here,
For the day.
