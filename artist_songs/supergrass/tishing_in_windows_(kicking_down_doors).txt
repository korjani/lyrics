Last night I was hammered
Feeling so unannounced
Cried standing in the subway
And general lying on the ground

Well I just want to be someone
Your kids [?]
Only goes to show that I'm numbered
So get your feet off my cloud

Tishing in windows
Kicking down doors
Picking on children
Drinking in bars
I've got a terrible problem

I never said I was sweetness
In case you feel left out
And if you want I'll be heavy
And blow your cobwebs out
I don't wanna be someone
Who puts the effort for
Only goes to show you live on
Is gonna take you down

Tishing in windows
Kicking down doors
Picking on children
Drinking in bars
I've got a terrible problem

Tishing in windows
Kicking down doors
Picking on children
Drinking in bars
I've got a terrible problem
