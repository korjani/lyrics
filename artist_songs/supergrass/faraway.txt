Yesterday seems faraway and I can see it true
I don't believe you're leaving me with nothing on the tube
Operating slowly as the air is growing thin
Wake me up each morning don't forget to plug me in
Have you seen me lately I'm as happy as a loon
Wait until your ship comes in and pasturise your crew

Cos I don't believe in a life that I can't feel
And I don't believe in a life that I can't feel

Constellations overhead shine lightly down on you
Their influences unrelated to your present mood
And I can see you're on your own although your heart is true
So come in cos your card is up your time is overdue

Cos I don't believe in a life that I can't feel
And I don't believe in a life that I can't feel

I've made up my mind, the fire is lit,
I had to find my bed, I'd better lie on it
But what does it matter I'm lost in space
I'm just another loser in the human race
You're forcing my hand to make it plain
I'm not very happy and I cannot explain
Well I can feel better, well looking the part
I have to find a way to stay true to my heart
I love my girl and she loves me
I won't find another who can sail my sea
She's in my head and on my mind
I'm off my rocker with a girl so divine
Well here's the hour, and where will it end
I can't buy a T-shirt to impress all my friends
I'm trying my hardest, I'm tryna fit in
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin, yes yes
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin (I don't believe)
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin (that I can't feel)
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin (I don't believe)
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin (that I can't feel)
I'll make a new start, I don't know where to begin
