Don't lose it, don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

And don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

Won't you say my name?

So don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

And don't lose it, no don't lose it,
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

Did you call my name?

I don't want anybody
Anyway, I know too much to say
All over again

So don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

Did you call my name?
