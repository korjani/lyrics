From the ice-age to the dole-age there is but one concern,
That I have just discovered some girls are bigger than others,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers,

As Anthony said to Cleopatra, as he opened a crate of ale,
Oh, I say, some girls are bigger than others,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girls are bigger than others,
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers,
The light on your pillow,
The one that you dream of,

The light on your pillow,
The one that you dream of,
And I said you're mine.
