What went wrong in your head?
While we slept in our beds,
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

What went wrong in your head?
We played along with what you said,
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
What went wrong in your head?

God save the unstable, they stand alone,
Ain't done no wrong, it's such a beautiful life,
I'll need some salvation, wave you on,
Ain't done no harm, with a wonderful life,
