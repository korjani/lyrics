I can see a long way down
Heaven had the time to grow
Heaven had the time to grow

Now the fire's burned down low
Lying in the afterglow
Living in your afterglow

I can make it right for you
Even if you had to go
Even if you had to go

I can walk away from you
Only if you want me to
Tell me that you want me to

Even if you had to run
Even if you had to run
