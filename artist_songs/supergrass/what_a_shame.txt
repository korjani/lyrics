The city I love,
The city in the night.
Looks like all I ever really need is out there.

If it's not love
Then it's in vein.
Seems I never really know until I get there.

Oh what a shame, you don't really need me anymore.
Oh what a shame, you don't really love me anymore.
Glad I came.
Lord, I could cheer.
Drop me feather, can't you tell me that she got one.

Sing my song,
Play ain't long.
We'll sit back and tell the others how we got here.
Oh what a shame, you don't really love me anymore.
Oh what a shame, you don't really need me anymore.

City of love,
City of pain.
It's so hard to get a feeling you belong here.
I saw her face,
Looking at her ass.
Looks like all I ever really need is right here.
Oh what a shame you don't really need me anymore.
What a shame you don't really love me anymore.

Oh what a shame, you don't really need me anymore.
Oh what a shame, you don't really love me anymore.
It's such a shame, you don't really need me anymore.
What a shame, you don't really love me anymore
