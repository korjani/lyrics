If you like me, you can buy me, and take me home,
When you see me, on your TV, I'm alone,
You can call me, tell your story, on the phone,
You can hear me, over blue seas, I'm alone,

You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,
You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,

When you need me, come and see me, and take me out,
In the evening, when we're sleepy, lay me down,
All the crazies, try to space me, and I don't know,
I'm not easy, don't try to please me, xenophobe,

You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,
You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,

If you like me, you can buy me, and take me home,
When you see me, on your TV, I'm alone,
You can call me, tell your story, on the phone,
You can hear me, over blue seas, I'm alone,

You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,
You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,
You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me,
You can't see me, I'm not really there,
You can't see me.
