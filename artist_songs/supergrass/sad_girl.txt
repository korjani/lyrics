Honey found time costs
You never learnt to economise
You look around and before you know
It's gone, turned to dust

There she goes
Plays the part of sorrow
In the garden running free
Steady nerves, taking all the hard knocks
You've only got yourself
Falling out of love
Making other plans

Lady knows how to go
Making eyes in a photograph
But we all know you're a lonely girl
All sad and lost

There she goes
Walking out the front door
You've only got yourself in deep
Daily life driven to a cold heart
The only god you know is greed

People in my head it goes
Break up the band
Man overboard
See Hollywood
Run out of cash
Get out of bed
Call off the dogs
Take out the trash
Stare at the sun
Man on the tracks
Cat out the bag
Sit on the fence
You got blood on your hands
Run out of luck
Lay down your arms
Curled on your bed
And then do it all again

Are times so lost
You wear the look of a modern girl
You wander round like a loaded gun
Armed for the cause

There she goes
Walking out the front door
You've only got yourself in deep
Lord knows I closed your eyes for so long
You're in the garden running free
