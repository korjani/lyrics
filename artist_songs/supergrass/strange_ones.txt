There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know 
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below 

Well I would cry for you
I would die for you
Everybody needs a home

Well are you strange enough?
Are you deranged enough?
Every fucker needs a home

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below

Well I would feel for you
I would steal for you
Everybody needs a home

Well are you strange enough? 
Are you deranged enough? 
Every fucker needs a home 

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know 
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know 
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below
