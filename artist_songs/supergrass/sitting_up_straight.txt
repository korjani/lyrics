Sitting up straight on the back of a bus
Mimiking time as evening turns to dusk
Oh, look at the boy with his face on the floor
So I have a little smoke to pass the time of day
Oh yeah, oh yeah

He's like me, he would do anything to get away
I know, can you believe it everyday
I know I can't believe in you
It means everything and every pound of me
