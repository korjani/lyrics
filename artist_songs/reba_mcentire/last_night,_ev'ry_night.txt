I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes and try to hide them from the morning sun
I whisper how ya doing and you smile and say so tenderly good morning hun

Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, ev'ry night

I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis
And you mentioned it's an early flight
You start to pack
And while I comb my hair
I stare at you and think about last night

Cause last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, ev'ry night

I slip into my robe to go make coffee
You come in and pull me close to you
And as I feel your tender kiss
I whisper can't Memphis wait a day or two
Cause last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, ev'ry night

Cause last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, ev'ry night
