You come to me just as a friend
Cause you're looking for someone's shoulder you can cry on
Well she broke your heart
Now it's the end
And you say that you've got an aching heart
Like the world has never known

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you

You say I may not understand
How it feels to see your love in the arms of another
But you don't know the many times
That I had to hide all my tears inside
When I saw you with your lover

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you

When you don't even know about the love that I feel for you

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you
