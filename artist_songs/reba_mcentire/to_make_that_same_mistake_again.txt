Of all the broken hearts I've had
This one hurts the worst
His love flowed like a river
Now I'm dying of thirst
If loving him too much is why
I lost him in the end
Then I hope I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again

Well they say that love can be so strong that it's the choking kind
I never thought I'd see the day when love would be a crime
Mistakes can cost a lot and it
Sometimes we lose to win
Oh I hope I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again

Oh I may go crazy missing him
Knowing that it's my fault
But how could I have loved him less
Oh I tremble at the thought
And it's amazing how I'm holding on
With the shape I'm in
Oh I hope that I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again
