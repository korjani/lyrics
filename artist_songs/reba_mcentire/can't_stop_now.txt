I can't say I didn't know what I was doing
I can't pretend things just got out of hand
I should of kept my distance
While I was still strong
But I got caught up in the feeling
Carrying along
But it's too late baby
I can't stop now

Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open
But I was blind when you told me you'd be mine
Just as soon as you were free
I should have slowed down
Before push came to shove
But I was already falling
Now too deep in love
And it's too late baby
I can't stop now

Can't stop now
Crazy heart running out of control
Can't stop now
I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road
I might be heading for a breakdown
But I can't stop now

Well I'm sitting here wondering
How I ever let myself fall
I keep hearing promises
But nothing seems to change it all
The love we made
Has got a life of it's own
It'll keep on going long after you're gone
Now it's too late baby
Can't stop now

Can't stop now
Crazy heart running out of control
Can't stop now
I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road
I might be heading for a breakdown
But I can't stop now

I might be heading for a breakdown
But I can't stop now
I might be heading for a breakdown
But I can't stop now
