The lights of Laredo dance on the water and shine in a young man's eyes.
Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise.
He's heard crazy stories of how people live over in the promised land.
He heard they eat three meals a day, just across the Rio Grande.
He's got a wife named Maria, and a baby named Rose, and another one to feed on the way.
Two willing hands, that couldn't find work today.
He stares at the river and curses the future, that he can't understand.
He knows the child would have a chance, just across the Rio Grande.

It's only a river, that's not so deep or wide.
A boy can throw a stone across and reach the other side.
It's just some muddy water, cutting through the land.
But a man can make a dream come true just across the Rio Grande.

Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise.
He's heard crazy stories of how good life is over in the promised land,
and sometimes it seems like God must live just across the Rio Grande.
