Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching

Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home

O for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home! '

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home! '
Calling, 'O sinner, come home! '
Come home!
