Don't tell me that time will ease the pain
Don't tell me the sunshines after the rain
Don't sit there and tell me
I'll love again someday
Whose heartache is this anyway

Don't say that all things happen
For the best
And don't talk of silver linings
Don't tell me I'll forget
Don't say don't you worry
Cause everything will be OK
Whose heartache is this anyway

Cause I'm not in the mood for sympathy
At least not from the one who's leaving me
So don't try to make it easy
Don't search for words to say
Whose heartache is this anyway

Well you say that'll always care for me
That I'll always be special
Well that's not what I need
So why don't you just go now
You've done enough today
And whose heartache is this anyway

Cause I'm not in the mood for sympathy
At least not from the one who's leaving me
So don't try to make it easy
Don't search for words to say
Whose heartache is this anyway

Why don't you just go now
You've done enough today
And whose heartache is this anyway
