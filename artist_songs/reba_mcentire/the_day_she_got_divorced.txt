She got up and put her makeup on
Made a pot of coffee extra strong
At the kitchen table sucking on a cigarette

Read the paper in a cloud of smoke
While the dirty dinner dishes soaked
Woke up the kids and coaxed them out of bed

Then she burnt the toast just like the day before
The day she got divorced
Story continues below

Left the kids with the girl next door
Parked her car at the county court
Round and round 'bout the child support he'll never pay

Judge said we're gonna have to start
Without the party of the second part
Cause the party of the second part was MIA

He was getting drunk just like the day before
The day she got divorced

Didn't feel any different than it ever had
She wasn't that sorry, wasn't that sad
Couldn't love him any less or hate him anymore
The day she got divorced

Wasn't working, had the whole day off
Bought a bottle then she called her boss
Waited for him at the motel lot til he got there

First he told her that her hair looked nice
Promised he was gonna leave his wife
Had two more lines but she didn't care

Cause it was just like every other day before
The day she got divorced

Didn't feel any different than it ever had
She wasn't that sorry, wasn't that sad
Couldn't love him any less or hate him anymore
The day she got divorced

Kids are yakking with their hungry mouths
Dog scratching laying on the couch
Think she really oughta clean this house, but what the hell

Cause it's just as dirty as the day before

Yeah, she's divorced
