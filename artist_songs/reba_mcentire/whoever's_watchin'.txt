I'm not wasting my time on earthly longing
Let that glory leave me be
I'm just tasting my life story
Just a page in history

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Well I'm not hurting like I used to
I got lucky can't you see
Love came searching
It could choose you
Love's the greatest victory

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

I always look to the sky
And held my head high
Had to be what I had to be
Till the day that I die
Yes I wonder why
Somebody's watching
Watching over me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Well if you know me
You know I've squandered
Everything that's dear to me
Still I stand here in total wonder
How it's all come back to me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
