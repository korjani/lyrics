So you like Sunday picnics
And yelling at the umpire at a baseball game
Window shopping, popcorn popping
Wading through the puddle in a summer rain
And I'll bet you're kind to children and
Someday you'd like to be a mother too
And do you got a feeling when you're with me the way I do

Well that makes two of us
We're like birds of a feather
True love brings together
A precious few of us
That makes two of us

So you believe in wishes
While blowing out the candles on a birthday cake
Gentle hugs and lightning bugs
Staying up all night to watch the morning break
We've got so much in common
Given half a chance I'm sure you'll agree
One way to sum up forever is you and me

Well that makes two of us
We're like birds of a feather
True love brings together
A precious few of us
That makes two of us
