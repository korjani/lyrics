I thought love was meant to last forever
Isn't that how love's supposed to be
Now it seems the good times are all over
It's so funny I guess the joke's on me

Every day I sit alone and wonder
Why I fell in love so easily
And then woke up to find that all he left behind
Are tattered dreams and broken pieces in my memory

So tell me what's so good about goodbye
What's so good about watching good love die
He's the kind you can't forget
So I won't even try
Tell me what's so good
I gave him all I could
Tell me what's so good about goodbye

I don't think I'll ever love another
I didn't know that goodbye could hurt so bad
I know I'll always find he's somewhere in my mind
Still believe the worst of him's the best I'll ever have

So tell me what's so good about goodbye
What's so good about watching good love die
He's the kind you can't forget
So I won't even try
Tell me what's so good
I gave him all I could
Tell me what's so good about goodbye
