I know that you've seen love walk out the door once or twice.
I know that you've seen it all, waiting by the telephone, you didn't get the call.
Well baby let me tell ya, you're looking at me with suspicious eyes, but they'll never be confirmed.

If there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.
Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why.
If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.

No time for doubts, I'm gonna turn your heart around.
Think about you everyday.
Gonna make you understand my love is here to stay.
We've got something going that's so hard to find.
You are the one, the only one that's on my mind.

If there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.
Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.
And I'm telling you the truth, and now I'll tell ya why.

If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.
Oh, if there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.
Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why.
If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.
