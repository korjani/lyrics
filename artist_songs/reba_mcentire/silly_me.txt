Funny how love comes and goes
With the tears that fill my life does it show
So listen to my heart beat once again
Because of you I hope this feeling never ends

Silly me
I fell in love again
We started out as friends
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before
Foolish me
Should I have closed the door
Promised, even swore to never love this way
Oh foolish me

They say that love's a chance you take
You know I've had my share
But when the nights get oh so cold I need you there
They say that love's a chance you take

Foolish me
