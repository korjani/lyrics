Sweet Dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you
And start my life new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me
It's plain
I should have known
I'd never wear your ring
I should hate you
The whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Why can't I forget the past
And start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
