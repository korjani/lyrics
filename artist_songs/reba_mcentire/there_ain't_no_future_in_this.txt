Honey I know you tried
When you loved me tonight
But the memory slipped from your lips
So if she's on your mind
That much of the time
There ain't no future in this

There was somebody who
Took a whole lot of you
And I guess you're not over it yet
If I'm just
Standing in for a memory then
There ain't no future in this

Cause mine are the arms that hold you
Hers are the arms you miss
So if she's still the one
When it's all said and done
There ain't no future in this

So if she's still the one
When it's all said and done
There ain't no future in this
