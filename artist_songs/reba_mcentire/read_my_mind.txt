A penny for my thoughts you say
You want to know what I could be thinking
But as I speak the music starts to play
And the words just somehow slip away

Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind, read my mind

One look from you and one look at me
I'm trembling like a little girl
I tell myself if I can just believe
Any day now you'll fall in love with me

Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind, read my mind

Tell me if you feel the same way I do
And tell me that I'm not mistakenly taken with you

You're all I ever wanted in a man
You see, all I need is everything you are to me
If you could somehow read my mind
You would see what I can't seem to say
If only you could, if you would read my mind
Read my mind
