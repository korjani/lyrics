I overheard a conversation your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard

Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you

This town's so small a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears but I see it in your eyes
The stories goin' 'round this town aren't lies

Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you

Whoa....rumor has it she loves you...
