She held him close, then she kissed his face
He said it just has to be this way
Yours is the heart I'll always keep
I'm not gone even if I leave

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn sun
Just like them horses
When it's time to run

He said, Chockie Mountain is calling me
Gonna take a walk up where I can see
Turn and face that western wind
Oh, and I'll be home again

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn sun
Just like them horses
When it's time to run

Oh, just like them horses

She held his hand, he took one last breath
Then she walked out to the front porch step
Stared at the sky, tears on her face
And she swore she could hear him say

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn sun
Just like them horses
When it's time to run

Just like them horses
When it's time to run
When it's time to run
When it's time to run

Now it's time to run

Just like them horses, ooh
Just like them horses
Oh, now it's time to run...
