Rain Fallin,Fallin Rain
It's a long and troubled night
A night when I wish I could sleep
But there's no sleep inside

Heart Breaking, Breaking heart
It's such a lonely sound
That cries for the need of someone
But there's no one around

Nobody here to hold
No one to warm the cold
That lies deep within my soul
All around, just the sound of the
Rain Falling, Fallin Rain
Like gentle tears of pain
That comes with my only friend
It's the gently falling rain

Nobody here to hold
No one to warm the cold
That lies deep within my soul
All around, just the sound of the
Rain Falling, Fallin Rain
Like gentle tears of pain
That comes with my only friend
It's the gently falling rain
