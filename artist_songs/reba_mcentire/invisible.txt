They met at a party.
He was laughing with his friends.
She captured all of his attention.
Just by walkin' in.
Confident and self-assured he liked her attitude.
And the moment their eyes met.
Every girl in the room became...

Invisible just out of view.
Invisible.
Like a pane of glass he could see right through.
Invisible.

They married in October.
She made a beautiful bride.
His world revolved around her.
They had a picture perfect life.
But when the baby came in August.
Time started spinning like a wheel.
She expected to feel tired.
But she never thought she'd feel...

Invisible just out of view.
Invisible.
Like a pane of glass he could see right through.
Invisible.

'Cause lately he's been overlooking quite a lot.
So tonight in lace and candlelight.
She'll prove to him she's not...

Invisible just out of view.
Invisible.
Like a pane of glass he could see right through.
Invisible.

A love deep inside.
Invisible.
So much more to her than meets the eye.
Invisible.
