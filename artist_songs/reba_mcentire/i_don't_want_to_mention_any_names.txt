I've got a story to tell, would you mind listening.
I can always count on you we're such good friends.
And I need to talk about my situation and you're the only one who'll understand.
Now someone's got designs on my baby.
She's making her intentions very plain.
We both know this ole gal that I'm talking about, but I don't want to mention any names.

Well she's asked him to slow dance way too often.
She's made suggestions I don't like at all.
I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game, but I don't wanna mention any names.

Well I can understand why she'd want him.
Oh you've even said yourself he's quite a prize.
She's about a good of friend as you are.
Come to think about it she's just about your size.
If she don't back off there's gonna be some trouble.
I'm prepared to make that very plain.
I sure hope I've said enough, and just between the two of us.
Cause I don't wanna mention any names.
