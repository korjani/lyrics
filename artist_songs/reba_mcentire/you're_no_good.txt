Feelin' better
Now that we're through
Feelin' better
'Cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson
It left a scar
But now I see
How you really are

You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good

Broke a heart
Gentle and true
Left a man
Over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness
On bended knee
But I wouldn't blame him
If he said to me

You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good

I'm tellin' you now baby
That I'm going my way
Forget about you baby
'Cause I'm leaving today
