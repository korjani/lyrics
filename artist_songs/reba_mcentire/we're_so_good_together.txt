How do two people like
To meet
I think about that
Was the timing just right
Was it that the night was so sweet
I think about that
Was it physical, chemical, what was the deal
Or did some kind of magic turn out to be real

Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walkin', honey, underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on getting better
We haven't even talked about forever
I just know that we're so good together
When did we cross that line
And just happen to find we're in love
I think about that
Was it you, was it me
Who could see we'd turn out to be us
I think about that
We could spend all our time trying to figure it out
And not be any closer than we are right now
