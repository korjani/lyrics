I'll never forget that night long ago
When he drove me down that old dusty road
He took me as far as I'd ever been
He wanted me and I wanted him
But I'd always been told I shouldn't give in

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

He was so patient, he didn't give up
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love
He asked me for forever, I asked him to wait
To please understand these dreams I must chase
Though it was a promise I wanted to make

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

After all these years. I saw him again
He had his wife and his family with him
He said he was proud of all my success
He guessed both of us had found happiness

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

Yes, I knew he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far
