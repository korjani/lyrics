On a cool gray morning, I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start fallin' after all this time

How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away

Shouldn't I start living my life for myself
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else
Oh why should it be his touch I feel in the dark
And will his voice always echo through my heart

How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away
