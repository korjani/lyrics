Aren't you tired of looking
For love you never find
Aren't you tired of playing games

With 20/20 vision
How is your heart so blind
It's all you wanted love to be
Is close enough for you to see

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you

I'm standing here just hoping
You're gonna look my way
But you're too busy chasing dreams to see

But when the dreams are faded
There's gonna come a day
That I can give you sweet, sweet love
And all the things you're dreaming of

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you
