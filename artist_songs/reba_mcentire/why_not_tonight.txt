Well pardon me but you have my attention
Ever since you strolled into the room
Believe me that it's not my intention
If I appear to come on too smooth

It's not like me to make such advances
But this time baby I could not resist
So if you're up for taking a chance on love
I can't see a better time than this

So baby why not tonight
This could be the start of something right
Hey you can take it easy
We can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go
So baby why not tonight
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh it's a perfect night for falling in love
So why not fall in love with me

Oh maybe we could go out for some dinner
And later on how we could do the town
Ya know I consider myself a winner
Just to have a boy like you around

Then if you're up for doing some dancing
Yeah I know a place they dance until the dawn
Anything you like will be alright
So why not take a chance and come along

So baby why not tonight
This could be the start of something right
Hey you can take it easy
We can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go
So baby why not tonight
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh it's a perfect night for falling in love
So why not fall in love with me
Why not fall in love, why not fall in love, baby why not fall in love with me
