Everybody's callin' it a real big shame
She keeps lettin' him treat her that way
He's older and he's wild
She's such a pretty child
He must be thinkin' 'bout one thing
But there are stars in her eyes
'Cause she's thinkin' he might
Give her that class ring

She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love

Daddy knows his baby's headed for a heartache
And that part of growin' up is learnin' from mistakes
But he can't let her go
Cause he knows
That boy's nothing but bad news
But Daddy can't control her
She's getting older
There's nothin' anyone can do

She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love

She might get hurt along the way
But she's gonna find true love someday

She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love

She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
