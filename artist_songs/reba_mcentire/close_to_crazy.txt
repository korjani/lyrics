I still reach for you
In the middle of my dreams each night
But my arms come up empty every time
And lately I talk to your memory
More than I should
If I could just forget the past I would
Cause this missing you ain't doing me no good

I'm so close to crazy
Right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane
But I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind
I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy
Is far from over you

This afternoon I caught myself
Reliving how it used to be
At a table for two just you and me
But talking to an empty chair
And laughing right out loud
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt
I'm a broken soul whose close to breaking down

I'm so close to crazy
Right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane
But I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind
I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy
Is far from over you

I still reach for you
In the middle of my dreams each night
