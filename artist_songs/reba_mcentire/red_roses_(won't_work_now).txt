Red roses just won't work now
Here we go us again
You've been gone and here you stand
With a dozen I'm sorry's in your hand

Victim of your podent charms
I took you back with open arms
But along with the roses came the thorns

And that's why red roses just won't work now
Cause you've done too much
To talk things out
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt
Red roses just won't work now

Gone for good's the trust I had
You let me done the garden path
Just too many times to take you back
So faith is why don't you
Save the roses for you know who
I already know how long they'll last

And that's why red roses just won't work now
Cause you've done too much
To talk things out
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt
Red roses just won't work now
