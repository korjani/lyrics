You tell me that you're always gonna love me
But that's what he said
That's what he said

And forever is a word
That should mean something
But that's what he said
That's what he said

You're telling me the same sweet things he told me
And in your eyes I see that same sweet glow
And did you say you'd never leave me lonely
Well that's what he said
That's what he said

You're telling me I've got to go on living
To open up my heart and just let go
And it's better to love and lose
Then live with nothing
But that's what he said
That's what he said

That's what he said
That's what he said
