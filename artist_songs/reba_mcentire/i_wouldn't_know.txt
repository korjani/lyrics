Everyone I see these days still asks me about you.
I guess they got so used to us together
they assume that everything's ok and then I have to say...

I wouldn't know. I haven't seen him.
I couldn't say it's been awhile.
I haven't thought about him lately.
So I wouldn't know.
I'm getting tired of people askin'.
Why can't they just leave me alone.
I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know.

I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds.
'Cause some old friend is bound to ask me
Why you're not around.
Well I just stay away so I don't have to say...
