Let me try to explain
It's not the roses or champagne
That really touch my heart
How can I make you see
That you're the best at loving me
When you don't know you are

Baby it's the way that you reach out while you're sleepin'
And gently hold my hand the whole night through
It's how you listen when I'm pouring out my feelings
Baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to

You don't need to rehearse
Some sweet romantic words
To whisper in my ear
So just forget the poetry
What comes naturally
Is what I long to hear

Baby it's the way that you reach out while you're sleepin'
And gently hold my hand the whole night through
It's how you listen when I'm pouring out my feelings
Baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to

It's in your eyes
And in your smile
In the passion of your kiss
It's takin' me in your arms so easily
So easily

It's how you listen when I'm pourin' out my feelings
Baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to
