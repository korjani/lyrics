Love is a powerful word
A little word that oughta mean something
Love better mean what it says
Say what you mean or it doesn't mean nothing
Love is a dangerous door to open
If you don't feel it when it's spoken

Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it
Just to throw away a promise I knew wasn't true
It meant a little less to me everytime I did it
But I never said I love you from the heart
Til I said it to you

You made me tell you the truth
And that truth was a total revelation
I see I have it in me
Now I can speak without any hesitation
I love you comes so freely
For the first time I believe me

Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it
Just to throw away a promise I knew wasn't true
It meant a little less to me everytime I did it
But I never said I love you from the heart
Til I said it to you

Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it
Just to throw away a promise I knew wasn't true
It meant a little less to me everytime I did it
But I never said I love you from the heart
Til I said it to you
