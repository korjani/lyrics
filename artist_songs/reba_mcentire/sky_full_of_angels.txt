Preacher man talking about the end of time
Well, Lord knows I'm ready, it don't worry my mind
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me

You can take my possessions
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul

Walk through darkness
I don't need no light
My faith in Jesus gonna be my guide
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of of angels watching over me

You can take me for granted
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul

River's rising but I got no doubt
My sweet Savior's gonna pull me out
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me

You can take my possessions
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul

I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me

I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me
