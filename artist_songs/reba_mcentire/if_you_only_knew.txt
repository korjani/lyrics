So here you are again
Standing at my door
You know I'd understand
Well that's what friends are for

What's he done this time
What did he say
To make you so darn mad
That you're running away
Now you say you want to be like me
Independent and free

But if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonley nights
The empty I love yous
Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home

My life looks good to you
I'm always in control
No one to answer to
But no one there to hold
You see in my eyes you are the lucky one
With loving arms that you can lean upon
I'd give anything I could to say
What you're throwing away

Cause if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonley nights
The empty I love yous
Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home

I know it's hard to face that love ain't perfect everyday
But I know a hundred girls who would gladly take your place

So if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonley nights
The empty I love yous
Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home

You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home
If you only knew
