When you ain't got nobody, then nobody ever says goodbye
You don't have to wait for someone to make you laugh or make you cry
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you
I sleep in a bed so empty, it's an emptiness no one can fill.

I may have to go on living, but life without you ain't no thrill
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you

Well whoever said it's better to love and to lose
Well he ought to be right here in my shoes
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe
I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you
