You know I can't find the letters you wrote to me in school.
And that shoebox full of photographs got lost in my last move.
I gave away that old twin bed where you and I first laid.
But after all this time, I've still got the love we made.
And that old beat up car we dated in, finally turned to rust.
And the first rose that you gave me, oh it finally turned to dust.
But all those tender nights we shared are never gonna fade.
Cause after all this time I've still got the love we made.
I've got every feeling we felt when touched.
Cause even though fell apart I kept a part of us.
I've held on to everytime we held each other tight,
And promised that no matter what we'd never say goodbye.
I don't have one souvenier of us I'd meant to save,
But right here in my heart I've still got the love we made.
Ooh right here in my heart I've still got the love we made.
