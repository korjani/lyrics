People love to talk
And Lord I've heard it all
A rumor's not a stranger in this town
Now me, I pay no mind
But it's hittin' home this time
Now I've been told you've gone and let me down

I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you

They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hude
I think that you owe me
Just a little honesty
And even though you told me with your eyes

I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you
