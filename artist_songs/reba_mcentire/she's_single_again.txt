I just got to tell you what I saw last night
I wish I was guessing but I know that I'm right
She walked in the place with a smile on her face
And I wondered why she was alone

Every man watched her as she swayed on by
The way she was looking every woman could cry
Then I saw her sit down with a lawyer
And I knew what was going on

She's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend
She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Is this number 4
Is this number 5
How many husbands has she buried alive
She uses the favors that the good Lord gave her
With the devil's desire

Well I bet she's thinking
She's on top of the world
And I've seen her working
So I'm warning you girls
She's single again
She's got a way with men
But she better get away from mine

'Cause she's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend
She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Yeah she's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again
