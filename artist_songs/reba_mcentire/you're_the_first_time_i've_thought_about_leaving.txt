I've seen you smile more than I thought you would
And I smiled back a little more than I should
And lately at night while he's sound asleep
I'm thinking things that I shouldn't think

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never done known someone like you

Sometimes I wait when I really should go
Lord only knows what I do that for
When I get home and he holds me close
I try not to think what I'm thinking most

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never done known someone like you

I've never known someone like you
