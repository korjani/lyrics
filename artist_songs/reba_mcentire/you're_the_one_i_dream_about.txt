I caught you smiling at me again out of the corner of my eye
It isn't easy when I have to pretend that you're just another guy
I can't let anyone ever know
I can't let my feelings show

'Cause you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

Whenever you are close to me my heart just won't be still
I hope that no one else can see the way you make me feel
If only I didn't have to hide all this loving I hold inside

'Cause you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight If we could somehow be together,

I know this love of ours would last forever.
So you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight
