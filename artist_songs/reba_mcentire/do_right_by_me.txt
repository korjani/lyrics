Sometimes you treat me so cruel I don't think I can take it
Sometimes you hurt me so bad, I just wanna die
But in a moment like this
With a tender touch and a lover's kiss
You put all of my pain aside and I say to you with my eyes

Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong

It feels so good to be so close like we were when we started
Oooh back when the troubles were few and the loving was blind
Funny how people so close
Know the things to say that can hurt the most
Baby why can't we just be kind and capture this moment in time

Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong

Do Right (Do right)
By Me (By Me)
Hmmmm Baby, baby, baby
Do Right (Do right)
By Me (By Me) oooh (Do right)
Baby, baby, (By Me ) baby
Do right (Do right)
By Me (By Me) (Do right)
Oooohhh (Do right) oooh (By me)
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong
