One to one
You and me
Anyone with eyes can plainly see
How it is with you and me

One to one
From now on
In each other's arms where we belong
And how we love when we're alone

We have so much between us
We know each other's needs
And you make it oh so good
When it's just you and me

One to one
You and me
Anyone with eyes can plainly see
Oh how it is with you and me

One to one
From now on
In each other's arms where we belong
Oh how we love when we're alone

One to One
