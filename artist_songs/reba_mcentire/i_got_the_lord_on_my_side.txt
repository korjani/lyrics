I'm so happy I got the Lord on my side
I'm so happy I got the Lord on my side
If you see this big ol' happy grinnin' smile on my face
That's 'cause I'm happy I got the Lord on my side
Oh I'm smilin' I got the Lord on my side
Yeah I'm smilin' I got the Lord on my side
When you see this big ol' happy grinnin' smile on my face
You know I'm smilin' I got the Lord on my side

Stomp if you're happy
Clap if you're happy
Sing if you're happy
I got the Lord on my side
Stomp if you're happy
Clap if you're happy
Sing if you're happy
I got the Lord on my side

I'm so happy I got the Lord on my side
If you see this big ol' happy grinnin' smile on my face
That's 'cause I'm happy I got the Lord on my side

Stomp if you're happy
Clap if you're happy
Sing if you're happy
I got the Lord on my side
Stomp if you're happy
Clap if you're happy
Sing if you're happy

If you're happy you got the Lord on your side
If you're happy you got the Lord on your side
If I see that big ol' happy grinnin' smile on your face
I know you're happy you got the Lord on your side
Oh you're smilin' you got the Lord on your side
Yes you're smilin' you got the Lord on your side
When I see that big ol' happy grinnin' smile on your face
I know you're smilin' you got the Lord on your side
