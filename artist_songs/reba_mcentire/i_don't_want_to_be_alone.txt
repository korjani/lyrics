My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.
Wish that I could be so bold as to walk right up to you and say what I think.
I don't now what you think of me.
And I know everyone can see I'm crazy about you and always will be.
Where's women's lib when you need it the most.
Or what is mama who said you're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that as to no in between.
Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid, it's just that the last move I made
Embarrased me to death and made me want to hide.
So if you've ever been embarrased before meet me half way and I'll know for sure.
At least we'll still be friends if I mess up again.
Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new.
Especially when that someone is you.
It ain't easy by being by yourself.
It's no fun to be alone, and I don't want to be alone.
