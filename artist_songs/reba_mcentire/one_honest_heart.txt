Times are tough on an honest heart.
People don't follow through with what they start.
Lyin' eyes looking at me up and down.
Makin' talk that's only cheap.
Makin' promises they never keep.
But I keep lookin' for what I still haven't found.

One honest heart.
That I can believe in.
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go.
One good man that I can count on.
It shouldn't be so hard.
Finding one honest heart.

Now I've been close a time or two.
I thought I saw my dreams comin' true.
But I was just livin' in a fairy tale.
I won't play the fool again.
I won't play a game that I can't win.
But I still have faith and I keep tellin' myself. There's...

One honest heart.
That I can believe in.
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go.
One good man that I can count on.
It shouldn't be so hard.
Finding one honest heart.

I don't think I'm asking too much.
Just once in my life I want to be touched by...

One honest heart.
That I can believe in.
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go.
One good man that I can count on.
It shouldn't be so hard.
Finding one honest heart.

One good man.

One honest heart.
That I can believe in.
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go.
One good man that I can count on.
It shouldn't be so hard.
Finding one honest heart.

One honest heart.

One honest heart.
That I can believe in.
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go.
One good man that I can count on.
It shouldn't be so hard.
Finding one honest heart.

One good man, one honest heart.
