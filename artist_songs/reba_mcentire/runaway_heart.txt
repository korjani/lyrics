I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

He's a fast rushing river I can't get across
Like an ocean of sadness, o'er which I am tossed
He never slows down, he's always ready to fly
And when I get next to you it's just hello
Hello and goodbye

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

No rope can hold down
He's not fit to be tied
Like the wildest of horses
Nobody can ride

Freedom's his distance
And the means to his end
So I'm giving up trying
Cause I'm just chasing, chasing the wind

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

In his runaway heart
