Better hang on to that matchbook with his number on it 
But not for the reason you think 
There'll come a day girl that you're gonna want it 
To light the past up in flames 
He's the lesson you learn 
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn 
He's that one last look back when you finally get over the hurt 
He's the bridge you burn 
He's the bridge you burn 
No you're not the first one to think they can change him 
Well that line of fools is so long 
But you'll be the only one you have to blame when 
You wake up and he's gone 
He's the lesson you learn 
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn 
He's that one last look back when you finally get over the hurt 
He's the bridge you burn, burn down 
Then you turn around and say 
Man that was a close one 
He's the lesson you learn 
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn 
He's the lesson you learn 
He's that one last look back when you get over the hurt 
He's the bridge you burn 
He's the bridge you burn 
Yeah he's the bridge you burn 
He's the bridge you burn 
Burn it down girl
