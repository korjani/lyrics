Riding up in Oklahoma
People call us blind
'Cause we believe in God and love
And old fashioned things
We still draw the line between wrong and right
And when a woman takes a husband it's for life

We met on a road from Tulsa
Travelers in the night
Well I knew we belong together
It just felt so right
There's something about this gal you ought to know
She's gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico

I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico
Or till the Rio Grande freezes over
Cause darling when God made our love
He threw away the mold
And I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico

If you should ever leave me
Heaven forbid
But you don't have to worry none
About me ?
You know exactly where I'll go
I'll be waiting for the snow in Mexico

I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico
Or till the Rio Grande freezes over
Cause darling when God made our love
He threw away the mold
And I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico

Cause darling when He made our love
He threw away the mold
I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico
