Lately I'm alone a lot.
Mostly I guess you're not.
Forgive me if I stop and stare.
I was just alittle unprepared.
So the world has fallen at your feet.
Yeah you hardly even missed a beat.
Everyday your heart beats a little stronger.
But my nights for me get a little longer.

You've gone on a million miles from here.
Swept up like a feather in the air.
Well you make it look so easy.
That doesn't seem quite fair.
'Cause baby I'm still tryin' to
get myself up and flying.

I should be farther on by now.
I just can't seem to catch a breeze somehow.
I should be free to leave the ground.
With no dreams left to weigh me down.
Well could you tell me what to do.
I've been tryin' to eny the truth.
But here it is now the living proof.
The one I love loves someone new.

You've gone on a million miles from here.
Swept up like a feather in the air.
Well you make it look so easy.
That doesn't seem quite fair.
'Cause baby I'm still tryin' to
get myself up and flying.

Oh you make it look so easy.
It doesn't seem quite fair.
'Cause baby I'm still tryin' to get myself.
Up and Flying
