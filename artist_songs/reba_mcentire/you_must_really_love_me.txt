Tell me why do you put up with my foolish ways
You never take to heart the crazy things I say
Oh I know you could walk out on me any day
There must be a darn good reason why you'd even want to stay

You must really love me
How can it be true
There are things you'll take from me
I won't even take from you
Everytime I fall apart
You always pull me through
You must really love me
As much as I love you
You must really love me
As much as I love you

I appreciate the honesty you've shown to me
And the way you tell your friends that you belong to me
And when you hold me tight it always sets me free
Oh this must be the way that true love was meant to be

You must really love me
How can it be true
There are things you'll take from me
I won't even take from you
Everytime I fall apart
You always pull me through
You must really love me
As much as I love you
You must really love me
As much as I love you
And Lord I'm glad you do
