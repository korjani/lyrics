As we sit out on the back porch
And the night begins to show
It feels good just to be here and unwind
And the sun is slowly setting
A reflection in your eyes
And when you look my way
I have to say
The thought that's crossed my mind

And you know there ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And we'll remain in love
With the kind of love
Most lovers never see

You always sit and listen
When I feel the need to talk
When I'm feeling insecure and filled with doubt
You've got the way to make me happy
And it's right there in your smile
And love for me will always be what I can't do without

And you know there ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And we'll remain in love
With the kind of love
Most lovers never see

There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
We'll remain in love..
