When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the Earth knows peace with men

When a star hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end

Touched only by the season
Swept clean by the [?] rain
Surveyed by every bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
