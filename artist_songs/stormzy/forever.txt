OK, how can I describe this? Beauty at its finest
You say you've been waiting for me to be your highness
Now I'm yours for the taking, so let's make this timeless
Forget those that are hating, you know they admired us, yeah
Girl, you the baddest
That's why I'll give you it the way you never had it
You keep it real, hold it down, let me see you turn around
Yeah, you got me in the zone right now

[1st Born:]
You've been on my mind
Let's do this right
Girl, take your time
You're finally mine

[1st Born:]
Oh, let's make this last forever
Forever, yeah
Forever
Forever
Oh, let's make this last forever
Yeah, forever, oh
Forever
Forever

[Stormzy:]
Look, can we make this last forever, please?
Your slim waist in those denim jeans will take care of my enemies
So I pray, my aura and my energy
Gets outshined by that Hennessy, still get it done, yeah, that's any means
And that's faith, we had love, I turned cold and left you broken
But you turned back cuh the love cuts deep and I let you breathe but you left me choking
And we all know that you had my soul when I had yours too but I still weren't coping
Feel like Frank would, fuel in my tank, got one more mile to the ocean
Then you come along but the summer's gone and this thing might take some time
All those summer songs and those Jägerbombs and that day when I made you mine
You're not blessed but you say you're fine, I could swear that's your favourite line
All that I need and you're all that I see, let me help you breathe, let me save your life
You get caught in a whirl when you talk to your girls and they say that I'm bad news
You get wrapped in their words and it actually hurts cause we both know that's not true
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's, it's time that we both take charge
If we get it right then we'll never die, I just hope we can make it last, yo

[1st Born:]
Oh, let's make this last forever
Forever, yeah
Forever
Forever
Oh, let's make this last forever
Yeah, forever, oh
Forever
Forever

[Stormzy:]
Yo, can we make this last forever?
Can we make the world spin slow? Let's work it out till it's better
I would never let this love grow, then you say never say never
And you kept me warm in the snow, with your tush as light as a feather
You said I was close to killing us both, we both know love's so painful
You came in my life and you made it alright and for that, man, I'm so grateful
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's and you need me to survive
You can light the way or return the flame, I just hope we can keep it alight, yo

[1st Born:]
Forever
Forever
Oh, let's make this last forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Oh, let's make this last forever
