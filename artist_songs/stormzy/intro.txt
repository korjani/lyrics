Look how far we've come
Sitting on my car with [?]
He told me that it's coming real soon
Like one more bang and then I swear you're gone
I said fuck that, man, you're coming up too
What's a man like me without his right hand man?
Cuh brudda you was there from the get-go
I'mma help you anytime that I can
Yeah I'mma help you anytime that you need me
Just be right there anytime I stand
Now I'll get the Porsches, Range and the Bentleys
To come pick us up every time we land
When them washed up dons tried to beef me
Brudda you was there every time I banged
I've had some real niggas feed me
I swear man I'll never ever bite that hand
Look nigga I was gassed when Skepta tweeted my tune
Just the fact that he's seen my stuff
Cause when you're coming from the bottom like me
Little things like that, man, they mean so much
When you're coming from the place I was raised up
Everybody knows that the grind don't stop
Just waiting for the day when [?] says let's buy a plane
And I say "yeah, fuck it, why not"
Now niggas wanna jump on the wave and I'm telling man straight
Man, you weren't never part of the club
I started ranting and raving
And Flipz said don't even talk too much
Flipz said remember the talks that we had on the roads
And never lose sight of the dream
I said yo brother, this is bigger than me now
I need to provide for the team
I need to give notes to my sisters
I need to buy mumsy a fan
And buy yards for the mandem
I do this for Elias and Brandon
So don't ever try tell me I'm selfish
I do this shit for the ones that I love
I do this for my bros cause they got me
Yeah, I do this for the ones that I trust
But nigga a change is coming
Yeah that's way overdue cause mumsy's account was way overdrafted
Yeah I've got so much to prove and there's so much to do
But I know where I started
And I know where I'm heading, yeah, look, I've got nothing to lose
And I'm still out here grafting
[?] has taught me a lesson, I told her I owe it to you cuh
Boy, this shit's been a struggle ever since we were kids
Coming home late, not even a penny to my name
Wouldn't even bother looking in the fridge
I ain't ever been the type of guy to complain
You don't even ever me rapping 'bout pain
Yeah man we've all got demons
So I can't hold feelings, I just knuckle up and then I pray
Just imagine if I didn't buss that case
Just imagine if I caught bus that day
Mum's life, I was in a rush that day
Swear man I'll never lose trust and faith
So sorry if I come across angry
If I love you there's no need to fight me
I'm just trying to be all that I can be
I just hope I bring it home for the family
