(Yo)
Yo gang
(Yes my brother)
You still don't sound sure
(Na, na I'm in the booth right now, right now)
(I'm in here right now)
Alright, let's start then
Alright look, let's just get one thing clear, I don't fuck about
I am the certi' one
I am the one that they call 'Gangster of Grime'
I don't like it but I don't mind it
But I need everyone to know, and I'm not just talking about the hood, I ain't just talking about the basics
I'm talking about the whole island of this country, needs to understand what is about to happen
If you put all bias aside, Stormzy has to be Neo, he has to be
So therefore that makes me Morpheus so I'm telling the council right now
This kid, no joke, you can hate him all you want
This kid has to be seeing the game in zeros and ones, like, it's not normal, it's not normal
So #MERKY, #PROBLEM, #WICKEDSKENGMAN
(Mad bro)
Na, I like that one, no I like that one
And I don't even know what a hashtag is, I just know it's proper Merky
You know a hashtag's a bit more advanced than me
But what people do need to understand is, you see anyone from my era of grime, need to recognise
That if you cannot fathom that this guy's about to take it from a second rate genre to a first rate genre
Then you need to look at yourself and be ashamed, seriously, you have to be ashamed
Because we started from the roots of this ting
(Word)
Now we've gone past the roots, it's a whole digital age, we don't need the middle man
Mr. Smith is nearly obsolete, we don't need those label ones again
(Word)
We can actually just shot it ourselves and cut through
So everyone needs to understand that when I'm telling you, and I'm certi', my name's Crazy Titch, I'm definitely one million percent certified
I know certi' guys from all over, Brum, Manchester, Notts, Sheffield, Leeds, Manny, Liverpool
These people all say the same thing, 'We don't really even know what grime is but we know who Stormzy is'
You know like, so, I don't wanna hear man say 'I'm too gangster listening to Stormzy'
Shut up, that's a lie, you ain't
You know them ones right there
(Hahaha, word)
It just means you're a hater, na real talk, it just means you're a hater
You know what, that's what it is, this is my opinion and it is my opinion, I don't care what no one says
Real talk, those old guys that don't wanna bring him in
Whatever man, fuck yourself man, you know like real talk
(Mad brother)
Get a Coke and a smile man, seriously, don't play them round there, know mine brudda
All them other side crap guys better just shut their mouth, you get what I'm trying to say
Yeah man, there you go
(Fucking Crazy Titch, my brother, oi listen, hahaha oi, what)
