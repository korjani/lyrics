She said she's tired of my antics
Came to her uni and I had a madness with one little dickhead on her campus
Now I'm looking like a villain ca' I find it hard to fit in with the high life and the champers
And I always fuck it up when I try and buckle up and then attempt to be romantic
She's the princess, I'm the bandit
She's the painting; I'm the canvas but this pictures not so pretty
I'm just trying to understand this, could you tell me what the plan is
Could you spare me with the pity?
We're not speaking the same language
But see all my problems vanish every single time you're with me
So why should I be embarrassed when I bring you to my city?
Baby welcome to my city
