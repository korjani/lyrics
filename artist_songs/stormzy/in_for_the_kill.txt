[La Roux:]
We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot, ooh
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust, ooh
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotion, ooh
What are feelings without emotions?

[Chorus - La Roux:]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
[x2]

Jack played me the beat, I was gassed
Then he asked "what you gonna do when you rap to the tune?"
I said hold on, let me just spaz
I'mma go mad, turn the whole thing up in my speaker
Let me tear the whole ting down, fuck a feature
Jumping around in my house, [?]
Cause he gotta calm down, take a breather
Peng tings on the WhatsApp, peng tings on my BB too
Fuckboys wanna see me lose, shine bright like RiRi's tune
Still got an item in a rucksack, but now I've got CDs too
Ayy, look fuckboy, be you, if you say you've done that then I must've, me too
[?] Wretch man if I'm 32
Still got love for my CDs too
Wanna beef [?] Gotta beef me too
Wanna squeeze that Jack? Then I'm squeezing too
Wanna speak and chat but you're beefing who?
Beefing me? Niggas couldn't beef my crew
They can't make a one decent tune
Leave it, tell your boys leave it too
I'm going in deep, going in real like
Check 1-2, check 2 one time
Got a few dons who love gun crime
Got a few dons who run [?]
Go hard for my dons who ain't done time
All of my dons hate that I'm unsigned
Told em that it's soon my time
Check 1-2, check 2 one time

I make these rappers wanna retire
Ooh, cause I just spit that nice fire
[x2]

[Chorus]
