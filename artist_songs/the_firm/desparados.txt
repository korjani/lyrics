[Nas Escobar]
You ever dance with the devil under the pale moonlight?
Desperados, travellin
What the fuck's up son?
We could do this word up, we could do this

[Chorus: The Firm]
Spend too many nights on the Henny gettin right
Breakin big face Bennies, bettin against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's goin too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never recorded
[x2]

[Canibus]
At a thousand degree Celsius I make MC's melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot lookin for shade
I rearrange your rib cage like a twelve gauge at close range
and change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than runningback
Stunning man with brave and cunning rap
Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flippin like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analog tapes to digital DAT's
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always
tryin to diss back, cause niggaz keep tellin you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps rushin you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
til I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringin the wrong raps to combat
Like bringin a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggaz is wack, rappin over microphone feedback
My intelligence begins where yours peaks at
From Fox Boogie in the see-through brasierre, to Nasty Nas here
My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear

[Nas and Foxy Brown]
Millionaire look at the sky make sure it's still there
Ice grill stares and my jewelry is in every year
Pierre Cardan back in a Dapper Dan time
Now flex, angle wrecks, Foxy rock Van Klein

[Nas Escobar]
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit

[AZ the Visualiza]
Yo lock in, do the knowledge, follow the doctrine
We clockin, on your airwaves, keepin it rockin
Blaze up, make fire, light your Purple Haze up
Betcha tired, bitch ass niggaz need to be caged up
So raise up fuck the playin, I'm sick of layin
I can picture sprayin off an SK, shells ricochetin
Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'
Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will
Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog-ged, another had more deez involved
Known freeze condo seize seven keys dissolved
Daily routine, speakin up for niggaz who sling
Hand to hand on them street corners claimin you king
It's time to lock this, join with us, let your glock spit
Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggaz drop snitch
Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out
Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South

[Nature]
Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics
Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand ,the gorgeous bitches
Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live
A true Desperado, one that never choose sides
and show sympathy, just QB, an entity
Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me
Image is nothin just obey your thirst
I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze, then display your birth
For those concerned or just eager to learn
I speak for The Firm, was told to keep the cheeba to burn
Stashin my riches, past traditions, like Olympics
pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts, I'm driftin
It's type ill wakin up lookin like filth
Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free
Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless
Guns and westins, learnin to connect through lessons
From cool feats to camps, niggaz shoot back
It's a proven fact, nine-seven's mine, y'all niggaz move back

[Chorus]
