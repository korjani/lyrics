I can get there on my own
You can leave me here alone
I'm just trying to do what's right
Oh, a man ain't a man unless he's fought the fight
I could never point you out
A waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what's right, then you'll walk away

When the walls come down
When the walls come down

One by one, I've seen them fall
Some just don't show up at all
I'm just here to fight the fire
Oh, a man ain't a man unless he has desire

And the walls come down
And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
You threw it away
Western girl, with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there's nothing in the way
In the way

When the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
You threw it away
Western girl, with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there's nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
When the walls come down
