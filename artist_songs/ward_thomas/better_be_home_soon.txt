Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You better be home soon

So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone, oh
It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You better be home soon
