I met a man locked away, for things he hadn't done.
Innocence on ball and chain. He'll never feel the sun Again on his face, or roses in his hands.
but when he smiled at me, I could understand.

If you're free you'll never see the walls.
If your head is clear you'll never free fall.
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong.
If your head is high you'll never fear at all.

There was a daughter of a man, who took his life too young;
She swore she'd never do the same, Then did just what he'd done.
And a boy who's gone insane, heard Voices in his head;
No one knows what they say, now his mother's dead.

If you're free you'll never see the walls.
If your head is clear you'll never free fall.
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong.
If your head is high you'll never fear at all.

There was a man who had a face, that looked a lot like me.
I saw him in the mirror and, I fought him in the street;
Then when he turned away, I shot him in the head.
Then I came to realize, I had killed myself.

If you're free you'll never see the walls.
If your head is clear you'll never free fall.
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong.
If your head is high you'll never fear...
