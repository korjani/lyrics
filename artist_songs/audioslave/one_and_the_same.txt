Well they don't hate you, you know they love you
But they're gonna come kill you
They don't mean you any harm
It's just what they do
Could be your mother
Could be your father
Or your best friend in the world

But just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You wear a mask with a target
Keep your enemies closer
You fall in love from a great height, now the easy part's over
Choose your battles, not your soldiers
You're never sure of their colors

But just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same
Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Just like blood and rain, love and pain are one and the same (One and the same)
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
