And with the early dawn
Moving right along, I couldn't buy an eye-full of sleep
And in the aching night under satellites, I was not received
Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart, someone get me a priest to put my mind to bed
This ringing in my head, is this a cure or is this a disease?

Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

And in the after birth, on the quiet earth, let the stains remind you, you thought you made a man
You better think again, before my role defines you

Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
And in your waiting hands, I will land, and roll out of my skin
And in your final hours I will stand, ready to begin?
Ready to begin? ready to begin? ready to begin?

Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head, from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Show me how to live, show me how to live
Show me how to live, show me how to live
