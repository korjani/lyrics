The obliteration of your isolation
the complete explosion of your fondest notion
This disintegration is your elevation
It's a grand illusion, it's a grand illusion

You're crying, you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing
a hundred thousand years
There is only one day
and tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion

The devastation of your separation
The disillusion of your constitution
It's exhilaration, it's your liberation
It's a grand illusion, it's a grand illusion

You're crying, you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing a hundred thousand years
There is only one day and tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion
