Every day I thank the Lord above
For giving me such a way with love
Oohh baby, what I wouldn't do
Just to be alone with you

You'd be crazy to resist
(You'd be crazy to resist)
I won't rest until I'm properly kissed
(Until I'm kissed)
Oohh baby, what I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
Just to be alone with you

I'm a full-grown woman and I'm in my prime
I know how to love you and I take my time
I'll wrap you up in all my curls
Make you forget all about your other girls

No one will know baby, no one will see
(No one will see)
No one can touch you now because you're safe with me
(You're safe with me)
Oohh baby, what I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
Just to be alone with you

Oohh baby, what I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
Just to be alone with you
(Just to be alone with you)
Just to be alone with you
(Just to be alone with you)
Oh just to be alone
Just to be alone
