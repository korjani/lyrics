I'll just keep on falling in love
Til I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird
Hungry for the skies
But if I try my wings
And try long enough
I'm bound to learn to fly
I'll just keep on falling in love
Til I get it right

My door to love has opened out
More times than in
I'm either fool or wise enough
To open it again
Cause I'll never know what's beyond the mountain
Til I reach the other side
I'll just keep on falling in love
Til I get it right

If practice makes perfect
Then I'm near about as perfect
As I'll ever be in my life
I'll just keep on falling in love
Til I get it right
