Comin' out of the window
Watchin' down from the wall
Billie listens to your heartbeat
Floatin' down the hall
You think my eyes are covered over
You think my heart has crawled away
Billie listens to your heartbeat
When I don't know what to say
I meant to be your drivin' wheel

I meant to be your swing
If I had a tongue like that
I would keep you safe
I would keep you safe from everything
I made a deal with the ocean
I made a deal with the ground
Billie listins to your heartbeat
When I'm not around
When I'm not around
