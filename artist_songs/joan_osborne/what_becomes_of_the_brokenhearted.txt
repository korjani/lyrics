As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Maybe

The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere

What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Help me, please

I'm searching though I don't succeed
For someone's love there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Tell me
what becomes of the broken-hearted
Tell me, tell me

what becomes of the broken-hearted
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oooh...
The broken-hearted
Now departed

I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone who cares

What becomes of the broken-hearted
Now
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
