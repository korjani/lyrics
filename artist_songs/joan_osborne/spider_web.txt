"I dreamed about Ray Charles last night and he could see just fine"

I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
And he could see just fine, you know
I asked him for a lullaby. He said, 
"Honey, I don't sing no more" 
No more, no more, no more, Ray don't sing no more

He said, "Since I got my eyesight back, my voice has just deserted me
No 'Georgia On My Mind' no more. I stay in bed with MTV" 
Then Ray took his glasses off and I could look inside his head
Flashing like a thunderstorm, I saw a shining spider web

Spider web, spider web, spider web in Ray Charles' head

I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
He took me flying in the air
Showed me my own spider web; Said, 
"Honey, you had best take care
The world is made of spider webs
the threads are stuck to me and you 
Careful what you're wishing for, 
'cause when you gain, you just might lose" 

You just might lose your spider web, spider web, spider web Ray Charles said

When you're feeling lonely, when you're hiding in your bed, 
don't forget your string of pearls, don't forget your spider web
When I go to sleep tonight, don't let me dream of brother Ray
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he sees
Just like him best the other way

Spider web, spider web, spider web Ray Charles said
Spider web, spider web, spider web Ray Charles' head

All I got's my spider web, keepin' me alive
All I got's my spider web, keepin' me alive

"Come on Ray"
