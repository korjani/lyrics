How will we stay on the sidewalk 
When there is no gravity 
Piece of paper floating upward 
But no one stops to see 
And you think that I'm the right one 
'Cause I know just what to say 
And you ask me to convince you 
That you won't blow away 
In this wild wild world 
Wild, wild world 
By the river 
Well we made them to be broken 
Sorry if they let you down 
Sorry if the ones you know 
Are vanishing all over town 
And I need someone to hold me 
And I ask you to be fair 
And you'd like to give me something 
But we both know there ain't a lot 
Ain't a lot to spare 
In this wild, wild world 
Wild, wild world 
Oh are you listening 
To make sure I'm still here? 
Oh did you know 
That the river burns like gasoline 
And they can't turn on the rain machine 
And they tell me there is no more space 
Won't you turn around 
'Cause I hate it when I cannot see your face 
In this wild, wild world 
In this wild, wild world 
Wild, wild world 
By the river
