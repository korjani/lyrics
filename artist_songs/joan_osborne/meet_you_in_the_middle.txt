Though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

People are known to be reckless
To never let go of their pride
But honey I believe we've been careless
Cause the damage just can't be denied

Oh, before we start
We're miles apart
And there's a million reasons why
But I wake to find
You're still on my mind
It's stronger as the years go by

I'd like to sit down with you darlin'
Show you everything in my heart
But emotions run high when I see your face
I just don't know where to start

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day

Mm, if all for this
Just one more kiss
I'd travel any distance to find
Your eyes of coal
Your secret soul
I swear that I could read your mind

Honey you can call me crazy
To think that our affection could last
But I see us throw it all together
After all the storms have passed

Oh, though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Some day
