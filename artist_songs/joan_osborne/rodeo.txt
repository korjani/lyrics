Call me home, call me home
Baby when you coming home
I can't stand it so alone
Rodeo

They all say they're proud of you
Though you're still the boy I knew
What has fighting done to you
Rodeo

I been dreaming boy since you been gone
'Bout a cowboy risin' with the dawn
It's just a dream but it keeps me hangin' on
Oh rodeo, you been gone too long

A-hee
Yippee-a-yay, yippee-a-yo
A-hee
Yippee-a-yay, yippee-a-yo

Up all night, I'll be here
Dancin' with my darkest fear
Whisperin' your home is here
Rodeo

Call me home, call me home
Baby when you coming home
I can't stand it so alone
Rodeo

I been dreaming boy since you been gone
'Bout a soldier risin' with the dawn
It's just a dream but it keeps me hangin' on
Oh rodeo, you been gone too long

A-hee
Yippee-a-yay, yippee-a-yo
A-hee
Yippee-a-yay, yippee-a-yo

Hee...

Rodeo
Oh rodeo
Oh...
Call me home
When you coming home
You can call me home
Oh rodeo
