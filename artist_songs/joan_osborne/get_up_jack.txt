Get up Jack, crack your head 
Sweatin' whiskey in my bed 
Ain't you heard a word I've said 
Get up Jack 
Get up Jack, read the news 
See if you can tie your shoes 
Find another friend to use 
Get up Jack 
[CHORUS]
And come down, come down 
Long enough to see my face 
Come down, come down 
Get up Jack, run and hide 
Tell us all how hard you tried 
Burn your bridges, drown your pride 
Get up Jack 
Get up Jack, crack your head 
Been so long since I fed 
You ain't heard a word I've said 
Get up Jack 
[REPEAT CHORUS]
If I came in a bottle... 
It was a mighty good year 
How come I don't get you high 
How come you're still here 
God, you were so beautiful 
I used to watch you sleep 
God, God so beautiful 
Too much promise to keep 
Get up Jack, go to hell 
Baby I can taste the smell 
Wish I didn't, truth to tell 
Know you, know you so damn well 
Get up Jack
