Why does it take so long for you to leave me 
Once you've said goodbye 
I wish it could be over quickly 
Clean and painless and dry 
But your kiss has left its taste with me 
And your hands have left their mark 
My ears are full of whispers 
And murmurs in the dark 
Why does it take so long for you to leave me 
Now that you're not here 
I wish that I could fight this feelin' 
Make you disappear 
But my body has a memory 
And it holds you close within 
The smell of you at midnight 
The flavor of your skin 
[CHORUS]
I feel your fingerprints 
On my heart 
I thought that I could handle you 
I thought I was so smart 
Now I feel your fingerprints 
Nothin' I can do 
Ain't it touching how I can't get over you 
I can't believe I can't forget you 
You didn't matter that much 
Is it gonna take another man 
To wash away your touch 
[REPEAT CHORUS]
