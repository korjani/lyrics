And your hands are really shakin something awful
As you light your 27th cigarette
Oh how long have you been sittin in the darkness
You forget
Oh you know you're gettin really hard to be with
And you're cryin every time you turn around
And you wonder why you can not pick your head up
Off the ground

Oh my crazy baby
Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don't put out the light, the light,
the light, the light

And they look at you like they don't speak your language
And you're living at the bottom of a well
And you swallowed all the awful bloody secrets
That you can't tell
Oh you know you ought to get yourself together
But you can not bear to walk outside your door
No, you can not bear to look into the mirror
Anymore, anymore

Oh my crazy baby
Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don't put out the light, the light,
the light, the light

And your hands are really shakin something awful
As your worries crawl around inside your clothes
Ooh how long will you be sittin in the darkness
Heaven knows

Oh my crazy baby
Try to hold on tight
Oh my crazy baby
Don't put out the light, the light,
the light, the light, the light,
the light, the light, the light,
the light, the light
