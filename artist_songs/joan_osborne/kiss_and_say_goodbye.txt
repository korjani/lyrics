I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

We been meeting here so long
I guess what we've done, oh was wrong
Please darlin' don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do

It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Baby I'll need, I'll need another guy
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

We been meeting here so long
I guess what we've done, oh was wrong
Please darlin' don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Oohh...
I'm gonna miss you baby
Understand me, won't you try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
