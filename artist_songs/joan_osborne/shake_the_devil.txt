Guess I had to find out the hard way
The things that I have come here to learn
Fire of this pleasure, it can warm me
But in the end it only burns
He could put me high on a pedestal
He could rob me of my shame
He could hold me down under water
Till I could not remember my own name

In my mind, I see the house I'm buildin'
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

In my time I've done some meanness
Brought the ones I love so much pain
Pride, it was eatin' all my heart away
My soul it was rustin' in the rain
And all these sins I am confessin'
They still come knockin' on my door
But I know better than to answer
I tell them that girl don't live here anymore

In my mind, I see the house I'm buildin'
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Every livin' thing is callin' out to me
The leaves on the trees wave me on
Got a wind to lift me when I'm fallin'
Got a road to put my feet upon

In my mind, I see the house I'm buildin'
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

In my mind, I see the house I'm buildin'
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Gonna shake that devil off my trail
Gonna shake that devil off my trail
