You used to bury me, way underground 
I thought it had to be this way 
But I've been watching you 
And I get smarter every day 
Take the voices from your mouth 
I've got the key to this door 
I've learned to work the new machines 
I'm not afraid anymore 
What you gonna do 
What you gonna do about me 
You've been stealing all the air 
You've been using all the sound 
I made a deal with the ocean 
I made a deal with the ground 
What you gonna do 
What you gonna do about me 
I am riding on the bus 
I am working at my job 
I am calling out your name 
I am standing at your door 
I am counting up the money 
I am carrying my child 
I am coming down your driveway 
I am giving you a chance
