[Chorus:]
Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow

Eve take a train, Eve took a train
Went to see her man
Melting inside, melting away
Like butter in the pan

[Chorus]

Eve took a fruit, Eve bit the fruit
Just ran down her chin
Babies will put things in their mouths
Never heard of sin

Lumina
Open like the sea
Lumina
Sing me in the dark

Eve had to ask, Eve had to ask
What is wrong with this?
Here is the place, now is the time
Let's invent the kiss

Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Come and wrap around me

Come and wrap around me [x3]
