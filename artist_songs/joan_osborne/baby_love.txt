Tender as a peach
Someone I would love to teach
Started as a joke
just a lazy little poke
Wake up one sweet day
and I could not run away
Ears will start to bleed
No I cannot take this speed

I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again

I was innocent
wonder where your manners went
How was I to know
if would never let me go
Drag it through the mud
will we ever see some blood
You would try to leave
something I cannot conceive

I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again

Take me in your fist
prove to me that you exist
Be as plain as day
watch my body melt away
There in black and white
victim of my appetite
Make me understand
do you want to be the man

I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again
I'm in love baby love again
