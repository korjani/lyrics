I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone

Darkness all around me
Blackin’ out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin’ to anyone

Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
I go right on livin'
But why I just don't know

Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood

Such a sad, sad season
When a good love dies.
Not a day goes by
When I don’t realize

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

I got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone
