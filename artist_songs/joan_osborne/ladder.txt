Today and everyday, today and everyday
Today and everyday, today and everyday

I'm standin' here in your closet
Unbuttonin' all your clothes
I sleep in your bed tonight
But I never find you home
You're givin' me crooked answers
I'm crackin' your little code
I'm learnin' another language
So full it's about to explode

You gave me a ladder now
I surely believe I'll climb
It don't even matter now
I'm willing to take my time

I'm gonna love you anyway, 
Today and every day, today and everyday
I'm gonna love you anyway, 
Today and every day, today and everyday

I wanted it to be easy
I know that I'll make you tired
Some tell me you're slow and lazy
Some tell me you're so inspired
You wanted a long flirtation
Your plane doesn't ever land
Some things I don't want to look at
I don't want to understand 

You gave me a ladder now
I surely believe I'll climb
It don't even matter now
I'm willing to take my time

I'm gonna love you anyway, 
Today and every day, today and everyday
I'm gonna love you anyway, 
Today and every day, today and everyday

Today and everyday...
