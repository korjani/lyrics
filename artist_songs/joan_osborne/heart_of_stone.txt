Leanin' against the window of a white hotel room
Lookin' down at Dallas, shining in the heat
Honey when you move it's graceful as a panther
Open up your lips and my heart skips a beat

You suffer so pretty like a ragged apostle
You burn oh so brightly like a soldering gun
And I gave my body and soul to relieve you
But now you have told me that I'm not the one

And if I'm not the one
Baby baby if I'm not the one

Ohhh who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone

I believed my love
Could take away your darkness
Was strong enough to fight all the demons in your dreams
Little did I know the weight would pull me under
Now I watch us both come apart at the seams

And if I'm not the one
Ohhh baby baby if I'm not the one

Ohhh who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone
Your heart of stone

Ohhh who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone 
Your heart of stone
