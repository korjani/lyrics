To an honest man
I could give my body and my soul
With a practiced hand
You could lift me up and make me whole

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I smell the ocean in the dawn
And the bitter times have come and gone

In a gypsy cab
On the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise
We are going home
And the lust is flirting in your eyes

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I smell the ocean in the dawn
And the bitter times have come and gone
Have come and gone
Have come and gone
Have come and gone

Lalala...

In a hotel room
Up above the lights of Tompkins Square
While the music plays
I'm on my way to meet you there

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
And I'm back where I belong
And the bitter times have come and gone

Lalala...

Ooh...

To the one I love I give the key
And his eyes are stars that shine on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine... on me
Oh shine on me
Oh shine on me

Shine on me
Oh shine on me
