I was a troubled soul 
I had a worried mind 
Drifting from place to place 
I was the restless kind 
Right there in front to me 
bright as the light of day 
you saw a broken girl 
You loved me anyway 

And if I sprouted wings 
I would not be amazed 
cause faith is a mystery that 
rocks me for days and days and day and 
I could be in the street 
I could be on a train 
or struck in some doorway down 
in the pouring rain 
Now there is not one place 
that doesn't feel like home 
No matter where I go 
I know I'm not alone 

[Chorus:]
I've never been so sure of love 

And if I sprouted wings 
I would not be amazed 
cause faith is a mystery that 
rocks me for days and days and day 
Oh you can ask me once 
And I will tell you twice 
No one's convincing me 
this isn't paradise 
And if I cause you pain 
I'd only hurt myself 
cause we have a righteous love 
I feel for on one else 

[Chorus:]
I've never been so sure of love
