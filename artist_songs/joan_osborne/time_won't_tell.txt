I can't believe that after all this time
You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave the love behind afraid of what we felt
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why, they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and go
That time won't tell

Time won't tell me how it might have been
And time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run those memories in black and white

I watch us kiss good-bye that day
Here's where you turn around and walk away
Where were the words that would have made you stay
Well, time won't tell

Time won't tell me how it might have been
And time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run those memories in black and white

You never see the road you didn't take
You never feel the love you failed to make
But you never know might be the words to say
And time won't tell
Time won't tell
