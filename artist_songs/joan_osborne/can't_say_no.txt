And if you say to me it's wrong, I know
But here we are and I refuse to go
I can't go on without the love we make
Your touch is all I need to cure this day

I can't say no, how hard I've tried
How long I've run to try and hide
How deep my love, so sweet tonight
I can't say no, any more

And if you say to me it's all a dream
And let me sleep so happily, it seems
Don't wake me up without the love we make
Your touch is all I need to cure this day

I can't say no, how hard I've tried
How long I've run to try and hide
How deep my love, so sweet tonight
I can't say no, any more

I can't say no, I can't say no
I can't say no, anymore
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)

I can't say no, I can't say no
I can't say no, anymore
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)

I can't say no, I can't say no
I can't say no, anymore
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)

I can't say no, I can't say no
I can't say no, anymore
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)

(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)
(can't say no, can't say no, can't say)
