Daddy-o, daddy-o when I close my eyes
There's a cyclone there and I want to rise
An electric train to a long lost world
To a land of a thousand dancing girls

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the world I left behind
To the Coney Island line

Oh daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy tell me the tale that the captain told
When the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
We will all be safe, we will be there soon
We will all have fun when we reach the moon

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the moon I left behind
Down the Coney Island line
Oh daddy-o, daddy-o

Daddy-o, daddy-o, can you make me feel
Like the way I did on the Wonder Wheel
Can you love me now as you loved me then
Can you dream that parachute dream again

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the dream I left behind
Down the Coney Island line

Come to me, my daddy-o
Take me where I want to go
To the world I left behind
To the Coney Island line

Oh daddy-o, daddy-o
Oh daddy-o, daddy-o
