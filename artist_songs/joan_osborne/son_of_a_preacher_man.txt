Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talking
That's when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my suprise 

[Chorus:]
The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I tried
When he started sweet talking to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight

[Chorus]

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each others knowing
Looking to see how much we'd grown

The only boy who could ever move me
Was the son of a preacher man 
The only boy who could ever groove me
Was the son of a preacher man 
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was
