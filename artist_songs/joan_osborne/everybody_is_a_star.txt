Everybody is a star 
Who can rain and chase the dust away 
Everybody wants to shine 
Ooh, come out on a cloudy day 
'Til the sun that loves you proud 
When the system tries to bring you down 
Every hand to shine tonight 
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right 

Everybody is a star 
I can feel it when you shine on me 
I love you for who you are 
Not the one you feel you need to be 
Ever catch a falling star 
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground 
Everybody is a star 
One big circle going round and round
