I met you in the upper room
Of a house where I slept with the angels
From hell and from heaven
Some for haunting, some for guarding
Each to his own purpose over my trembling skin

And I kept my secrets far from your condition
And in the explosions they both were just powders
In faded jean jackets to look just like our daddies

Did you say your lovers were liars?
All my lovers were liars too
Did you say you were afraid of dying?
I ain't lived a single day without you

Do you wanna come over?
I was just about to miss you
Did you say you were lonely?
I was just about to call you

You rang on a Wednesday night
I was buried in the churchyard
In the engines of desire in the come down daylight
I believe my trouble and your trouble shook hands

Did you say your lovers were liars?
All my lovers were liars too
Did you say you were afraid of dying?
I ain't lived a single day without you

Do you wanna come over?
I was just about to call you
Did you say you were lonely?
I was just about to miss you

Did you say your lovers were liars?
All my lovers were liars too
Did you say you were afraid of dying?
Baby, I ain't lived a single day without you

Did you wanna come over?
I was just about to miss you
Did you say you was lonely?
I was right about to call you

Do you believe there's a heaven?
Do you think we're invited?
You've done some bad things
And I was a killer

Did you wanna come over?
I was just about to miss you
Did you say you were lonely?
I was just about to call you
