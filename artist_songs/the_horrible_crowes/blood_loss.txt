My first love was an arsonist
Black eyes, deep set and avarice
Red lips built like a tomb
You'll never get out of this (some day I'll see to this)
And moonlight I found would bow
To her slender hand stretched out
Fingers inside your heart and your mind
You'll never get out of this (some day I'll see to this)
Boy...

And I'll tell you when it's over
I'll tell you when you can leave
I'll tell you when you cried long enough
Til your blood fills my cup
And my footsteps, they hung in your hallways enough
For you to be truly haunted (baby, by me)

My first love was a murderer
Before I ever got to her
Tongue so sharp and serpentine
Waltz to remember her (I'll call you later)
And I heard a curse being born
Forming each finger and forming each thorn
Til I became like a stone
Things never got better (but I'll call you later)
And practicing lies to drip like red wine off her lips

And I'll tell you when it's over
I'll tell you when you can leave
I'll tell you when you cried long enough
Til your blood fills my cup
My footsteps, they hung in your hallways enough
For you to be truly haunted

And I'll tell you when it's over
I'll tell you when you can leave
I'll tell you when you cried long enough
Til your blood fills my cup
My footsteps, they hung in your hallways enough
For you to be truly haunted

(When your blood starts counting losses)
When your blood counts its losses
(When your blood starts counting losses)
When your blood counts its losses
(When your blood starts counting losses)
When your blood counts its losses

Sirens they come and the sirens they leave
Sirens they come and the sirens they leave
Sirens they come and the sirens they leave
Sirens they come and the sirens they leave
