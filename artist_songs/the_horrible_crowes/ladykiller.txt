Watch me slide over here
Feel me breathe over there
I seen a ghost in our willow
Must've lost his lover somewhere
I been around a few times
Never caught a fever like you
Never seen me a woman
Turn a deeper shade of blue

And you must've met a man
Tall and handsome at that
Who must've put a spell on you, baby
Must've kept coming back
Cause I can smell him in your skin
I bet I taste him in your blood
Must be all the young boys, baby
Lady killer got the two of us

And how about this for a good one
Maybe we don't ever come down
I can leave the wound wide open
And maybe see if I can tough it out
Let it pour over my head
All your shame and your history
And see if I say a thing
As it rolls up inside of me

And you must've met a man
Tall and handsome at that
Who must've put a spell on you, baby
And must've kept on coming back
Cause I can smell him in your skin
I bet I taste him in your blood
Must be all the young boys, baby
Lady killer got the two of us

Don't cha say it feels like heaven
If you could sleep through the night
I used to just lay down and close my eyes
And it would feel like heaven
If I could sleep for a while
I used to float right above the fire

And you must've met a man
Tall and handsome at that
Who must've put a spell on you, baby
And must've kept on coming back
Cause I can smell him in your skin
I bet I taste him in your blood
Must be all the young boys, baby
Lady killer got the both of us
Lady killer got the both of us
Young boys, baby

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Lady killer got the both of us
Young boys, baby
