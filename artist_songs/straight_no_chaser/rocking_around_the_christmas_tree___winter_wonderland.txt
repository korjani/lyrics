Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
Beautiful sight we are happy tonight
Rocking in the winter wonderland

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way
