Darling, you send me I know you send me
Darling, you send me Honest, you do
Honest, you do
Honest, you do

Ohh, you thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling, you, you, you thrill me
Honest, you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, oh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

Ohh, you, you, you send me

Ohh, whenever I'm with you I know
I know, I know and I need you
Honest, you do
Honest, you do

Ohh, I know, I know, I know
When you hold me
Whenever you kiss me
Honest, you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, ooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

Ohh, you, you, you send me
Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest, you do
