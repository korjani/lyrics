Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
(This one goes out to Santa's little helper)
(Down in Memphis Tennessee)
Well, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground

Well, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
You've been a real good little girl
And Santa clause is back in town

And I brought you some presents baby

Got no a sleigh with reindeer, no sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin' in a big black Cadillac

Oh, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
It's like powdered sugar, honey
Oh, you've been a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town

You know, baby, a man gets lonely up at the North Pole
Just surrounded by elves and reindeer
Baby, I think it's time I come down to Memphis
For some good old southern lovin'

Maybe some bacon, peanut butter
And banana sandwiches on the griddle
Some pigs' feet flavored eggnog
Ginger bread houses made out of spam

Get a fruitcake and dip it in beef gravy with a side of pork ribs
Baby, have you ever had a candy cane made out of mayonnaise?
It's delightful

Oh, I'm poppin' out of my jump suit here
Baby, hang up those stockin's and turn off the light
You're gonna hear me comin' down the chimney tonight

Oh, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
Looks like frosting coming off a doughnut
Well, you've been a real good little girl
And Santa Claus is back in town

Oh, I'm havin' a heart attack, hold on for a second
Well, you've been a real good little girl baby
And Santa Claus is back in town, whoa

Come on, Rudolph make a left over there by the Denny's
Daddy's gotta get some sugar free plum pudding
A quart of eggnog and a mince meat pie
Merry Christmas very much
