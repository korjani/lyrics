When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry,
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
You're so very special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control,
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul,
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

She's running out,
She's run
She's running out,
She's run
She run...
Run...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special

Creep, I'm a weirdo,
What am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here
