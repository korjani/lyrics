Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's kama sutra show and tell 
Woah, there's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer (Ooh it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle (It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you babe

Woah, there's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer (Ooh it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle (It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Ooh babe, you got the healing that you want (yeah)
Like they say it in the song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want, yeah
Just like they say it in the song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want, yeah
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in a song until the dawn, 
let's Marvin Gaye get it on
Oooh
