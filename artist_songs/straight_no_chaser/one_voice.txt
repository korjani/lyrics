One voice
Singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Singing so they hear what's on your mind
And when you look around you'll find
There's more than

One voice
Singing in the darkness
Joining with your one voice
Each and every note another octave
Hands are joined and fears unlocked

If only one voice
Would start it on its own
We need just one voice facing the unknown
And then that one voice would never be alone
It takes that one voice

It takes that one voice
Just one voice
Singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Shout it out and let it ring

Just one voice
It takes that one voice
And everyone will sing
