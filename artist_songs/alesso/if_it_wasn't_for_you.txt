I was alone
I was made of stone
You took me home
We've built a world, a world for us
We flew like birds, a new beginning

It's better (better, better), you keeping me together (—gether—gether)
You know that I will never (never, ever) try to pull you down, down
Lover (lover lover), you can always be here, I'll take cover
You know that I will never (never, ever) leave you all alone

I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you

I was a fool
Always keeping a distance
If I'd ever known,
You found a way
I thought I'd always stay the same
Because of you, I saw a new beginning

It's better (better, better), you keeping me together (—gether—gether)
You know that I will never (never, ever) try to pull you down, down
Lover (lover, lover), you can always be here, I'll take cover
You know that I will never (never, ever) leave you all alone

I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you
