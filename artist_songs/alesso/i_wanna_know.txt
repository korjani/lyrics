[Vinz:]
I've been hit by stars, a beauty you are, a beauty you are
Day turns into night, you light up my dark, you light up my dark

You're the one that I see waking up next to me
And I hope it's the same for you
But you play with my mind when you send me these signs
And I see other guys get 'em too

I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Where do we go, where do we go
From hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Why are you keeping me on hold
Don't wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or is it no
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Nico:]
Diamonds in your eyes cover your lies, cover your lies
Trust me we can be special tonight, special tonight

You're the one that I see waking up next to me
And I hope it's the same for you
But you play with my mind when you send me these signs
And I see other guys get 'em too

[Vinz:]
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Where do we go, where do we go
From hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Why are you keeping me on hold
Don't wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or is it no 
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Nico:]
Trust me, we can be special tonight

[Vinz:]
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
(I want you, I want you)
Where do we go, where do we go
From hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
(I want you)
Why are you keeping me on hold
Don't wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or is it no 
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
