Catch you eye in the night, it's glowing
I'm so high and there's no controlling
In the light of the moon you're all I see
Smokey air in your skin is glossy
Cloudy minds acting like we've lost it
I'm possessed like a drug you're all I need

[Chorus:]
Cause you are burning, burning this heart of mine
You're burning, right through my veins tonight
You're in my blood
You're in my blood
You're in my blood

Shaky hands and the blood is rushing
Skin to skin and our lips are touching
As we move like a dance, just flawlessly
And your breath makes it sound like music
Round and round as the walls are moving
You become what I am, you're what I bleed

[Chorus x2]
