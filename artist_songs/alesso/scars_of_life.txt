I think scars are beautiful
I think black is white
I'm stuck between the hell I'm in and where we lie

You say that this could kill you
Your words cut like a knife
We are the beautiful mistake
That I can't fight.

So I...I...I
I don't care if it kills me tonight...
Cause I...I...I
I'll be loving these scars for life...

And I...I...I
I don't care if it kills me tonight
Cause I...I...I
I'll be loving these scars for life...

[Repeat]
