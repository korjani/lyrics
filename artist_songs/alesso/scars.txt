[Ryan Tedder:]
I think scars are beautiful, I think black is white
I'm stuck between the Hell I'm in and where we lay
You say that this could kill you, your words cut like a knife
We are the beautiful mistake that I can't find

[Chorus - Ryan Tedder:]
So I, I, I don't care if it kills me tonight
Cause I, I, I'll be loving these scars for life!
And I, I, I don't care if it kills me tonight
Cause I, I, I, I'll be loving these scars for life!

[Ryan Tedder:]
I think that we are chemicals, I think the dark is light
And I know each and every wrong you right
You say that this could kill you, your words cut like a knife
And we are the beautiful mistake that I can't find

[Chorus x2]
