You're always on my mind [4x]

[Verse 1]
[Coko] 
Boy, I can't seem to get you outta my head 
But there's something about you that makes me smile 
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel 
Can we take our time and do this for a while 
[Brian Morgan] 
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me 
Now, you're the only one I want in my life 
And the special touch you give comes from you only 
I guess that's why you're always on my mind 

[Chorus]
You're always on my mind 
You're always on my mind 
You're always on my mind 
You're always on my mind 

[Verse 2]
[Coko] 
Sometimes, I find it hard to concentrate 
Because thoughts of us together fill my head 
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night 
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight 
[Brian Morgan] 
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me 
Now, you're the only one I want in my life 
And the special tough you give comes from you only 
I guess that's why you're always on my mind 

[Chorus]

[Bridge 4x]
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya, I can't stop thinking 'bout ya 
(On my mind) 

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
