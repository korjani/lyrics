Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just

[CHORUS]
Rain down (on) on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me
Just rain down (on) on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Full as a dam at capacity
My passion's about to explode, yeah
I can't escape, it's surrounding me
I'm caught in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from

[CHORUS]

Shower me
Sprinkle me
Fall down on me
(Your love just falls on me)

Fall down, fall down on me
Let it
Fall down, fall on me
Just
[CHORUS]
