[Verse 1]
Boy, there you go 
You're telling me that you love me 
But boy you know 
That you belong to another girl who loves you 
You are so fine, (so fine, so fine) 
You blow my mind 
(Things you do) with the things you do to me 
(She sees) She's not blind, she's not blind 
Things you do for me, but I know 

[Chorus]
I'm so into you 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Boy, you got me so confused 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 

[Verse2]
Friends ask how could 
I give myself 
To one who belongs to someone else. They just don't know 
Your love's so good 
That they would want it for themselves 
Anyone can see.. 
You are so fine, (so fine, so fine) 
You blow my mind 
(Things you do) with the things you do to me 
(She sees) She's not blind, she's not blind 
Things you do for me, but I know 

[Chorus 2x]

[Repeat 3x]
You're not, you're not mine 

Ooh, what am I supposed to do 

[Chorus Until Fade...]
