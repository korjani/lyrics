There is nothing I wouldn't do
For you (All that you want, all be all that you need)
'Cause boy, you know (You got me)
And I'll do
Anything

[CHORUS:]
Anything you wanna do
I am gonna try to
Boy, my body's just for you
Pleasure is the destination
You can drive us if you choose to

[repeat w/ ad-libs till end]
