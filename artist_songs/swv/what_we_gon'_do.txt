We might be too good
Might be too right
Even got them complimentary Zodiac signs
Aesthetically, a sight to see
But somethin' 'bout our love
Don't seem to be enough
And

What do we do
When somethin' so beautiful
Starts fadin'
Slammin' the doors
And throwin' down chairs
I think I know exactly what we're faced with

Oh, can't sleep at night
Thinkin' 'bout ya got me goin' crazy
Look at how you made me
Boy, you used to hold me tight
Now you're actin' like you don't know me
Baby, won't you tell me
Yeah
What we gon' do
When the battle gets here?
Whenever you go left
We keep on losin'
(Losin')
If it ain't right then we need to let it go
What we gon' do?
What we gon' do?
What we gon' do?

We made mistakes
But every time we fuss, boy
I can see us slowly starting to break
No compromise, didn't realize
This world of strains was wearin' us thin
Oh

What do we do when something so beautiful
Starts fadin'?
Slammin' the doors
And throwin' down chairs
I think I know exactly what we're faced with

Boy, I can't sleep at night
Thinkin' 'bout ya got me goin' crazy
Look at how you made me, yeah
Boy, you used to hold me tight
Now you're actin' like you don't know me
Baby, won't you tell me
Yeah
What we gon' do
When the battle gets here?
Whenever you go left
We keep on losin'
Oooh
If it ain't right then we need to let it go
(Go)
What we gon' do?
(Do)
What we gon' do?
(Do)
What we gon' do?

Boy, you got me holdin' on for dear life
I want to make it
But the both of us have got to try
We keep trippin' and shootin' at each other's heads
Yeah
We're on the same team
We're just so in love together
So you better keep the magic
Before it gets tragic
I ain't got no time for mistakes
Better fix it before it breaks
Yeah, yeah

What we gon' do?
Hey, what we gon' do?
What we gon' do?

Boy, I can't sleep at night
Thinkin' 'bout ya got me goin' crazy
(Crazy)
Look at how you made me, yeah
(How you made me)
Boy, you used to hold me tight
Now you're actin' like you don't know me
Baby, won't you tell me
(Won't you tell me?)
What we gon' do
When the battle gets here?
(Hey)
Whenever you go left
We keep on losin'
(Losin')
If it ain't right then we need to let it go
(Let it go)
What we gon' do?
(Oh)
What we gon' do?
(Oh)
What we gon' do?

Oooh
Oh
We need to let it go
If it ain't gonna work, baby
Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby, what we gon' do?
What we gon' do?
What we gon' do?
