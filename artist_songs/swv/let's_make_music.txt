Let's make music
You're my DJ
So let it replay
Then make babies
Spin me 'round like a record, baby
Tonight I will be your favorite song
Baby, play me all night long
(Night long)
Boy, let's make sweet love
So, DJ, turn me up

I remember that night
When you caught my eye
I heard love's melody
It blew my mind
It sounded like bump and grind
So [?]
Like when I first heard summer rain fall
The very first time

So climb your way up
It's 'bout to go down
(Down)
We already sippin'
(Sippin')
It's time to get loud
(Loud)
Put your hands in the air
(Air, air)
Take me all the way there
Nobody else here
(Here)
So party with me
(Me)
It's a quarter to 11
(11)
So what it's gonna be?
(Be)
Plus, I wanna fast forward to
The part where it's me on you

Let's make music
You're my DJ
So let it replay
Then make babies
Spin me 'round like a record, baby
Tonight I will be your favorite song
Baby, play me all night long
(Baby, play me all night long)
Boy, let's make sweet love
So, DJ, turn me up

Let's remember tonight
Want you to keep me on your mind
Like a melody
On piano key
Baby, give me your slow jam
(Slow jam)
We'll be body rockin', knockin' boots
And all that
Like when I heard computer love
For the very first time

So climb your way up
It's 'bout to go down
(Down)
We already sippin'
(Sippin')
It's gonna get loud
(Loud)
Put your hands in the air
(Air, air)
Take me all the way there
Nobody else here
(Here)
So party with me
(Me)
It's a quarter to 11
(11)
So what it's gonna be?
(Be)
Plus, I wanna fast forward to
(Forward to)
The part where it's me on you

Let's make music
You're my DJ
So let it replay
Then make babies
Spin me 'round like a record, baby
Tonight I will be your favorite song
Baby, play me all night long
(Baby, play me all night long)
Boy, let's make sweet love
(Boy, let's make sweet love)
So, DJ, turn me up
(Baby, baby)
Let's make music
You're my DJ
So let it replay
Then make babies
(Let's make babies)
Spin me 'round like a record, baby
Tonight I will be your favorite song
(Be your favorite song)
Baby, play me all night long
(Yeah, night long)
Boy, let's make sweet love
(Makin' love, baby, make love, so DJ turn up for me)
So, DJ, turn me up
