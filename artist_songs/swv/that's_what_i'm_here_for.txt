I wanna be there for you 
Will you be there for me 
That's what I'm here for 
That's what I live for 
That's what I give for 
I wanna be there for you will you be there for me, for me 

[Verse:]
You should know by now how I feel 
That my love is real 
Feels secure knowing 
You've got my heart in away 
I can never stray 
But now people talk 
They say our love won't last (love won't last) 
They say my love for you 
Soon it will (past) 
But you should no for sure 
I will never leave, you're all the man I need 
I hope you see 

[Chorus:]
That's what I'm here for 
Giving you all of my love 
That's what I live for 
To be the only one you dream of 
That's what I give for 
All that I have 
I wanna be there for you will you be there for me, for me 

[Verse:]
I'll be here to give you what you need 
You can count on me - baby 
Feels secure knowing 
You've got my heart in a way 
I can never stray 
But now people talk 
They say our love won't last (love won't last) 
They say my love for you 
Soon it will (past) 
But you should no for sure 
I will never leave, you're all the man I need 
You can believe 

[Chorus]

[Cape:]
That's what 
That's what 
That's what 
That's what 
That's what 
That's what 
(I wanna be there for you) 
(Will you be there for me - for me) 

[Rap:]
Ya so moist 
Plus you got the platinum voice 
And you fine smelling like 360 Divine 
You blow my mind away 
Tonight and forever like diamonds al right 
We tight like that 
Stress time for chillin' 
Times is short good and part 
Cause you know you're my dime 
The top illin' 
They jealous cause me you styles killin' 
Aint nothin' happenin' with that breakdown talk 
We can walk the walk and keep it real 
Like New York I'm sold up, you word up uh 
If we just show'em I'll blow'em twice 
And we'll just keep flowin' like Chardone' 
On ice as we lounge in the crib and parle' 
You know what I mean 
Not to mention your lover supreme 
Move's truly with throughout the evening 
I'm here no question as long as I'm peepin' Illtown 

[Chorus: Until Fade]
