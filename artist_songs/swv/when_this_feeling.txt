It starts with a thought of love and displace 
I hold it with hope and inside me it stays 
Then speak your reply, but smile cause I know 
Sometimes love shows in the phoniest ways

When this feeling comes over me
Will you be there
To receive and let this love breathe 
When this feeling comes over me
Will you be there
To receive and let this love breathe

Curiosity, has it's part 
Is it just my body 
Or does it include my heart 
We can't make moves until I'm sure
I've tried, but it just makes me want you more

When this feeling comes over me
Will you be there
To receive and let this love breathe 
When this feeling comes over me
Will you be there
To receive and let this love breathe

Please don't 
Please don't, don't go
Feeling takes me over 
Love like a spell
That you've got me under 
And I know as time goes - oooh
We'll grow closer 
I thought I could tell 
But still I wonde
