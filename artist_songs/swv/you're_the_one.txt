[Chorus:]
You're the one for me
You can call on me
That's all I want us to be
You're the one for me

[Verse 1]
I know that you're somebody else's guy
But these feelings that Ihave for you
I can't deny
She doesn't treat you
The way you want her to
So come on stop fronting
I wanna get with you
What you'r girl don't know won't hurt her
(Hurt her)
Anything to make this love go further

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
This can be an undercover romance
'Cause I feel like I'm the type of girl
You could give a chance
Taste and see
How good it can be
'Cause you don't have to worry (baby)
What your girl don't know won't hurt her
(Won't hurt her)
Anything to make this love go further

[Chorus]

So, what's my chance?
(I'm willing to do anything to get)
In your pants
(You don't have to worry I won't)
Say a thing
(And if she finds out I don't)
Know nothing, Oh no

[Chorus]

You're the one for me
(Ah ah ahah, ah ah ahah)
When in love you need
(Ah ah ahah, ah ah ahah)
You're the one for me
(Ah ah ahah, ah ah ahah)
When in love you need

[Chorus until end]
