I'm, I'm too sexy, check my worth
Boy, don't get your feelings hurt
Chasin' skirts, so converse
Tryna get this dairy queens to desert
Got that yummy, blaze it, blaze it
You heard mine's just more expensive
Get a ninja in my benzer
I see you and and all your friends'

And I see it in your eyes that you miss us
Pockin' SWV, now you and me
Or drive past when I say I missed us
Guess keep or can escaped us
I'm so low, gettin' flicked up
I'm singin' do you, do you, do ya?
Sing or do me, now what you boo ya

I'm feelin' myself, I know I'm fly
I'm done with the pain, doin' better things
I'm movin' on, I'm goin' out
I got plans, I got places to be

Am I the best thing ever happened to you?
I'm the best thing ever happened
My love was took for granted, now you see
I'm the best thing ever happened

I know what's your brand of girlfriend
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips
As you did with your new girl?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

I'm good right now
I wish I did, would right now
Boy, I ain't got no time, I'm a do me
I'm a dance with him
You had your chance, you slipped
I'm a 10 so go run to your 3

Am I the best thing ever happened to you?
I'm the best thing ever happened
My love was took for granted, now you see
I'm the best thing ever happened

I know what's your brand of girlfriend
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?

Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Boys, you feel alone
When you do her wrong
What you need, you can't find in another girl
Karma is a mother
And you find a lover
Oh, go to hell

Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
