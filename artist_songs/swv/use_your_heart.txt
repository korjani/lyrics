Alone
You and I intertwine
Refreshing
Conversation for the mind
As we stare
We both seek and hope to find
Real love
Purified

[CHORUS]
Use your heart and not your eyes
(Baby, just relax and ride)
If you got time then I got time
(Yeah, yeah)
Free your thoughts
And watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes

I sigh
As I watch you sleeping there (sleeping there)
So easily
I did things I'd never dare (never dare)
I say to myself
I'm glad that we share
Real love
Purified, oh
[CHORUS]

My goodness
How it seems like yesterday (yesterday)
She crushed you
Hurt you in the strongest way (strongest way)
You hurt so long
Reward come to those who cry
Real love
Purified

Just a second
I look at my watches dial
And you love me
pampered me like a child
As we lay
I close my eyes and I smile
At your real love
Purified

[CHORUS]
