You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me
You want me but she needs you

[Verse One: Jay-Z]

Besides this ma, come out the V-2
Keep it on the R-Kel's
Cos my girls the type who like a fight in the club
Go home and make love
Though I like the way you sex somethin'
Baby girl will wreck something
If she knew you and I were in the Lex fronting
A bottle of Cru, the crews about to make moves
Rendevousing, hotel day doing
Lover forget then fled the scene
Smelling like wet dreams, lipstick around the collar
Thinking about bed-screams and the way you holla
Boo, you make a nigga rise like tax on the dollar
No, you ain't no trick
Can't play you like a zero
Gave you a couple of chips for spending time with the hero
To the next time baby girl, never forget
You can't be with the one you love, love the one you with
I'm knowing...

You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me

[Verse Two: Lost Boyz]

Now I know it seems strange because I just met ya
But on the low, before we spoke, I was out to get ya
Matter of fact I heard you had a man, but that I understand
Now if you seperate, now dig this, I'm your biggest fan
Besides, everything you said is stuck in my head
So come inside my spa room and lay me close to bed 
And let me bless you with the butters that's from the gutters
Don't let anybody blow the spot up, we got others
That's on the low, the home that we there for
You know that sparks turn to flames girl so therefore
We must creep and keep it tight, and do it right
My chick would die if she knew how we screw at night
So let's keep it on the low, so no-one else can know
And you could wreck them in the swerve game, fast low
And even though we creeping, I've begun to see
That I'm the one for you and shorty, your the one for me

You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me

You're the one
You're the one for me

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]

Yo, and if you ain't the bangest chick I ever saw
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
From the ceiling to the floor
I look from top to bottom
Analyse the middle with your little cleavage and your drawers
Everything remains raw baby
I love the way you strut
When you walk by got a wide angle lens focused on your butt
Complection looks mixed with black and polish
Caramel, city, stacking bone naked walking tippy toe-ish
Amazing Leanne got my heart pumping
Whole entire body cocked on diesel like we running track or something
I knew that you were the one for me
Word is bond on Flipmode and S.W.V
Got the opportunity
To see how sutible and beautiful you is when you do your nails and your cuticles
Just stay sharp love, word on my son
Let it manifest for sure that you're the one

You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me

[Verse Four: Smoothe Da Hustler + Trigger Tha Gamber]

Let the sex tell, join me cause I ain't waiting for no exhale
I move on, stay fly to keep my groove on 
It's hard to walk over me so you wonder why your shoes gone
For me to leave her? Your kidding
But it was times when you had be down with the fo-pound that she didn't
You saw me hittin, that's why you eying me
I know you love me thuggin' it
I peeped it written it in your diary
In red, God bless my soul regardless, the heartless and cold
She gonna be the one
I ain't lyin'
I told you, when my girl ain't around I mould you
Shape you into my queen, just to hold you
We won't expose you, keep it D.L like R.Kelly
With Smoothe Da Huster, a Nexx Level G across ya belly
Nexx Level, Brooklyn Brown Ville - Mr Trigger
Aced, lost, like vigga, that same dime-pieced getter
You're The One - Allstar Remix
With Lelee, Coko and Taj
My three gold card international enterage

You're the one, I know
That you're the one for me
When in need, you know
That you can call on me
Baby, I know that you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one for me
