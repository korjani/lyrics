Wake up and think of you like damn
What the hell have you done to me now
Have you seen yourself in the mirror
Shake my head and look at you
Perfect picture, perfect picture
Them other girls they want the pearls
But fly away, fly away
That baby, that baby, I been on you lately

[2x]
You shot me down
I go bang, bang
You ain't know you got me
You give me butterflies
(inside, inside, inside)

They say
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday

You got exactly what I need
You know, I want you
(Want you, want you, want you, baby boy, yeah)
Looking at your pictures
Wishing I could be with you (with you, with you, baby)
Tell me how long I have to wait
Baby, make no mistake

You shot me down
I go bang, bang
You ain't know you got me
You give me butterflies
(inside, inside, inside)

You shot me down
I go bang, bang (oh, you shot me down)
You ain't know you got me (left me for dead)
You give me butterflies (inside, inside, doo, doo, doo, doh)
(inside, inside, inside)

They say
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way (way)
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday (everyday)

Who got you feeling this way

I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday (So tell 'em I gotta MCM)
Man crush everyday (I gotta MCE oh)

That's my baby (that's my baby), everyday
Even though I've never seen him face to face
Love Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday (everyday)
That's about a week to keep that boy
You give me butterflies
You must be a caterpillar
Liking your IG pictures
But I just can't wait to see you
I don't see nobody
I'm Stevie up on the ground
My girls like hot damn
You love 'em like that's your man

They say
Who got you feeling this way
(who got you feeling this way)
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday

Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
