Oh I
Still can't believe that you're gone
It, was suppose to be forever you and me
Still got your number in my phone
I'm just hoping it will ring
Maybe it's a dream
Oh I
Still smell the scent of your cologne
I can feel you holding me
Even hear you breathe
Wish I could see where we went wrong
Cause I felt what we had was so strong

But they say when you love something
Let it go
If they really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
It'll come back to you
Miss you, miss you, miss you
They say when you love something
Let it go
If they really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
I hope you come back to me, cause I
Miss you, miss you, miss you

Oh I
And I'm going through pictures
That we took
And it's so crazy
Cause I really miss your smile
Remember the dinner that you cooked
We just laughed until we cried
But we really tried
I was never first in your book
Your hustle was your wife
I was on the side
And I tried to ignore it in my look
Cause it would hurt too much
When I would

They say when you love something
Let it go
If it really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
I hope you come back to you, cause I
Miss you, miss you, miss you
They say when you love something
Let it go
If it really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
I hope you come back to me, cause I
Miss you, miss you, miss you

I can't sleep if you ain't right beside me
Can't breathe if you ain't here
No baby (no oh, no oh)
Ain't me if you ain't here, no baby
So gone without you I'll go crazy
Ooh cause I miss you

But they say when you love something
Let it go
If they really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
It'll come back to you
Miss you, miss you, miss you
They say when you love something
Let it go
If it really loved you
Then you would know
Cause it'll come back
I hope you come back to me, cause I
Miss you, miss you, miss you

Love let it go
Love you would know
Come back, come back to
Miss you, miss you, miss you
