Give It Up
SWV featuring Lil' Kim

Say what?

Check it out

[Lil' Kim]
Pop corks with the best of them, style on the rest of them
All because I threw my breast to them
Now they zest and caressin' them, Kim neva stressin' them
Five figures, bet I'm pressin' them
This goes out to my thoroughbreds
Real dogs while ya halfway cats play the back
If ya gizzat, like dizzat
Ask Mark Morrison, it's Return Of The mizzack

[Taj]
I don't wanna hear it
All the things you said to me
About the way you do me
About the way you make me scream
Words could never put it
Those are just a waste of time
So hit me with your best shot
I wonder can you blow my mind

[bridge:]
No need to make me feel like I want a Casonova
(you got to satisfy me)
So baby what's the deal, cuz I'm curious
About the baby

[chorus:]
I wanna know it, baby
You got to show it boy
Give it up!
Don't talk about it
Give it up!
Just do it boy
Never believin' baby
Til I can see it boy
Give it up!
You got me thinkin'
Give it up!
Your just pretending

[Taj]
Honey I've been waiting
And I'm not waiting anymore
All the anticipating
So baby won't you close the door
Enough hesitating
So why don't you try change your mind
Cuz I've been waiting long boy
We gonna have a real good time

[bridge:]

[chorus:]

[Lil' Kim]
When I met ya, I swore that I would never forget ya
Scared thinkin' I won't let ya
Lick my back up and sniff my crack up
Then I slacked up, you know niggaz can act up
Before they get the booty, then I stay like Tootie
Usually I, know the truthfully I
Don't mind if you wanna get a little Into Me like SWV
Stop frontin', can we do a little sumthin'
Word to my man Max, push the fifth track in the Bently
Watch me, go dat gently, but simply
Ya'll men be, Wasting My Time like Mona Lisa, put that on my Visa
Make you sit calm like Monesha, talking greasy but I talk greasier
So Tim man slide so you can make it fit a little easier

[chorus]
