Baby baby oh [x2]

The way I get love for you is non stop
There’s too many men you put me on top
And when I’m hungry you give the boy chop
I go sing for you girl as soon as the beat drop
You must be a producer my heart beat
I feel like the house and you’s the concrete
Omo you de make this boy complete
Me you harmonise you make my soul sweet

I de sing this song
I’m singing this song
I no mind to de look your face like all night long (all night long)
Cause you make me de high high high
I’m feeling its comf
Omoge I de gbadun your style, my number one (you’re my number one)
Anytime you need me there I’m ready to cum (pun intended) 

Baby baby baby o baby o (my baby) [x2]

Say my baby fine
I go make am mine
She de blow my mind
Only na all the time
Say my baby fine
I go make am mine
She de blow my mind
Only na all the time

Baby baby baby o baby o (my baby) [x2]

If I must die you must be my grave
If I must mad you must be my crase
If I must chop you must be my taste
Omo if I must high my must be my blaze
Wait
Occupy space, e no matter
Me I give you all of my soul on a platter
Baby you’re the prettiest and I ain't tryna flatter
If anybody come in between, I go scatter

I de sing this song
I’m singing this song
I no mind to de look your face like all night long (all night long)
Cause you make me de high high high
I’m feeling its comf
Omoge I de gbadun your style, my number one (you’re my number one)
Anytime you need me there I’m ready to come 

Baby baby baby o baby o (my baby) [x2]

My baby fine
I go make am mine
She de blow my mind
Only na all the time
My baby fine
I go make am mine
She de blow my mind
Only na all the time

Baby baby baby o baby o (my baby) [x2]
