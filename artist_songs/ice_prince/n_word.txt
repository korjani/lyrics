Everyday and anywhere I hustle, I can't afford to be cheated, nigga
I'm pissed off, and I'm angry
Oops, I don't mean it like that
When I say "pissed off, and I'm angry"
I'm talking 'bout how I bring it right back
"Oleku" to "feeling my superstar"
Jude already said who we are
Too much on my books, my nigga, my next show might be Jupiter

Chopping everyday, see my belly dey pot bigger

So when I see a hater, I don't give a fuck, nigga
Deep inside me homie, I'm taking those shots at her
Cuz' Twitter people these days connecting the dots quicker
And these days I be getting sick and retarded, nigga

Big man blowing sirens, I'm like a chinchilla
And obviously I don't give a hoot, nigga

The beat is toning down, it's a moment of truth, nigga
