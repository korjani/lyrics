Shey na wassup wassup
Na papa God put me ontop ontop
See Jehovah be my guide them I support support
So badman no need to fuck up fuck
Shey na wassup wassup
Na baba God put me ontop ontop
See Jehovah be my guide them I support support
So badman need to logoff logoff

[Ice Prince]
Choc boy, celebrating
And everyday my fanbase is elevating
Say we the best yes no debating
See badman die and we replace him
Omo right now we the main thing
We step on stage and the people fainting
They see my real colour I’m like a painting
And gone are those days we wear the same thing
No need for all the hating
The boys we salute the girls we dating
I no get time, I’m concentrating
Jehovah had me sign undertaking
Very necessary o
I’m shaking my belly o
All over your telly o
I’m blowing your stereo
Omo no de vex me
If you want to x me
Remember say your chic de for house just de text me
Chai

Badman, shut up shut up
You see me for your street make you lock up lock up

And nothing in the world fit test oh
They say Ice Prince is he the next
And Tuface tell them say yes

When you see me for your salute my rhyming
