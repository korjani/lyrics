Somebody lied, they tell me say the road to success man was easy and smooth man
Somebody lied, they tell me say everybody for Lagos de chop good food man
Somebody lied, they tell me say its all good
Now I realize say somebody lied

[Verse 1]
No be everything wey de glitter be gold
They made it sound cool when the story was told
Once upon a time, I was chilling in my street
Then I got a call and they tell me say Lagos is the shit
Walked out of school, said I must go there
If na trek them de trek, me I no care
Some people sit me down, but me I no care
Shey na Lagos them de blow, I go end there
I took the night bus, cause me I had hope
And back home I was sad me and my dad broke
If na hunger we go fight, I go try cope
Me I go wash them eye till them go cry soap

Yeah, omo Lagos is calling
I hear say them get money, omo no dulling
Even if na mami water de, I go fall in
Cause where me I de, delay is not something

[Bridge]
Somebody lied, they tell me say since ’99 light go plenty
Somebody lied, they tell me say my people belle them no go empty
Somebody lied, them tell me say its all good, now I realise say somebody lied
Somebody lied o, somebody lied

[Verse 2]
They me ’99 that everything go nice
The cake is very big and omo you can have a bite
You put me in the office and the I’ll do you right
Omo you won’t have to rhyme everyday and night
And so we vote them
Them no promote us
We no de facebook
But them de poke us
We try to hang in there
But them de choke us
Them de build house for sky
And we de live for low cost
Everyday for news there’s nothing new
Oil rig stations still we just de queue
They say we get money but man its just a few
Omo boys still de feed on rice with no stew
And after school sef, omo na house work
And you go go six feet if your mouth talk
Up till now some people still de sleep for outdoor
You know the rest I don’t need to talk them some more

[Bridge]
Somebody lied, they tell me say you no go blow if you no be Yoruba man
Somebody lied, they tell me say you come from Jos and you no go go far man
Somebody lied, they tell me say my guy you no fit compete man
Somebody lied oh
Somebody lied

[Verse 3]
Are you from J-Town, omo forget rap
You ain’t got a chance out there with your dead crap
You don’t even dress fly to begin with
You far from the best you ain’t gon start with your English
You say you spit well
Oh please nigga
In Lagos you can’t compete with the gees nigga
Your bank account’s gotta have a lot of six figures
And when you’re out there you gon be a diss figure
I ain’t trying to diss you, its only true saying
This no be mouth wash, I no be toothpaste
You can’t fly there’s no gucci in your suitcase
You wan stay Lagos, omo in whose place
Celebrity ko, celebrity ni
You wey no fit pay your electricity fee
Better go school before you go become tout
Cause guy you no go blow even with bomb for your dumb mouth

Somebody lied [x3]
