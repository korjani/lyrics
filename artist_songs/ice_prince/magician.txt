Magician [x3]

[Ice Prince]
So let me do you like a magician
Your big bum I kick like a Chinese man
You drop bomb like a Pakistan
And your body sing song like an artist man
You make the girls keep malice man
Me I wan put my pen in your office man
You too fine and you perfect man
You the star, I roll up the carpet man

[J-Milla]
This is from the window to the wall
Me I tamper easy like mall
Me I rate higher than R
She a rude girl so me no fit to dull

[Ice Prince]
The way you stick na you tattoo this
And if it gonna end I’ll part two this
Nobody be there now ama rap to this
Ama be your pared* like the R2Bee
You too deep like the ocean
And your body too smooth like a lotion
Say, I want a piece of that potion
Baby girl I wanna put my emotion

[J-Milla]
Girl you hotter than hell fire
Burning up you raise up me temper
Go down let me put you some pull order
Back it up let me zoom like the yamaha

[Ice Prince]
You too fine and you perfect man
You the star, I roll up the carpet man

Say, you make brain pop champagne
Girl ama vote for you like campaign
You not cheap, not plantain
You make a nigga feel fool like a canteen
The way you inter me lan
The way you say ice man you be the man
If I be the house omo, you be the man
And when I feel the heat na you be the man

[Hook - J-Milla]

[Ice Prince]

You see me ama drop this
And ama step into the club with enough chicks
And ama bone my face like am upset
And if you try me ama lock you like a concrete

And baby girl I can give all the love tips
And no guy get you higher above this
Ima take you high high high to my upstairs
