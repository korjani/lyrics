[Hook]
I think I see myself oo [x8]
I think I see myself, I’m not ready to let go
I think I see myself, even if they break my leg o, I’m not ready to let go

I think I see myself oo [x8]
I think I see myself, I’m not ready to let go
I think I see myself, even if they break my leg o, I’m not ready to let go

[Verse 1]
Okay lights on me
Is really really true
Is it me I see
Or a deja vu

See me on stage
And you over there
Spitting my rage and you’re looking like yeah
Feels like I’m dreaming, the meaning is hidden
Cameras film in the roles I be leading
Put me on stage to recite what I’m reading
Ima kill it proper like Cain after Eden
Ima kill more, I don’t see me quitting
I don’t eat beef so I ain't bullshitting
Wow wow wow
I just hit it hard like pow pow pow
Brand new car, brand new address
Brand new everything, brand new stress
Brand new album, brand new critics
That’s what you get when you spit those lyrics
The sky’s turned day, night turned day
Dudes kept coming when their lives turned gay
I just got a babe, life feels good
Body guards everywhere, I ain't that prude
I ain't that dude who’s next on the list
You can’t tell me nothing unless its about kicks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I wanna inspire somebody
To be the best I gotta retire somebody
Or better still I gotta admire somebody
Cos then I got a guy, Halleluiah somebody
Church, more
Activated
I’m a bloody prick, I just got castrated
We pop champagne on the best at haters
On to the next last chapter is rated
I may never give up this life that I live
Where I’m at now takes lot to achieve
First single, number one for real
Performed over a million for real
Collect the show’s biz, oh yeah for real
You think I’m gonna let it disappear for real
Na
Not me, not ever in this lifetime
Can never me, I forever let the light shine

[Hook]
