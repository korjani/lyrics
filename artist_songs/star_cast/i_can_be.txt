Who shot ya?
Who knocked ya?
Point 'em out, let 'em know I'm coming for 'em
Who said that?
What hoodrat?
Grab my coat, girl ima 'bout to clapback

Ima knock 'em down like Muhammad Ali
Dropping like flies when I sting 'em with a bee
So who shot ya? 'cause I got ya
I won't let another ever run up on ya
For better or worse
Through thick and through thin
I'm going all in, I'm putting you first
It's what you deserve
Let me hold this down 'cause you know I got ya

I can be a soldier, I can be a king
I can be your president, gangsta on the scene
I can be your hip hop bulletproof vest
I can be the tattoo bleeding on your chest
[x2]
(I can be that, I can- I can be that...)

Ima rain down like a fireball 
Ima make your jaw drop, give you more 
Ima supergirl when your rocket falls, when your rocket falls, when your rocket falls

Who shot ya?
Who knocked ya?
Point 'em out, let 'em know I'm coming for 'em
Who said that?
What hoodrat?
Grab my coat, girl ima 'bout to clapback

I can be a soldier, I can be a king
I can be your president, gangsta on the scene
I can be your hip hop bulletproof vest
I can be the tattoo bleeding on your chest
[x2]

(I can- I can be that...)

Let me hold this down 'cause you know I got ya
(I got ya, I got ya, I got ya)
Let me hold this down 'cause I got ya
(I got ya, know I got ya)

I can be a soldier, I can be a king
I can be your president, gangsta on the scene
I can be your hip hop bulletproof vest
I can be the tattoo bleeding on your chest
[x2]

(I can- I can be that...)
(I'm about to clapback)
(Ima knock 'em down like Muhammad Ali)
Let me hold this down 'cause you know I got ya
Who shot ya?
