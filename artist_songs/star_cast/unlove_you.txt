Driving by the park tonight
I was stopping at the light
And you reminded me of all those days

Posted at the coffee shop
We would sit and talk for hours
Never thought in a million years things would change

Tied to my heart
Like a kite to a string
I'd follow you where the wind would blow

We were something
But you were fronting
Now I'm sitting here wishing I could get you out of my head

[Chorus:]
Baby, I tried but I can't unlove you
You know you got your hooks in my soul
Feels like I'm dying slowly all because you
And your love will never let me go

Haunted by the picture frames
I can almost touch your face
Memories can really be hell sometimes

I thought I could walk away but it ain't that easy, babe
When you're curled up and be lonely every night

We were something
But you were fronting
Now I'm sitting here wishing I could get you out of my head

[Chorus x2]

I keep turning the page
And I turn out the light
But I'm back in the same old place
A thousand and one times

Takes all the breath out of me
I just can't escape
I can't do this no more

[Chorus x2]
