Had the baddest, upped your status to a pro
Me on your arm made you a superstar (ah)
Hand in my hand transformed you to a man like damn
Everybody knowing who you are
Then you presented symptoms of brain damage
I'm convinced that you bumped your head
Let my heart slip right out of your hands
(Right out of your hands)

And now I'm frozen
Some glass should remain broken
You wanted out, you chose this
Messed round and slit your wrist
(Killed love, killed us)
And now we're frozen
Some glass should remain broken
You wanted out you chose this
Your mistakes to made you sick
(Killed love, killed us but I am...)

You say without me here your life is like a nightmare
(So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost it's rhythm cause I'm gone
(Pa ra pa pam pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding from the inside
But you made your mess, now roll in it
And the next time your heart beats
I hope it breaks yo chest

I was right there by your side just like an arm so strong
Lost me, now you're handicap
Tried to apologize but you ran out of your charm
Had the world till you fell right off the map
I'm so through with you built up my system
I'm immune, won't be a victim
Snatched my life right up out of your hands
(Up out of your hands)

You say without me here your life is like a nightmare
(So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost it's rhythm cause I'm gone
(Pa ra pa pam pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding from the inside
But you made your mess, now roll in it
And the next time your heart beats
I hope it breaks yo chest

Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, che-che-che-che-che-chest
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, breaks your, breaks - break...
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, che-che-che-che-che-chest
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest...

Oh!
I hope you can feel it
Hope it breaks you into a thousand pieces

You say without me here your life is like a nightmare
(So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost it's rhythm cause I'm gone
(Pa ra pa pam pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding from the inside
But you made your mess, now roll in it
And the next time your heart beats
I hope it breaks yo chest
[x2]

Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, che-che-che-che-che-chest
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, breaks your, breaks - break...
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, che-che-che-che-che-chest
Breaks yo chest
Che-che-che-che-che-chest-chest
Your chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest...
