You talk a good game
Say all the things that you think
Think I wanna hear, let me be clear
When it comes to help, don't trip
I can do it for ya baby and I do it for myself
Understand I don't wanna be alone
Play the back seat
Take what ya give
I just can't so I won't

Anything I want, anything I need
I'm able so as far as what I'm bringing to the table

I bring me, get mine, bout mine, go hard
Looking for another like me (boy stop)
I bring me, whose love is the tightest whose kiss is the nicest (me)
Whose touch is the rightest (me)
Bad bitch, (that's me) that bitch (that's me)
Game bitch, (that's me) lame bitch (not me)
What you get is what you see
And I bring, I bring, I bring, I bring me

Now who you thought, thought I was
Some that'll just sit around looking pretty
Not goin' be about her's
Not goin' make no fuss
Not goin' be about us
I get it if that's what you like
But I ain't 'bout that life
See I can't be something I ain't
Won't do something I can't
Yeah I'm goin' right for ya, baby
But I ain't goin' lie to ya, baby

Anything I want, anything I need
I'm able so as far as what I'm bringing to the table

I bring me, get mine, bout mine, go hard
Looking for another like me (boy stop)
I bring me, whose love is the tightest whose kiss is the nicest (me)
Whose touch is the rightest (me)
Bad bitch, (that's me) that bitch (that's me)
Game bitch, (that's me) lame bitch (not me)
What you get is what you see
And I bring, I bring, I bring, I bring me

I will never ask for nothing that I won't give in return
You will never have to question the value of my words
Cause if you had no money we would be alright
And if you had no money you would still be mine
Baby, I can give you all that you need
And as far as what I'm bringing to the table

I bring me, get mine, bout mine, go hard
Looking for another like me (boy stop)
I bring me, whose love is the tightest whose kiss is the nicest (me)
Whose touch is the rightest (me)
Bad bitch, (that's me) that bitch (that's me)
Game bitch, (that's me) lame bitch (not me)
What you get is what you see
And I bring, I bring, I bring, I bring me

I bring me
I bring me
