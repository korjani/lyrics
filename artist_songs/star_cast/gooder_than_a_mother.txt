[Miss Bruce:]
Well, all right, everybody
Let your hair down
If you got on a wig
Like some people think I got on a wig
But this is my own beautiful hair
What to do with it, fellas? Take it off

Said-a, get down, down, down, down
Ya gotta
Get down, down, down, down, down
Whoo
Yo

[Carlotta:]
It's like you got me California dreamin'
Two chicks in a corner and they feenin'
Lookin' for a quick dip in the deep end
She got a job, but she party on the weekend
A star's born in the night got her singin'
Oh, my God, give her something to believe in
Last night she had a hell of a reason
To think she the one 'cause her man had her screamin'
Stay true to myself so who are you to judge?
Worry 'bout you, why does it matter who I love?
This life feel gooder than a mother
Man, my life feel gooder than a mother

[Miss Bruce & Carlotta:]
Said-a, get down, down, down, down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down
Said-a, get down, down, down, down, down
Get down, down, down
Man, my life feel gooder than a mother
Down, down

Get down, down, down, down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down
Said-a, get down, down, down, down
Uh
Get down, down, down
Man, my life feel gooder than a mother
Down, down

[Carlotta:]
He slippin' out his clothes, tryin' to lean in
Tryin' to give your girl a kiss, get it poppin'
Won't lie, might get myself a hit in
And tell him he could keep the cash, we can be friends
Surf's up, man, I'm feelin' that wave
We chillin' like we on a long holiday, then
Close up and the memories fade
How we gon' lose? It's a win-win spin
We all got a path, they say I ain't living right
But life ain't worth living if you gotta live a lie, and
This life feel gooder than a mother
Man, my life feel gooder than a mother

[Miss Bruce & Carlotta:]
Said-a, get down, down, down, down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down
Said-a, get down, down, down, down, down
Get down, down, down
Man, my life feel gooder than a mother
Down, down

[Carlotta:]
Surf's up, man, I'm feelin' that wave
We chillin' like we on a long holiday, then
Close up and the memories fade
