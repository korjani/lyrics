Some brothers are carrying tech-nines
Some brothers are carrying mac-tens
Stop the killing, stop doing crime

From the east to the west, I give all due respect
Release the stress off your chest

On tight alright, levitate my mind
Mmm, mmm, all my people sing
If what you're looking for is real love
Then unity is what you'll
