Ah more time you done know say
Holy Mount Zion that's where the foundation build
Well traditionally you know say
Everything got to full before it spill
Selasie I, oh Lord

Well, make dem know Babylon while you spread you spill
What we don't have every ghetto youth will
Can't take our own uno better be still
And lef' and go 'cause you gonna draw nil

Eh, ey, yo while you spread you spill
What we don't have every ghetto youth will
Can't take our own uno better be still
And lef' and go 'cause you gonna draw nil
Judgment

Babylon a use dem brain
True dem waan da ghetto youth dem fi go down the drain
Babylon a use dem brain
The mark of da beast the whole ah dem a proclaim

Babylon a use dem brain
Dem only fight against herb and dem a shipping cocaine
Babylon a use dem brain
Well dem you know say bad mind dem ah go burn in tha flame

Oh, what a agony and oh what a shame
To see my black brother goin? all down the drain
Man made to suffer and woman to feel pain
Dey rape mi mommy mi sister I say oh what a shame

Brother and mi father afi chop sugar cane
Pon the plantation under stress and shame
Pon dem hand, pon dem foot I just see shackles and chains
Now dem take it off and put it pon dem brain

Through dem ah mi nation fi go down the drain
Now the youths dem realize and shout the hailie hailie name
Man no pet lion dat mean we can't tame
One thing is our desire one thing is our aim
Me say wicked Babylon and dem ah go down the drain

Babylon while you spread you spill
What we don't have every ghetto youth will
Can't take our own uno better be still
And lef' and go 'cause you gonna get nil
Judgement

Oh, what a crisis you would cry facing this
Could dem ah come with dem kit jus to take every bit
Don't tink me doh know you are the boss fi your kit
But our share you won't be living wit

I tell dem how could dem cadet go down practice
Now I see dem own face and dem own wanna vomit
Ey ey ey you've not been kind
I've put you up and now you leave us behind

Now something drop from your back
Nothing ah touch it ?cause ah mine
What's due onto us uno fi give we every time
Babylon

Babylon a use dem brain
True dem waan da ghetto youth dem fi go down the drain
Babylon a use dem brain
The mark of da beast the whole ah dem a proclaim

Babylon a use dem brain
Dem only fight against herb and dem a shipping cocaine
Babylon a use dem brain
Well, dem you know say bad mind dem ah go burn in tha flame

Well, this is one thing I cannot over stand
Dem nah teach me nothin' 'bout mi Asian plan
Inna the school and the college and the institution
The curriculum that I get is European

Ah teach me bout Marco Polo and Napoleon
Nah teach me nothin' 'bout the river Nile bank
Where civilization it began
You say thou shall not steal and should not kill no one

Still you steal treacheries and then you teach wrong
Yea, yea slave and you murder all mi dad and mi mom
But wicked Babylonian and you will love to burn
Babylon ah

Tell dem come down, fire bun all politician
Ah causin' dispute makin' us their plan
Oh your dishonesty and war is their illustration
Competin' this is more than competition

Could that dem fightin' just to enslave black man
And now dem parties just ah cause bear partition
And who is you no one takes any instruction
