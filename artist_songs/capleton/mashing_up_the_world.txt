Let Jah rise and all his enemies be scatter
Rastafari seated up in Zion
Holy Emmanuel I Selassie I Jah Rastafari the almighty No doubt

Mashin up the world out there
With them atomic energy and them nuclear
Mashin up the world out there
They own them half of the world and still want our share
Mashin up the world out there
Thats why I burn out the eagle and the dragon and the bear
Mashin up the world out there
As if they don't care

I found salvation
Through my revelation
Through the accusation

Want to mash up my nation
With dem disillusion
All frightened til the destruction
I see the whole a dem a try to shove [?] and Babylon dem a know this

Mashin up the world out there
With them atomic energy and them nuclear
Mashin up the world out there
Thats why I burn out the eagle and the dragon and the bear
Mashin up the world out there
