How you fi Ras and then you still ah eat pork?
How you fi Ras and then you still ah smoke coke?
Still all ah sail pon Babylon boat
Nuff rent-a-dread go bow pon the north coast
Bow to the Queen

Under the influence of the thing called the dope
Nuff ah take the heroine and nuff ah take coke
Everyone ah hear them note eveyone ah see them sport
Bare almshouse them come round here and support
Nuff say them ah lion but me see say them ah goat
Pass me the sword and make me chop off their throat
Nuff of dem ah hang up inna John Paul rope

[Hook 2]

Call Nyabinghi, Twelve Tribes, Orthodox
Go call the tick and put the fire pon de top
Call Bobo Shanti from the hill top
Seperate the wolf them from the sheep flock
Man ah real Congo Natty
Man ah no curly locks
Can't diss the Bobo and say the Bobo wear frock
Can't see the king if you no royal hat
Royalness haffi the royal flock
Robe and turban fi de royal flock
No Mosscini, Versace and dress like ah ass
Nuff of them ah lion but me see seh dem ah fox
Pass me the...

[Hook 1]

Eh watch out now there rude boy
Dreadie him no real
Dreadie him ah fake
Dreddie him ah lean
Him never come straight
Him don't have no love
Him only full of hate
All the wrong things ah whey him go on go perpetrate
And him never early
Always late
Can't stand up on ah Emmanuel gate
One thunder ball ah go tear off him face
Nah hail Selassie nuff ah them gone ah space
