Smoke a spliff and take a lift
Smoke a spliff and take a trip
There we just... pass me the chalice and say Shango take a sip
We goin on a high grade trip
We nah go leave we mistress
We nah go leave Don and Maris, Susette and Doris
Sometimes ah them ah carry me Cannibis
Babylon say me rude
Me say them haffi honour this

[Chorus:]
We planting acres and acres
So me tell the youth and say fi plant up the whole of jamaica
Acres and acres!
Make me hear it for the reapers and the buyers, and the cultivators
Acres and acres!
Have love inna me heart for the weed, me have to burn the haters
Acres and acres!
We spell it with a G-A-N and call it GAN-JAmaica

So me tell babylon say no fi touch me grown
And me tell the wicked man say no fi cut it down
Me never come up ah your place and try fi shut it down
And never use my bulldozer and try fi buck it down
Me tell the youth them bring some weed and "couchie come"
And tell them bring some more food and me "couchie come"
I say them want me weed ground

Me prefer plant the weed than fi go bust me gun

[Chorus]

Yo again ah bigger jugement!

Wowowowowowo me ah fly the next jump

Nah swap it fi no henessy nah swap it fi no rum
Nah swap it fi no bullet, nah swap it fi no gun

Ah that me smoke, ah no joke, me nah take no coke
Ah that me smoke, COUGH make you choke
Ah that me smoke, ah no joke, me nah take no dope

[Chorus]

People want change so them sent fi obama
