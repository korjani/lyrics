They will never share
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woy
And they will never care
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woy
And they will never have
That's why I have to burn dem blaze dem woy
And I will never swear
But I will still burn dem

Aright mi tell dem seh

Yo Babylon a tell weh mouth dem care bout we life style
And a tell weh seh dem a plans fi reach I
Both everything pretty and a dem alone a smile
Seh dem a fight ova you reign you [?]
A waan di people blood fi run like a oil
Don't mek dem press you head and send you fi miles
This selassie I mi nah go lock dem style
A we alone a work and we alone a tile
And dem alone seet pon nah spend nah lot de coil
But mek sure you don't have no plan for mi nail
And mek sure you don't wann fi destroy the soil
And put inna di lake a fiyah tell you seh fi bwoyyy

They will never share
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woyyy
And they will never care
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woyyy
And they will never have
An I have to burn dem blaze dem woyyy
And they will never care
But I still a burn dem burn dem woyyy

Mi haffi bun dem up

A send dem wholla dem fi go live up alright
So dem a prepare di youth dem table and dem alone a eat

Tell di youth dem no give no trouble still dem send dem
Go rule

Neva waan dem fi die whey a send dem go intrude
While hate dem with di key waan fi turn dem a inna tube
Tun di woman and across??

Dem diss emmanuel a judgement mi include
Rastafari seh the wicked man cyaan walk in our shoes
Now mek dem know this

They will never care
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woy
They will never share
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woy
I know they never care
That's why I have to burn dem blaze dem woy
And they will never have
That's why I have to burn dem burn dem woy

But I will never seet and will never stop
From blazin' this fiyah a red hot now
Babylon
