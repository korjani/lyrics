Di eagle all a fly a look somewhere fi pitch
And a more fire di dragon caan spit
Mi nuh know weh tek di bear but him skin start drip
That's why mi put da fire pon buckingham palace

Weh dem a go tell mi seh now

Never been heard or haven been seen
Guilty conscience are you free never been heard
