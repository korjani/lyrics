Oh from the first that the line got drawn
It was poisoning the land it was on
One red thread through the middle of a song
My only one, my only one

I can remember the age that I was
But not that story that pumped in my blood
When you were the savior
And I was the taker of
Oh where I was

Oh but man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're from

I have to say there was a mile or two
I had the itch to fly and I flew
Now at best we would make our dreams 
With something used
With something used

From the minute that the line got drawn
I couldn't see straight to you for nothing
Now me, I'm the poisoning one
Yeah I'm the one
I am the...

Oh but man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're-
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
Oh man, oh man, you can do what you want
The only line that is true is the line you're from
The only line that is true is the line you're from
