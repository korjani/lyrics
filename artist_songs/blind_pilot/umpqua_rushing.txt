Panic in the first beat of the morning
Even what I've got isn't worth offering 
Even faces change - my heart stays the same

Engine in the sky won't let the moment go
Following behind always a second slow
If I'm far away, am I hearing straight - I'm no voice you want to know?

You've been a forest burning no direction
Caught me sleeping smoke in my protection
Your blackened branches drifting through my water -
Are you wrapped up in his arms? I'm rushing faster and faster

Panic in the taste of all that could have been
Even what I thought wasn't worth giving
At least my mind has changed

I've been a forest burning no direction
I tried to hold you, I tried everything but running
My heart is panicking - are you kissing him?
Are you reaching through all your days with him?
Your blackened branches drifting through my water -
Are you over me? Are you are you are
I will not hold you. I will not feel your sway
I will not miss you. I will not think each day
Of summer twilight, your eyes rushing through me deep
I saw my own waters rushing right back to me -
You sitting shotgun, the lost coast calling me
Umpqua Forest, your face just like in my dream

Are you are you are [x6]
