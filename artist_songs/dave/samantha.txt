I changed my number couple times cuh' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster

[J Hus:]
Quickly stop off at the off-licence
Bossman, let me get a two two drink
Gyaldem ah' watch my 'ting
How 'bout a crook and a princess combining
And I've been givin' gyal the good pipe
And man walked in, yo, it's not what it looks like
Give man high five, kiss her goodnight
I'm in your eyesight
But I'm not your type, I'm more like low life
Keep quiet, I'm preaching
Put a sock in it, put a sock on the fire alarm
Fingers lookin' like a fire arm
Well I spit this fire
Plus I came with the fire
Um, what's that ting with the silencer?
Man come through and silence 'em
I was never the cool kid
More like strange and awkward
Biscuit for your forehead
Tore my forearms exhausted
I been road my fortress
Spent four months in the forefront
We party for a fortnight
But I was too weak by the fourth night

We are not Gs, I am not from your ends
I don't give a fuck what you done
Two young Gs, arms out, nobody move, you can get stuck in the mud
We sent your man to the shop
What do you mean? He ain't ever made it rain
Your man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie
You're kinda like Rachel Zane
I'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem
But I'm gangster with some voddy and voss
My girl don't wanna stop for a chat
Then I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross
Babe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?
It's calm, you don't even know what you lost
Stone Island from my head to my feet
When I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but
I know it's expensive
She told me she love me but really I don't even know if she meant it
And if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences
Why you gassed off a rack?
I put three on my dentins, I put three on my dentins

[J Hus:]
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing
