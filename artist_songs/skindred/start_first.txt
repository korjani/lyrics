Now what's done in the dark must come to light
And some of them ah big up themselves
And ah grown with the badness
Jah know dat no right
You done know you ah fe come again
And renew your sight
In this time of fighting and confusion
Youth and youth dem just caught in pollution
Bear destruction it runs through the nations
Building walls constructing segregation
Time to cool yourself, just cool yourself
We should live in love and health
Uno we start; ah dem start first
Well one of you better give because
The time is gunner get worst
Uno we start first, ah dem start first
And can't you live together?
Its like we're all under a curse
Uno we start first, ah dem start first
Well hell is getting hot and into flames its gunner burst
Uno we start first, ah dem start first
And for a little peace you know
The righteous dem ah thirst
Revelation you know that it's dawning
Jerusalem, God's time piece in the mourning
Time to wake up and takeoff your make up
Oh ye son and daughter of Jacob
Time to cool yourself, just cool yourself
We should live in love and health
Calling out to all who hear me? Can't we live in peace?
In this time man ah shot and ah murder
How much more, can we take it much further?
Start first, start first
Well one of you better give because its gunner get worst
Me say start first, start first
Hell is getting hot and into flames its gunner!
Uno we start first, dem start first
For a little peace you know the righteous dem ah!
Uno we start first ah dem start first
Hell is getting hot and in to flames is gunner burst
Co we say
Start first, second, third, fourth, fifth, Last.
