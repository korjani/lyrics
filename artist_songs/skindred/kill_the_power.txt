This is a resident evil attack. 
Zombie take over, boy watch your back. 
Infected disease, unprotected.
Soul catcher, listen, everybody dress black. 
Goods are as evil, evil's as worse. 
Words for fella man, words verse curse. 
Don't fuck with we, somebody body wanna fuck with we, 
an itchy itchy bombs gang.

No retreating, no surrender. 
Mash the man with the heavyweight sound.

Boy stop top, you musta head fuck. 
Everything you ever so you know it is a lie. 
We're not listening to bootshit, no. 
Your breath smells like bati, so go. 
Move on over we tell ya, once before. 
So rude boy, fooled boy, move from me dollar. 
Don't fuck with we. 
Somebody body wanna fuck with we, an itchy itchy bombs gang.

We running it, gunning it. 
You know you can't kill the power.

You know you can't kill the power. 
You keep on running but you just can't hide, kill the power. 
You keep on running but you know you can't hide. 
Can't kill the power.

Ain't no killing what cannot be killed. 
I'm not joking, the blood gets spilled. 
Rewind, select, I bomb shaka lick. 
Even salt boy suck my dick. 
Drop down, roll on, good bye, so long. 
Ain't no killing what cannot be killed. 
On the ground you're gonna stay long. 
That's the way symmetry gets field.

No retreating, no surrender. 
Mash the man with the every which sound.
