All I want to do is make the people rock
But them I heard dem der words
I never trusted you lot
And why don't you go back to Africa
From I heard that sound these a vibe non-stop, right?
Round 1, i'll tie you up in knots
You caught me with a right, is that all you got?
Let's make our way to the parking lot
Coz I know one of us have got to drop
Winners losers mind confuser
Step in the ring and you know get bruises
Winners losers mind confuser
Jump inna de ring and you know you get bruises
Winners losers mind confuser
People should know better
It's not hard or it's not clever
Dem ah walk in a drunkard crew
And dem are look violence
Through intoxication
They want to start a confrontation
But they ain't got the sense or co-ordination
Who you looking at? For pray clowns be storking
All liquored up, pay no mind keep walking
Wrong move there in your face for a fight
To explode with a right upper cut dynamite
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
Winners losers mind confuser
Jump in the ring and you know get bruises
Winners losers mind confuser
Jump inna de ring and you know you get bruises
Winners losers mind confuser
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
He's had enuff he ain't getting up
Winners losers mind confuser
Step in the ring and you know get bruises
Winners losers mind confuser
Jump inna de ring and you know you get bruises
