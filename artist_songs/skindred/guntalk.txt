Guns are blazing, like in the old wild west.
Youths are saving up to buy a bullet proof vest.
Watch the bad mans, dem no care about you.
Quick to draw a gun and that's the end of your crew.
This is crazy, how they want to live.
Everybody wants revenge and no-one wants to forgive.
For territory, they will end your life.
There's so much drama, daily strife!

Every day another shot goes bang.
You've got to know, and got to understand.
Every day another youth gets drop.
And I and I we just ain't down with that.

Now everyday you see the sun come up.
Another chance to go and show some love.
And everyday another youth gets drop.
And I and I we just ain't down with that.

Oh yeah.

Every day another shot goes bang.
Every day another youth gets drop.
Every day another shot goes bang.
Every day another youth gets drop.
Every day another shot goes bang.
Every day another youth gets drop.
