Caught in chains,
Shackles on too tight.
Squirming for your life
because you've gone and lost your freedom.

Manacles cut deep when they're too tight,
You have to break the lock or find the key so you can defeat dem.
Enslaved by the wickedest power,
We're smashing up the cells and all the right ones gunna follow.
Uprising - we need not the chains,
And we aren't gunna make the same mistakes again.

If you want it you got to rise and take it,
You go to wake up you know you can't contain this.
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.

If you want it you got to fight for it,
Wake up you'll never contain it.
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.

Wolves they creep,
Out to take the sheep.
The vulnerable, the easy led, the weak,
Who will protect dem?

Against the wall - now they execute.
The blind can't lead the blind,
They always need someone to lead dem.

Restrained by the evillest power.
Captive of the chains because these things you've done are so'a.
Not surprising - it's all done in vain,
But you have gone and made the same mistake again

If you want it you got to rise and take it,
Got to wake up, you know you can't contain this.
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.

If you want it you got to fight for it,
Wake up you'll never contain it.
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.

Enslaved by the wickedest power,
Enslaved by the wickedest power,
Enslaved by the wickedest power,
Enslaved by the wickedest...

Everyday you live, you gotta fight,
You got to stand your ground.
If you want it you got to rise and take it,
Got to wake up, you know you can't contain this.

Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.
If you want it you got to fight for it,
Wake up you'll never contain it.

Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything.

If you don't stand for something,
You'll fall for anything...
