Know this ones dedicated to the police dem you know Liar
Cause some of them is wicked and them good for nothing
And dem love pick upon people
And dem think der no right
And I man come to show you dat
Alright alright alright alright
So we kick it up because you

So we kick it up because you know we good to go
One for the money and three for the show
Warning for you and here's a warning for me
No bodder test the beast it coulder end up nasty
Stop you on the street without a reason
Search through your pockets under suspicion
Everybody in ya is a prime suspect
Gone are the days where they serve and protect

Danger you know that the fire is burning, seen
Danger you know that the fire is burning, gworn

From I was a yoot police ah give me a hard time
They said I looking like a crook and you're destined for crime
Positive police me never met much of dem
An the one's down pill cause most the problems
Driving up and down dem ah check an dem ah stare
Look out natty dread locks you best beware
Why can't they be like the ones on the bill
Who never ever curse or they never ever kill
[Chorus]
