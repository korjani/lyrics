To many vultures buzzing round. (nan naaa na nana) 
They don't even wait see if we get in the ground. (nan naaa na nana)
They over the victim like a gun. (nan naaa na nana)
Running this world on danger signs.

It's all bittersweet.
It's all bittersweet.
Now everydays like you feeling love. 
And you just gotta let it go, Let it go.

Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!
Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!

Trying to start anew again.
Diamonds and a girl i never seen.
Heavy hearts and blistered hands.
Not even death can spoil my pain.

It's all bittersweet.
It's all bittersweet.
Now everydays like you feeling love. 
And you just gotta let it go, let it go.

Want some of that power?
Want some of that power?

Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!
Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!

[low voice singing]

Both fucked up we are breaking it!
Hands up now we are making it!
Washed up for faking it!

Walls break down we are breaking it!
Answer now we are making it!
Oooooohooooooo let it go oooooohh

Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!
Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!
Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!
Want some of that power.
Take your life, back.
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day.
Take your life!
