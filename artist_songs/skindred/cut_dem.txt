It's all in a days work, nah dem nah go learn
Dems a mercenaries, das the way dem ah fe earn
Leave your family with pain, none of the can console
Is only jah jah know when the truth will unfold
They leave me

Suffocating
Hearts stop beating
Souls you're reaping
I'm left there bleeding

Coz you got the handle and I know that, it's time to trade (Whoah)
You got the handle and I know that I'll feel the blade
Then you'll know
You'll feel it, sharper than a razors edge
I'll feel it, sharper than a razors edge
Life stolen, then you're just left for dead

You feel it's sharper than a blade, blade, blade, blade, blade, blade, blade
Sharper than a blade, blade, blade, blade, blade, blade, blade

Blood it ah run and that's the wrong way to go
Cut down to the bone, sliced to the marrow
Watch them all fall down, man, like domino
The road to destruction is well wide you know

Suffocating
Hearts stop beating
Souls you're reaping
I'm left there bleeding

Coz you got the handle and I know that, it's time to trade (Whoah)
You got the handle and I know that I'll feel the blade
Then you'll know
You'll feel it, sharper than a razors edge
I'll feel it, sharper than a razors edge
Life stolen, then you're just left for dead

You feel it's sharper than a....blade
Blade, blade, blade
Sharper than a.....blade (BLADE! BLADE!)
Blade, blade, blade

RAZOR...SHARPER THAN A RAZOR (SHARP) [X8]

You got the handle and I know that, it's time to trade (Whoah)
You got the handle and I know that I'll feel the blade
Then you'll know
You'll feel it, sharper than a razor...ah, ah, ah, ah, alright
I'll feel it, sharper than a razors edge
LIFE STOLEN, then you're just left for dead
You'll feel it, sharper than a.....blade
