Enough of them running it bow.
Enough of them running it now.
Enough of them running it bow.
Enough of them, well.

Well you know say that we come.
We come to get the job done.
We step in hot like the sun.
An while erase everyone.
I'll knock you right of your feet.
And I'll get you out of your seat.
I'll slap the black off your skin.
Don't need no reason.

Don't waste your time talking to me, I CONTROL.
Don't waste your time begging to me, I CONTROL.

Coz I'm gunner own you (Own you)
Totally control you (Own you)

Defile and disown you.

Control your soul, control your soul.
Control your soul, control your soul.

Right, this is the rise and fall.
I'll take the weak and the small.
I and I will come crush them all.
So you will hear when I call.
This is the spot, it's the place.
With all the flesh you can taste.
I'll slap the white off your skin.
Don't need no reason.

Don't waste your time talking to me, I CONTROL.
Don't waste your time begging to me, I CONTROL.

Coz I'm gunner own you, own you.
Totally control you, own you
Yes I'm gunner own you, own you
Defile and disown you.
