[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Peep it, peep it OH MY GOD!
Pe-peep these people fiending
Fiending to be seen as king and leaning in they, CHROMED OUT CARS
Ri-riding high, su-superfly wood wheel, they grasp it tight
Locomotive midnight strolling through Georgia they Gladys Knight
Tipping, neon glass is bright switches make the back take flight
Lay it down, raise it up stu-stunting gives 'em bragging rights
All this so they swag is tight idolatry for status right
But they blind to the prison and the image that they living in all this sin from Adam's vice
All of us we get this, yeah distorted views of image, yeah
Made in God's likeness but despite this mankind is blemished, yeah
So men chase them fancy cars riding on them fancy bars
All so they can get respect when we cruising down the boulevard
So I grab the mic in here just to bring some light in here
Flip-flip the script just like a switch to spark this hit bring Christ in here
Since man can't see who they should be I'm a spit this so they can see
Outside of Christ you're bound for life a slave to your Idolatry

[Hook:]
[Rap:]
Self proclaimed kings bragging cause they on chrome
But 26 inches is a pretty low throne
[Singing:]
They riding on chrome on chrome on chrome
A pretty low throne low throne low throne
On chrome on chrome on chrome
Low throne low throne low throne

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I see ya riding big, boy
Like Andre and his friend, boy
Got the SUV with the chromed out feet
And the seats is ostrich skin, boy
And naw that ain't a sin, boy
But tell me where it ends, boy
Cause the truck don't bring you luck and sho nuf ain't goin pay yo sins, boy
Gone head worship that tin toy
And in the end watch crumple like tin foil
Is that what you really wanna live for, do you read me, dawg?
Is that 10-4? You spent 10-4 for chrome, bruh
But Jesus still don't know ya
You worship that cold steel and still ya heart is colder
Can't say we ain't told ya, we told you like we s'posed to
The rims don't deserve that praise but the one who does hung like a poster
You post up on the block so the girls they flock
When they see you ridin' by, the boys see ya ridin'
High and you the one that they admire
Now if ya set jacked and crash that whip
That'll hurt you pride, yo status stripped
You thought your car could bless you like it's God
But no my father is
Idolatry it bothers Him
And when they make some hotter rims
Your gods gets rusty so you change religions like Madonna did

[Hook:]
[Rap:]
Self proclaimed kings bragging cause they on chrome
But 26 inches is a pretty low throne
[Singing:]
They riding on chrome on chrome on chrome
A pretty low throne low throne low throne
On chrome on chrome on chrome
Low throne low throne low throne

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
They look hard like OH, GOD!, and you make them they say who that?
So you look hard like you God, all the while you ain't really got a clue that
E-ve-ry-thang (thang) was made for the king of kings
True that through the only name, higher than every name
You don't get it then you maybe wanna move back
Yeah, I'm trying to tell ya mane yeah, I'm trying to warn ya dog
You can play me to the left like I'm dribbling to the right and get defensive but sin will scorn you dog
Leave you marred in your vision all scarred like incisions
Men marked like in prison that ain't all dog
Pretty soon there's an idol assuming the Lord's title
Like He's idle but He's more like a sawed-off
When it comes, to His glory
Man please believe me, BOY, He don't play that
This is more, than metaphors
Man this is the truth so baby, BOY, where your faith at
Let me help, it should be in One who provides
Better yet, the only One who could save our lives
Cause the things on this earth shouldn't be placed first
Over Him, the only One who gave us His life
But on the cool (on the cool) it ain't sin (it ain't sin), if you ride rims (ride rims) (ugh-uhh)
Make it do (make it do) what it do (what it do) but whatever you do, don't idolize them
But if you have (if you have) then repent turn back now cry out to Him
Commandment one, demands that none, be placed above this God in here
