[Intro:]
I see You're all I need Father, God I see You're all I need (All I need)
God, God you're all I need to tell the truth LORD You're all I need (All I need)

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
They said I was going crazy on the campus when You saved me
Cause I stopped partying, chasing all the ladies
And they told me I was loosing it calling me a lunatic
Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it
Man I heard the rumors calling me a joke
I'm praying saying, I wish they knew what I know
Cause if they did they would see, how you were meant to be
Much more than the god of emergencies
You're the God that elected me chose, and selected me
When nobody else would mess with me
Never neglected me you even loved me when you corrected me
Hands down you're the best to me
I spent years of my life trying to be liked or be like the people who seemed to be liked
Following the crowd, trying to be allowed Into a world where every thing seemed right
But,

[Hook: Chris Davis]
I wrote this song to tell you LORD
You're all I need (You're all I need)
(God) And I know you'll never fail me LORD You're all I need
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father
You're all I need (You're all I need)
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in around me
You're all I need (You're all I need, You're all I need)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
From saving me to raising me, shaping me and changing me
Embracing me, taking me, making me yours
Amazingly and graciously when I was lost and wavering
Couldn't get from A to B you opened the door
I deserved to be left there in distress with the rest there
Right there in my mess yeah
Still believing all the lies the world can satisfy
I almost died, pushing you to the side
What a fool, making crazy moves about to lose, all I had for a buzz and a thrill
We too easily satisfied and that's just how Adam died, He was in the place where the love wasn't real
But the more I get to know You the more I get to know truth
And through you I see who I am
My identity revealed as you show me how to live, through the example of the God-man
That's why,

[Hook: Chris Davis]
I wrote this song to tell you LORD
You're all I need (You're all I need)
(God) And I know you'll never fail me LORD You're all I need
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father
You're all I need (You're all I need)
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in around me
You're all I need (You're all I need, You're all I need)

[Outro: Tedashii]
You're all I need Father God I see you're all I need (All I need)
God, God you're all I need to tell the truth LORD
You're all I need (All I need)
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father
You're all I need (You're all I need)
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in around me
You're all I need (all I need)
