Like an 808
'08, '08

[Hook:]
You, you got my heart
You got my heart goin' down in flames
And it's beatin'
And it's beatin' like an 808
Like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Like an 808
Like, boom, boom-boom, boom, boom
Yeah, like an 808

Got me open
Girl, you got me open, got me open
Heart open
My uncle said that's when it's all over
Got me caught up tryna walk slower
Movin' fast seems to make it last
And I can't explain it but baby that's what I really want more of
You and me
Can't explain, that's what you do to me
Try to change it, but I can't
This the newer me
Girl I'm in, off the fence
I ain't listen to 'em, heaven sent
You from Him, that's enough for me
Down for you
Girl, I'm down for you
Danger come your way
Hear me say, no delay, that I'm down for you
I don't know what to say to prove to you that I'm here for you
And there's nothing you can do to make me stay away

[Hook:]
You, you got my heart
You got my heart goin' down in flames
And it's beatin'
And it's beatin' like an 808
Like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Like an 808
Like, boom, boom-boom, boom, boom
Yeah, like an 808

You and me, that's the right math
Together equals life, yeah
Joy, pain, sunshine, rain
And I can make to the end, long as you're right there

I been holdin' out for just you
And holdin' on since the day I met you
I had to step to you
You know you special
And there ain't no one else for me except you
Leave it all to me I'll do the sweeping
Off your feet of the kitchen floor when you need it
Hold you down like I promised
Playin' games, I don't want it
Momma told me talk is cheap, so I put a ring on it
And I ain't runnin' game, I'm runnin' to you
Switchin' up my aim, got my ? on you
Nothin' was the same, same day you came through
You the one to blame for the flame
Unashamed, can't contain all the things that I'm feelin'
All the things that I'm feelin'
Catchin' feelings while I'm ridin' like...

[Hook x2:]
You, you got my heart
You got my heart goin' down in flames
And it's beatin'
And it's beatin' like an 808
Like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Like an 808
Like, boom, boom-boom, boom, boom
Yeah, like an 808

Yeah, like an 808
'08, '08, yeah
Had my heart goin' down in flames
Give you everything
Yeah, you are my everything, everything, everything
You got my heart goin'...
