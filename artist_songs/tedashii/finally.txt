This momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)
[x2]

You can catch me with my hands up, hey this my stance now
Firm like a group of lawyers, this is worship hands down
I let them tears fall; cryin' out for hope
Christ in my line of sight like a scope (my aim)
'Cause the pain's risin', but I keep smilin'
This life just can't compare to paradise, it's like an island
No fear no shame in me
I wanna give up some times but it's plain to see

Lord you always have a plan for life; no backup
Close 'cause I stand with Christ
So I live with the end in mind, call it retirement
Heaven's will lived on Earth; what I'm desirin'

This momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)
[x2]
Home... Finally, I can see You, ohhhh
Finally, I can see You

I heard 'em sayin' hang on, people will tell ya stay strong
Encouragement is cool dependin' what it's based on
People grippin empty wishes, hopin' for something different
No faith, no escape, who can I run to?
When this world is a graveyard
Here today, gone today, with no hope for tomorrow

But it's different for the children of God
We hold to every promise even when it gets hard
Now can't compare to later, when we will see the Savior
Until we get to Heaven, I pray that He sustains us
Empty aim, unless it's in His name
Even when I pass away my remains, remain

This momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)
[x2]

Even if we held down, hang on to your happiness
Hopin' in His holiness and the fact He's compassionate
Eternal in perspective (huh) even in the rough times
Only for a moment (ahh) they could never shut us down
My pain is not pleasure, my grief is not joy
But both of them are in the fact that I'll see the LORD

And so will everyone, born to blood and water
Salvation's comin' so keep hopin' in the Father

This momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)
[x2]

Home... Finally, I can see You, ohhhh
Finally, I can see You, ohhh [x5]
