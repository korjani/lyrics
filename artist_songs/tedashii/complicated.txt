[Verse 1 - Tedashii:]
Uh, complicated
Man you don’t know the half of it
Talkin to myself I need help
Feelin empty like I never had nothing
Torture, man it feel like torture
It’s not like I was out chasin after money and tryna get the fame and the fortune nope
Just doin what we always (do) care without a clue
That’s when I got the phone call
Man now what I’m supposed to do
Maybe if I would’ve stayed home
Maybe if I wasn’t so busy
But maybe is a maybe
A vicious serpent that leave you feelin dizzy like

[Hook - Christon Gray:]
I don’t know
I think I forgot to stop it all and now I just be on the go
I should’ve been there when you needed me really I meant to be
This wasn’t even the plan but it all just went differently
It just went differently, yeah
Tell me when it got so complicated
I don’t know I don’t know
Never used to be this complicated
Maybe I should just take it slow

[Verse 2 - Tedashii:]
Slow, feel like everything movin slo-mo
But I recognize this, easy to spot like a logo
They say it’s the calm before the storm
But how do you prepare who do you warn
How do you recover once it come
And move on after the damage is done
I don’t know everything
Everything feel messed up
I feel confused all alone in my hole still dressed up
In a suit and tie
Askin who am I
It’s the truth they lie
When I do I cry
In my crew they like
Man I need to take time and slow it down
Cause you don’t know what you be doin out here
All of my pains be [?]
Yeah ain’t none of us safe like you in the clear
Foreign to this but they new to this here
This the only way that I know life
Remindin me of my old life
It’s all bad and we don’t know why
We need to take time to slow it down (down)
Man I’m not too different from the rest of y’all
How I trotted in my pain
You might be a part
I’m too busy out there livin I ain’t tryna stop
They say I should slow it down but they don’t know it all
Out hearin what they sayin man so do I blow it all
But if I choose to do that then will I blow it all
All I know is I that I’m really trying not to fall
Swear this life is complicated
My God
