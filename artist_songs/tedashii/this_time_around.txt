Things ain’t been perfect
No need to make ‘em worse
I know that you’re fed up
Gotta keep your head up
This time around
I don’t want no trouble
I can feel your struggle, yeah
We can make it better
You and me together
This time around

Oh my
Oh my
They don’t care how I live
They don’t care how I die
I can hope for the best
But it’s hard for me to see progress
When we slip and fall back like we slippin clocks back
Are we living in the past? I guess
No excuse for the troops or the youth
If you can’t bring change what’s the use?
I expect those in a vest, badge on their chest to respect those they put in check
Or at least please be professional at the most
Take it slow
All these funeral processionals
I’m tired of that, tired of that
Where I live
Where I live
They swear they don’t care to kill
But this time around we should turn it all around
Right now, right now

I know that we can do this better
This time around [3x]
I know
Do it better, yeah [2x]
This time around [3x]

I see a little bit of you in me
A little bit of me in you
Don’t let me go
Don’t let me go astray
I believe that we were meant to
Meant to be kings and queens
Do you, do you believe
I need to just breathe
If you could only see
That we were meant to
That we were meant to be kings and queens

I know that we can do this better
This time around [3x]
I know
Do it better, yeah [2x]
This time around [3x]

And I know it’s not you, it’s me
And I know it’s not you, it’s you
You can open your eyes, see what’s inside you
I just believe
Yes I believe
Oh I believe in you and me
This time around
