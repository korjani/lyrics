Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

So let's begin
Baby, I'm waiting
Come over here
I want to feel
I want to play
Here I go again 
Crazy boys

The lights are down
My eyes are dreaming
And all I see
Is only you
Inside the dark
Here we go again
Crazy boys

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Baby, baby, please forgive me 
I know not what I do (know not what I do)
Baby, baby, here I pray
Deliver me from you (from you)

For you I'd wait forever
Nobody does it better
Oo-oo-oo, Oo-oo-oo
Crazy boys
This new love I've discovered
From kisses like no other
Oo-oo-oo, Oo-oo-oo-oo
Crazy boys

What's wrong with me 
Wrapped around your finger
You grabbed a hold of me
And turned my world around
Upside again
Crazy boys

The way they look 
They got me falling 
There's nothing I could
Ever say or ever do
So caught up again
Crazy boys

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Baby, baby, please forgive me 
I know not what I do (know not what I do) 
Baby, baby, here I pray 
Deliver me from you (from you)

For you I'd wait forever
Nobody does it better
Oo-oo-oo, Oo-oo-oo
Crazy boys
This new love I've discovered
From kisses like no other
Oo-oo-oo, Oo-oo-oo-oo
Crazy boys

Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Forever and ever and ever (and ever)

For you I'd wait forever
Nobody does it better (Nobody, nobody, oh)
Oo-oo-oo, Oo-oo-oo (Nobody, nobody, oh)
Crazy boys
This new love I've discovered
From kisses like no other (like no other)
Oo-oo-oo, Yeah, Oo-oo-oo-oo
Crazy boys

Forever and ever and ever 
Crazy boys
