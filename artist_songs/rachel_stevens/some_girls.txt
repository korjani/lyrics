My baby drives a car (hey)
He calls me when he wants (hey)
I don a pair of zip-up boots
I go and shake my hair out loose
I never take my eyes off you
Oh no no, oh no no
No I don't think so

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

Footloose and fancy-free (hey)
My baby waits for me (hey)
He likes to put his own records on
He likes to tell me the things he's done
Such a strange way of having fun
Oh no no, oh no no
And away we go

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

Hey, stop
You made a promise to make me a star
(A hat, a lift)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A chat, a gift)
You made a promise to make me a star
(A drink, a kiss)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A hit, a miss)

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
