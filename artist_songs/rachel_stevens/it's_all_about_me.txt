She met him Saturday
He stole her heart away
Twenty-four Sunday
They didn't chat at all
Romantic Monday
Tuesday, a better day
But Wednesday to Saturday
Don't know why he didn't call

Oh, I wonder where you've gone
Oh, did I do something wrong

You said it's all about me 
You tell me what's the truth 
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier to be with you 
Is it all about me
Cause I'm trying to be cool
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier just to be with you

Phone rang on Sunday
He's talking differently
I guess she'll put it down
To experience
He said he's sorry
That he's been so busy
She said don't worry
Even though it made no sense

Oh, I wonder where you've gone
Oh, what did I do wrong

You said it's all about me
You tell me what's the truth
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier to be with you
Is it all about me 
Cause I'm trying to be cool 
I'm happy to be free 
But I'm happier just to be with you 

You're just somebody new 
That I don't know at all
But in the moment I got caught up
That's what people do
Now you've turned out the lights
Did I misread the signs
So what's happening
You gotta know what I'm goin' through

Oh, I wonder where you've gone 
Oh, What did I do wrong

You said it's all about me
You tell me what's the truth
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier to be with you
Is it all about me
'Cause I'm trying to be cool
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier just to be with you

You said it's all about
You said it's all about me
You tell me what's the truth 
I'm happy to be free 
But I'm happier just to be with you

You said it's all about
You said it's all about me
