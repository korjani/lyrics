Night got cold, it's almost three
Take these fools away from me

Funny how I always know before it's over
Deep down it's time to go
The night got cold, it's almost three
Take these fools away from me

What I want, what I need
Is an extra-ordinary love
I can taste, I can feel
Electricity from up above
What I want, what I need
Oh, a never-ending style
But it seems, it's in my dreams
Every time I look into his eyes

I'm getting high on emotion
One little kiss, I'm awake
I want to give you devotion
So don't walk away

Funny how I always know before it's over 
Deep down it's time to go 
The night got cold, it's almost three 
Take these fools away from me 
I want a love like lovers on the run 
I won't take just any one 
My heart got tired, it's way past three 
Take these fools away from me

What I want, what I need
Is an ordinary wonderland
When I'm down on my knees
Something beautiful to hold my hand

I'm getting high on emotion
One little kiss, I'm awake
I want to give you devotion
So don't walk away

Funny how I always know before it's over
Deep down it's time to go
The night got cold, it's almost three
Take these fools away from me
I want a love like lovers on the run
I won't take just any one
My heart got tired, it's way past three
Take these fools away from me

Night got cold, it's almost three
Take these fools away from me

Funny how I always know before it's over
Deep down it's time to go
The night got cold, it's almost three 
Take these fools away from me 
I want a love like lovers on the run 
I won't take just any one 
My heart got tired, it's way past three 
Take these fools away from me
