You're dreaming 'bout a girl
Who lives her life in plastic (plastic)
A secret kind of world
It sounds a lot fantastic, yeah

She lets you think that she's acting kind of stupid 
Looks good in pink and she knows just how to use it 
Her dance with diamonds brings a sparkle to the music 
Her laugh is sleeping under her skin

And all she wants is love
And all she wants is dumb-da-da-dumb
Searching for a touch
That's more than just a dumb-da-da-dumb
Hides behind her heart
And all we see is dumb-da-da-dumb
You could give her love, love, love
Love

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 

Behind the mascarade 
Between the smoke and mirrors 
Her tear drops will explode 
Into the night that glitters, yeah

You see she sacrificed her image for her beauty
But looking deeper you can see that she's unhappy
You can kiss her, you can wake her from her sadness
Her laugh is living under her skin

And all she wants is love
And all she wants is dumb-da-da-dumb
Searching for a touch
That's more than just a dumb-da-da-dumb
Hides behind her heart
And all we see is dumb-da-da-dumb
You could give her love, love, love
Love, love, love

[breathes] Huh, huh, huh, huh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Her laugh is living under her skin

And all she wants is love
And all she wants is dumb-da-da-dumb
Searching for a touch
That's more than just a dumb-da-da-dumb
Hides behind her heart
And all we see is dumb-da-da-dumb
You could give her love, love, love

And all she wants is love
And all she wants is dumb-da-da-dumb
Searching for a touch
That's more than just a dumb-da-da-dumb
Hides behind her heart
Dumb-da-da-dumb
You could give her love, love, love
You could give her love, love, love
You could give her love, love, love
