Don't be late
'Cause I can't wait
And you know
I've been looking forward to our time
Don't be shy
Boy, I'll erase
I'll make you over
You'll be new angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name

Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
I wait 
Come baby, right this way 
I will live what you say 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
Fire away

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Old sweet sins 
You must not fear 
Shame little know me
Don't believe all the things you hear 
Cause they won't know 
If I don't say 
So don't think it over
Let's go now angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name

Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
I wait 
Come baby, right this way 
I will live what you say 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
Fire away

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Some like it hot 
And some need to cry 
Sing nothing, baby 
Make up your own mind 
What you want 
If you are game 
I'll make you over 
You'll be new, Angelo
Oh, let me hear you say my name 

Come on in from the rain 
Come, I'll warm you again 
Oh loud, Angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name 

Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
I wait 
Come baby, right this way 
I will live what you say 
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away

Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again 
Je m'appelle Rachel 
I wait
Come baby, right this way 
I will live what you say
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away

Fire away
Je m'appelle Rachel
