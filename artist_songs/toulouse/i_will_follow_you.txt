I will follow you
Follow you wherever you may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my love

I love you
I love you
I love you

Where you go, I follow
I follow
I follow

You'll always be my true love
My true love
My true love
Forever

I will follow you
Every since you touched my hand, I knew
Near you, I always must be
Nothing can keep you from me
You are my destiny

I love you
I love you
I love you

I love you
I love you
I love you

Where you go, I follow
I follow
I follow

You'll always be my true love
My true love
My true love
Forever

I will follow you
Follow you wherever you may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my love
