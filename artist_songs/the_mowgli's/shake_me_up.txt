Sometimes I call
Just to see how you are
But I don't really care either way
It's just a feeling I'm grabbing
Just another bad habit
One more thing that you'd like to erase

She usually don't answer
'Cus she knows what I'm after
Curiosity's got her this way
It's just a feeling I'm grabbing
You don't know unless you've had it
One less thing that you'll have to explain

You're the heart in my ache
You're the love that I make
You're the heart in my ache
You're the eye of a hurricane

I want all of your love
Come on and dizzy me up
Shake me up
I want to feel something bigger than us
Astronomical love
The kind you find when you're young
All I want is your lo-uh-uh-uh-ove

Well sometimes it's easy
To forget you completely
Then there's those days you don't leave me at all
We exist in this moment
And you smile 'cus you know it
I just can't keep you too far from my thoughts

You're the heart in my ache
You're the love that I make
You're the heart in my ache
You're the eye of a hurricane

I want all of your love
Come on and dizzy me up
Shake me up
I want to feel something bigger than us
Astronomical love
The kind you find when you're young
And you're dumb
I want to feel something bigger than us

You're the heart in my ache
You're the love that I make

All I want is your love
Come on and dizzy me up
All I want is your lo-uh-uh-uh-ove
(Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I still believe everything
(oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
Everything, everything
(oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
But this little part of me
Wants to be everything you ever dreamed

I want all of your love
Come on and dizzy me up
Shake me up
I want to feel something bigger than us
Astronomical love
That you're magnetic as fuck
Shake me up
I want to feel something bigger

I want all of your love
Come on and dizzy me up
Shake me up
I want to feel something bigger than us
Astronomical love
The kind you find when you're young
And you're dumb
I want to feel something bigger than us

You're the heart in my ache
You're the love that I make

All I want is your love
Come on and dizzy me up
All I want is your lo-uh-uh-uh-ove
