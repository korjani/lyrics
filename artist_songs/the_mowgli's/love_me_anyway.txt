I've been drinking too much
Not been thinking enough
She's been coming around but I've been gone
I've been taking my time
Always walking that line
Between what I know is right and what is wrong

Just another day of growing up
I get stuck in my romance and
I can't win no matter what I say
But you love me anyway

Oh you know I love you
But no I am not a saint
Oh I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
Oh I forgot your birthday
And yeah I show up late
Oh I'll get it right someday
'Cause you love me anyway

I've been smoking too much
But I'm giving it up
I feel this air in my lungs so won't you stay?
'Cause I go crazy sometimes
Always think that I am right
You my love in my life forever babe

Just another day of growing up
I get stuck in my romance and
I can't win no matter what I say
But you love me anyway

Oh you know I love you
But no I am not a saint
Oh I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
Oh I forgot your birthday
And yeah I show up late
Oh I'll get it right someday
'Cause you love me anyway

Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah-oah
Yeah you love me anyway

I've been drinking too much
Not been thinking enough
But I'm coming around so won't you stay?

Oh you know I love you
But no I am not a saint
Oh I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
Oh I missed out your birthday
And yeah I sure can stay
Oh I'll get it right someday
'Cause you love me anyway

Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah-oah
Yeah you love me anyway

Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah
Oh-oah-oah-oah-oah
Yeah you love me anyway

Oh-oah-oah-oah

Oh-oah-oah-oah-oah
Yeah you love me anyway
