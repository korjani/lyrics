Loves on the page and then you turn me away.
Now I'm flying alone, sad wasted space.
Now everyone around seems to have figured it out, like, yesterday.
What about me am I asleep?

And if the window leaks than we can drink the water.
But if you suddenly feel weak in the knees do you bother?

If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands, 
because there's always time for living life.
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house.
It's better for you, better for me 
to get outside and see what's going on.

Well I was on a walk, I heard an old lady talk straight to a clock.
Her head must have been up in space.
And when I looked around I saw a man asleep on the ground.
He was wearing a frown upside down I saw his face.
And if the window leaks than we can drink the water.
But if you suddenly feel weak in the knees do you bother?

If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands, 
because there's always time for living life.
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house.
It's better for you, better for me 
to get outside and see what's going on.

What's going on.
What if the earth should start to fall?
What if the sky came down below?
Follow your only will.
Open your heart and to this life you wanted to love from the stars.
If you just think about it, don't even bother.
Well if you just think about it, well no there's no need to bother.

If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands, 
because there's always time for living life.
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house.
It's better for you, better for me 
to get outside and see what's going on.

What's going on.
