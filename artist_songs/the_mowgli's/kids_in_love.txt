You’re only alone cause everybody’s alone, 
skipping movies to the sad parts, it’s too hard, 
Forget about it, forget about it.
And then you start getting old, 
and everybody you know buries their past 
in the backyard like track marks,
Don’t ask about it, don’t even think about it.

But time moves slowly, always chasing 
something that you knew you left behind

Kids in love will do almost everything, 
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything,
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing,
Growing up now, growing up now quickly.

There’s days that your home is just some place that you go,
Trying to hide from dark spots on sidewalks,
It’s always on us, yeah it’s all around us.
You’re not alone, as far as honesty goes, 
I’m sick of looking sideways these days, 
I’m staring at it, yeah, I’m gonna fight it

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing
Some things you leave behind, and never find

Kids in love will do almost everything, 
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything,
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing,
Growing up now, growing up now.

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing,
Kids will fall in love over pretty much anything,
Growing up now, growing up quickly.

Kids in love will do almost everything, 
Kissing in the dark, kissing in the dark,
Kids in love will do almost everything, 
Kissing in the dark, when no one's looking

Kids in love will do almost anything, 
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything,
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing,
Growing up now, we growing up now,

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing,
Those kids will fall in love over pretty much anything,
Growing up now, growing up now, whoo!

It’s funny how those kids in love will do almost everything,
Growing up now, growing up now quickly.
