The night makes me say
Things when I don't feel that way
All of my days
Kaleidoscope into a million things

You keep me awake
Calling me up on your cigarette break
Got nothing to say
So I'm listening to every breath you take

I was on the back of your mind
I kinda like what I see but I don't wanna be here

So what if you know
How to dig through the trash and come out with gold
So what if you're broke
I'm sure someone probably cares
But I swear I don't
Monday still alone
Sun is coming up where'd your weekend go
So what if you know
So what so what so what... so what

Anything you say
A million times is gonna sound insane
Maybe it's a waste
Maybe everything is these days

I was on the back of your mind
I kinda like what I see but I don't wanna be here

So what if you know
How to dig through the trash and come out with gold
So what if you're broke
I'm sure someone probably cares
But I swear I don't
Monday still alone
Sun is coming up where'd your weekend go
So what if you know
So what so what so what... so what

I'm feelin' alright
Throw your hands together
If you're feelin' tonight
I'm feelin' alright
For the first time in a long time
So throw your hands together
If you're feelin' tonight

So what if you know
How to dig through the trash and come out with gold
So what if you're broke
I'm sure someone probably cares
But I swear I don't
Monday still alone
Sun is coming up where'd your weekend go
So what if you know
So what so what so what... so what

I was on the back of your mind
I kinda like what I see but I don't wanna be here

So what if you know
How to dig through the trash and come out with gold
So what if you're broke
I'm sure someone probably cares
But I swear I don't
Monday still alone
Sun is coming up where'd your weekend go
So what if you know
So what so what so what... so what
