You're homeward bound for wisdom cos you've seen the webs you spun
You're versed in vice and virtue but this time your vice has won
But when hopelessness would tell you that your better days are done
Have no fear you'll overcome
There are times when you might feel that there's nothing left to hold
That every time you lift your chin your faults have laid you low
But mercy's in the mightiest and mighty is the judge
He will lift you up above
And you'll cry...
Now I am a heart with a head on my shoulders and I say that I'm a different child
