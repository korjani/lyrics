Take it back
Oh, take it back

I don't want your lovin' anymore
Let me live, oh let me live
It's not you who I sing for

So don't sit next to me
Sit by yourself

I don't wanna wonder whether you love me
I don't wanna wonder whether you care

So don't try to woo me
Don't try to fool me

Oh, I know all of your tricks

It's the possibility of stayin' in my corner

I don't wanna wonder whether you love me
I don't wanna wonder whether you care

So don't try to woo me
Don't try to fool me

Oh, I know all of your tricks

It's the possibility of stayin' in my corner
