Talking on the phone and watching "Cribs"
He doesn't know what kind of guy he is
He's got a gold-plated ceiling and a TV show
A broken heart and he doesn't even know
He's glad to see you, yes, he's glad to see you
Open your arms and sing
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And they've just gotta hear it
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
So open your arms and sing for us

The world can be quiet when you're up too late
I'm just a childhood prisoner of the garden gate
If it's broke then kick it, dust yourself off
Find a quiet place and have a good laugh
I'm glad to see you
Yes, I'm glad to see you

Open your arms and sing
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And they've just gotta hear it
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
So open your arms and sing for us
