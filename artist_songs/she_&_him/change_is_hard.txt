I'm all out of luck
But what else 
Could I be?
I know he's yours
And he'll never belong
To me again

I did him wrong
So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know

So I'll keep my head down
If you keep it quiet from now on
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Than the bells of new love

So don't brag
Keep it to yourself
I did him wrong

I was never no
I was never no
I was never enough
But I can try
I can try
To toughen up
I listened
When they told me
If he burns you
Let him go
Change is hard
I should know
I should know
I should know
