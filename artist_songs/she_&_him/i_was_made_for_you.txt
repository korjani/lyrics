I was takin' a walk
When I saw you pass by

I thought I saw you lookin' my way
So I thought I'd give you a try

When I saw you smile
I saw a dream come true
So I asked you, maybe, baby whatcha gonna do?

'Cause I have been waitin' for a long long time
For a boy like you

I won't be waitin' anymore cause I know:

Baby! Baby!
I was made for you
