Remember last summer when we had the chance
To find each other, start makin' romance?
It didn't come off, 'cause you found another
Without one hand of the clock, what good is the other?

And I can't find no true love, oh, baby, it's so hard
And I still think about you every time I'm ridin' in my car (Ridin' in my car)

So I went to the place where everybody hangs out
To see what everybody was talkin' about
And over in the corner, all alone with you
Was the boy from last summer singin' songs to you

And he can't sing what I can sing, oh, it's so hard
And I still think about you every time I'm ridin' in my car (Ridin' in my car)

When I'm home alone, I can think of other things to do
But when I'm rollin' in forward motion, I think about only you

It's been a year and a day since I talked to you
I don't know how I made it, but I sure have been blue
Every time I think of what might have been
I jump in my car and start ridin' again

And I can't find no true love, oh, baby, it's so hard
And I still think about you every time I'm ridin' in my car (Ridin' in my car)

I can't find no true love, oh, baby, it's so hard
And I still think about you every time I'm ridin' in my car (Ridin' in my car)
