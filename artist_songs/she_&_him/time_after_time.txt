Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
Youll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

Yes so lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be loving you
