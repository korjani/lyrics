It's hard to be ignored
When I look at you, you look so bored
My baby, my darling, I've been takin' a beating

Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun

It's hard to take the blame
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
My baby, my darling, I've been thinkin' of leaving

Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun

Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all feel ashamed sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
