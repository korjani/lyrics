Ah... Oo...

This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied 
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me, we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music hold me tight now baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music (baby)

Ahh...

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby 
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
