I like to learn things slow
I like learning alot
I like to get it all again and in the end
You know you get what you got
I like to mean what I say
But it don't always come through
'Cause if i say it all again, again, again
It doesn't make it more true

And the world's like a science
And I'm like a secret
And I saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

It's all just news to me
Don't really care if it hurts
'Cause if I knock it I won't know it
Then I know that it will only get worse
He was different at first
But then he won't understand
Because he's never gonna know me
If he doesn't want to just shake my hand

And the world's like a science
And I'm like a secret
And I saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

And the world's like a science
And I'm like a secret
And I saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

And the world's like a science
And I'm like a secret
And I saw you lingering still
I saw you lingering still
