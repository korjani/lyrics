Saw your face
My hand you took
Just like in a storybook

And you got me
Yeah, you got me

I can't even argue
Couldn't, cause it's true

Now you got me
Yeah, you got me

Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
Cause I'd locked it

Yeah, I'd locked it

I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head

Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me

I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head

Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me

Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
Cause I'd locked it

Yeah, I'd locked it
