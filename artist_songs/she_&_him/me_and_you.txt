Well, I'm back in your good graces again
Remember when you told me that I was your only friend?
Well, you've made the best of this life
Where you never knew one day from the next
Dig your heels in, little girl, put 'em to the test

You've got to be kind to yourself
You've got to be kind to yourself

Well, I heard you had the blues again
It seems like all those little things add up in the end
Well, I know that you worry a lot about
Things you can't control
There are so many things we'd like to have
But we just cannot hold

You've got to be kind to yourself
You've got to be kind to yourself
