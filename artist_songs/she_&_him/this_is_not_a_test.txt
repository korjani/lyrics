For those of you who tried, but didn't make it,
Settle down- it's never what you think.
The summit doesn't differ from the deep, dark valley,
And the valley doesn't differ from the kitchen sink.

For those of you who thought you'd be forgotten,
The friends you've made will try their best, to make it so.
Think of all the beauty that you left behind you.
You can take it if you want it, and then let it go.

And this is not a test,
No, this is not a test.
Taking numbers never made sense, anyways.
No, this is not a test,
No, this is not a test.
'Cause you can have it, if you want it, anyways.

For those of us who try to keep remembering,
Try to do our better than our best.
Think of all the children in the drifts of snow.
Winners never quit, but winters never rest.
