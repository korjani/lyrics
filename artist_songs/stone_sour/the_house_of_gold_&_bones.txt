Oh, this is what it's coming to, another Waterloo
You want to put me underground ‘cause I’m overused
Giving up as you’re pulling me down - I will make you come unglued
You can cover me in subtleties, what an effigy
I can fake it ‘cause you’ll never be real to me
I’m innocent - I know I’m near the end
But if I can’t understand I will never win

The more I know my mind, the more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt, I’ll never obey but I’ll always decide

All my hopes survive - I’ve got to do it alone
I will burn alive in the House of Gold and Bones

Oh, you’re the epitome of all the shit in me
And I’m surrounded by the people I will never be
Either way I’ve got nothing to prove to a son of a bitch like you
Well, this is hell and I wanted it, but I’m an idiot
It’s a phase ‘cause I know I’m illegitimate
Kill it - I want to see it - I want to feel it
I won’t be here forever

The more I know my mind, the more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt, I’ll never obey and I’ll always decide

All my hopes survive - I’ve got to do it alone
I will burn alive in the House of Gold and Bones

The more I know my mind, the more I leave this world behind
Living in the shadow of doubt, I’m already gone, I’m already alive

All my hopes survive - I’ve got to do it alone
I will burn alive in the House of Gold and Bones
All my hopes survive - I’ve got to do it alone
I will burn alive in the House of Gold and Bones
In the House of Gold and Bones
In the House of Gold and Bones
