All those times before
When I was just another face
Among the others
Keeping secrets to save myself
I could blend into the background
And savor the unknown
I could practice preservation
And hide behind this shell

But my god's are released
On a world that is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I know I'm all or nothing

Giving my elation
A little something to relax
All the others indecisions
Will make me go mad
There's no time to hear the arguments
Or simply close my eyes
I believe this confrontation
Deserves my full attention

When my god's are released on a world
That is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I know I'm all or nothing
I'm all or nothing

I can see why nothing has happened
Promises strain
I'm writing this down as I run
Take all the examples
And what have I learned?
Nothing can heal you
And everything burns

My god's are released on a world
That is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I'm all or nothing
I'm all or nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
