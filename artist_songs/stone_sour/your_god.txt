What am I suppose to do now?

Reveal to me this ugly thing
I must've meddled by your head
It's getting out of hand again
Nobody sees it, but I can.

You thought of everything, I bet
But did you think that I might die?
I haven't really smiled, and I don't know how long you know
Something's going to give again, something's going to give again!

I try to fight, but did you listen?
Even though you're gone, I'm never finished
I can never be your God
And I don't even think I want the job, anymore.

Say something, anything to me.
I did believe, but I have doubts.
So many reasons to hold on
Conflicting interest, isn't it?

I guess I'm better off in the end
Cause you were always there to blame
I haven't felt so bad, and I don't know how long you know.
I can't get away again, I can't get away again.

I try to fight, but did you listen?
Even though you're gone, I'm never finished
I can never be your God
And I don't even think I want the job.
See
I try to fight, but did you listen?
Even though you're gone, I'm never finished
I can never be your God
And I don't even think I want the job, anymore.

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?

All I ever did was try, but the story ends
So I guess I'll have to die.

Where am I supposed to go now?

[some speaking]

Go ahead, and go away [x4]
Go away!

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?

All I ever did was try, but the story ends
So I guess I'll have to die

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?

What am I supposed to do now?!
(What am I supposed to do now?!)
How am I supposed to live now?!
(How am I supposed to live now?!)

How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to..?
