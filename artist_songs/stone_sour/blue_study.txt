Somewhere between my tongue and cheek
I can feel the hands on me
Pulls me in so we are face to face
I don't wanna see it...I don't wanna see
Hold my head up, can't avert my eyes
Spots and rats on me, I don't wanna see
Claw the ground up, get me out of this
Never wanted this - NEVER NEEDED THIS!

And you left me / and I left you
And you left me / and I left you, too

Chair is stained and I can't stay awake
Bring forth evidence to keep me sane
I can't keep this riddle locked inside
Seven ways to keep my secrets tied

Can't believe this, I belong in chains
Separated, it was me and something else
Now I'm numbing, get me out of this
Never wanted this - NEVER NEEDED THIS!

And you left me / and I left you
And you left me / oh, but then I left you and:
And you left me / and I left you
And you left me / and I left you, too

[Solo: Jim]

Arms stretched out, giving thanks to pain
Spotlight looking down, I'm ashamed
Kneeling with my forehead to the ground
I can't help but flinch before I'm found

I DON'T NEED YOU! Can't you see behind?
Doesn't matter now - DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE!
Maybe made me, get me out of this
Never wanted this - NEVER NEEDED THIS!

And you left me / and I left you
And you left me / and motherfucker, then I left you and...
And you left me / and I left you
And you left me / and I left you, too

SAFE! I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE!
SAFE! I JUST - WANT TO - BE SAFE!
SAFE! DON'T YOU WANT TO BE SAFE?
SAFE! WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME BE - SAFE?
