Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
Little off guard and unprepared

I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

I will give you anything to

Say you want to stay, you want me to
Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me
I want to know I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

Together, together we'll be together, together forever

Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little by little who you are

I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry in shadows I can't hide
I JUST WANT TO BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE

I will give you everything to

Say you want to stay you want me too
Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me
I want to know I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
[2x]

Together, together we'll be together, together forever
I BELONG TO YOU
[2x]

Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
Little off guard and unprepared

I will give you anything to
I will give you everything to

Say you want to stay you want me too
Say you'll never die you'll always haunt me
I want to know I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
[2x]

Together, together we'll be together, together forever
I BELONG TO YOU
[2x]
