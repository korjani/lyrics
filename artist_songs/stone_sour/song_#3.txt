If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe

No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take

Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place

Out of all the vast illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads

There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free

I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design

Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours 'cause you are mine

And if you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never going anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dying for you
I've never felt so alive

If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

I know you saved me too
