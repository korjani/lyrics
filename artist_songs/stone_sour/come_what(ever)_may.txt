Can you take away every single day?
That we have given to another false prophet
Can you give us all a reason not to fall?
Before you take away another broken promise

Show your pretty face
Hide the bitter taste
You're still the rapist of an entire nation
You wanna be the man you gotta be a man
But you were nothing but a sad insinuation
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?

Keep your fingers crossed
The truth is at a loss
Big decision for an ordinary coward
The only problem is your fucking rhetoric
We're more in danger than before you took power

Now it's just a game
God you'll never change
You'd sell us out if you could only find a buyer
You don't give a shit
As long as idiots
Are in your corner you could set us all on fire
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free
What the hell is free about it?!

Now we reached the end
Just get it over with
But this is building to an adament conclusion
Come what ever may
There's gonna be a day
When we have figured out a possible solution

Every thing you've done
Is killing everyone
A little smile on a homicidal bastard
You wanna be a man
You gotta have a plan
Another failure is a guaranteed disaster
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?
(Oh)
How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free
She only wanted the world
You never wanted to be
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free
But what the fuck is free about it?!
What the fuck is free about it?!
What the fuck is free about it?!
