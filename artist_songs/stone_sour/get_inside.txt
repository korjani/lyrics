Seed, gotta let it grow, why ya gotta watch when I let it feed?
Better look into the mirror for the face you hide away, everyday
But I don't give a fuck; I let it roll - I smoke the old 
Gotta run, gotta rend, gotta maim, gotta make it through another maze
STAY AWAY! 
Please: wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, GET INSIDE!

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)

Christ, have you seen this guy? Make ya sick, gonna peel away all the impurities
Cuz all you wanna do is keep curin' me, but I don't give a fuck I kill everyone 
You'll be mopping up blood and guts and all the shit when I'm done 
Isn't this fun? Gimme a gun and I'll tell you all the secrets I hide 
BEFORE I RUN! 

Please: wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me 
I don't even want you looking at me 
Motherfucker, GET INSIDE! 

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)

[Solo: Josh]

Maybe if you look away, I can slip away, gotta get away (RUN, MOTHERFUCKER)
Right now I stare at shit, I'm a heretic, but I'll never give you none of it 
Tied up in the back of the lab, laid on the slab, got the gift of gab, what'choo want from me?
I don't even know I got a damn disease, but I KNOW YOU WANNA KILL ME!

Please: wring the blood from my hands 
Don't pretend that you understand me 
I don't even want you looking at me 
Motherfucker, GET INSIDE! 

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
