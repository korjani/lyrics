The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot, I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you

No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon you can't have mine

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can feel if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh ho, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil but I won't be your hero

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My God has a need to react, it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle and face the facts

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can feel if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh ho, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil but I won't be your hero

One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth
Just to play to one more day

No fucking quota, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake, it's just inferred

Oh ho, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world

Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil but I won't be your hero
