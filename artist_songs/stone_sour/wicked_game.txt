The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
And I never dreamed that I knew somebody like you.

No, I don't want to fall in love.
No, I don't want to fall in love.
With you. With you.

What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt that way.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and,

No, I don't want to fall in love.
No, I don't want to fall in love.
With you. With you.

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you.
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you no,

No, I don't want to fall in love.
No, I don't want to fall in love.
No I…
No I…
Nobody loves no one.
