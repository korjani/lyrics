You deleted your evidence.
You depleted yourself.
Face down wasn't good enough.
You had to give me your hell.

Not much more inside of me left to lose.
No one hates me quite like you.
Let me show you the proof.

I don't mind my own self-loathing,
And I don't need help from you.
I know I'm lonely,
But what am I supposed to do?

You believe that you're innocent.
You're relieving your guilt.
The Jury seems to be deadlocked.
Look at the drama you built.

Seems like everyone's guaranteed damaged truth.
What makes someone hate like you?
And is there something to prove?

But I don't mind my own self-loathing,
And I don't need help from you.
I know I'm lonely,
But what am I supposed to do?

Oh, I don't mind my own self-loathing,
And I don't need help from you.
(I don't mind my own...)
I know I'm lonely, but what am I supposed to do
(I don't want to know...)
With all my coldest memories of you?
(I won't give my all...)
I know I'm angry... and I don't need help from you
(I don't want to know...)
