Oh save us all again from a cynic's Armageddon
When your mind didn't want to break, your rusty mouth consented
I think you're all afraid - too afraid to admit pollution
Now there's no easy way to avoid such a hard solution

Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?

Here we go again with a brilliant overreaction
My advice isn't gonna change - dysfunction over fashion
I think you're all ashamed - too ashamed to admit your faults
No daylight in the bunker - just darkness in the vaults

Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
There's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
Cuz there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

Goodbye - there's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
Cuz there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say... goodbye?
Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
