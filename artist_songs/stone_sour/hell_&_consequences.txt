I'm not a victim,
'Till I let you take me down.
I'm not a target at the sights of your mercy,
I never asked for anything,
I'm not asking now.
I will not be afraid,
I will not be afraid.

I've done this on my own
And I don't care what you do to me,
I won't hand over what is mine.
I've done this for too long,
To let you take it away from me,
It's too late to stop me
'Cause I refuse to die.

I haven't weakened just because I've shown myself.
I've taken everything, except what's for granted.
I'll leave hypocrisy for everybody else.
I will not be afraid, 
I will not be afraid.

I've done this on my own
And I don't care what you do to me,
I won't hand over what is mine.
I've done this for too long,
To let you take it away from me,
It's too late to stop me
'Cause I refuse to die.

I'm not a problem.
Until you make one out of spite.
I'll give you hell and consequences for trying,
If you don't want an enemy,
Don't fuck with my life!

I will not be afraid,
I will not be afraid.

I've done this on my own
And I don't care what you do to me,
I won't hand over what is mine.
I've done this for too long,
To let you take it away from me,
It's too late to stop me
'Cause I refuse to die.

I've done this on my own
And I don't care what you do to me,
I won't hand over,
I won't hand over what is mine.
I've done this for too long,
To let you take it away from me,
It's too late to stop me
'Cause I refuse.
I refuse... to die.
I refuse to die!
