Tell me again why you're running away - do you need me?
Nobody's home and there's nowhere to stay - do you believe me?
Maybe I can't be the man of your dreams - but I can save you
You were never really gone and it seems that you can feel it too
We won't see the stars if the sun is in our eyes... so don't look so surprised

Because it's just another reason why a fool like you
Would listen to a fool like me
I'll do what all the idiots around you do
And show you that you'll never be free
You're not supposed to feel this right
One is always better if you can't have two
Now that I have nothing while can't have you
You left me once - don't you leave me twice
Cuz no one is alone - no one is alone

Tell me again how I'm on your mind - you're always on mine
Tell me it's really just a matter of time - and I'll believe a lie
I can't see the sun because your stars are in my eyes... so don't look so surprised

Because it's just another reason why a fool like you
Would listen to a fool like me
I'll do what all the idiots around you do
And show you that you'll never be free
You're not supposed to feel this right
One is always better if you can't have two
Now that I have nothing while I can't have you
You left me once - don't you leave me twice
Cuz no one is alone - no one is alone

Oh what am I gonna do - you feel so right
Nothing is forever if it can't be true
Now that I am nothing I have to have you
You loved me once - you better love me twice
Cuz no one is alone - no one is alone

Tell me again why you're running away - do you need me?
Nobody's home and there's nowhere to stay...
