So I'm back in the corner
Looking at either side again
There's a terrible knowledge
That comes from being arrogant
Don't hold your breath, just keep what's left
You'll be justified
Reservations and revelations
Prepare to crucify!

I'm living incomplete!
I'm dying for release!
Killing extra time!
Born of different minds!
I will decide! (Decide!)

I'm seeing what the problem is
I'm anathema anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door
So I can never leave!

Oh the seminal coward
Threatens to show his hand again
I can see all the exits but
I'm missing what is evident
Don't save the best, just leave the rest
You'll be vilified
Lamentations and calculations
I've got nothing left to hide

So now I'm living incomplete!
I'm dying for release!
Killing extra time!
Born of different minds!
I will decide! (Decide!)

I'm seeing what the problem is
I'm anathema anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door
So I can never leave!

I'm seeing what the problem is
I'm anathema anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door
I can be a better artifact
Or I can be a bitter king
I should know what I'm made of
But I'm starting to believe
That I can never leave
