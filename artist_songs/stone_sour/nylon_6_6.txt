You stay locked in your head while you're raising the dead
All your neophytes hanging on everything you said
You can take it from me since you took it from me
Even now, the shadow I cast won't set you free

Do you feel your essence through the pain?
If you lose your conscience...

Take away the last of your woes that you're setting in stone
Well, your cover is passive-aggressive and blown
This is not about you, because it's all about you
You're out of luck... 'cause this is me not giving a fuck

Do you feel your essence through the pain?
If you lose your conscience...

Just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate
Because - we want more - we want more

Be/what you want/to be/get away/you're free
What you want/to be/get away/you're free
What you want/to be/get away/you're free

Just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate because
Oh, just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate
Because - we want more - we want more
Because - we want more - we want more
