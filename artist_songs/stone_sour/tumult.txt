GODDAMN YOU!!
Haven't let you in 'cause I'm in you
Haven't let you in 'cause I'm in you
Must have been a bitch, must have been a pain
Take me off the "innocent"
Put me in your vein!

IT'S IMPROBABLE
IT'S IMPROBABLE

Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on
Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on
Mustn't take offense, mustn't take a bow
Used to be a derelict
Now I have to live with it!

IT'S IMPROBABLE
IT'S IMPROBABLE
IT'S IMPROBABLE
YOU CAME BACK, BUT I KNOW BETTER, BOY

Trip my light fantastic
Rub me in your wound
I'm not broken, I'm not plastic
I'm no whore...
Used against me - use me up again

IT'S IMPROBABLE
IT'S IMPROBABLE
IT'S IMPROBABLE
YOU CAME BACK BUT I KNOW BETTER, BOY

(sometimes I think I'm crazy; other times I know I'm not)

Got no time to time to time (once again)

You don't want me, you don't need me!
