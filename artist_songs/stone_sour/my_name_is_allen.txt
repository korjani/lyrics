Hope I'm not hopeless
Gathering focus
I have no pity for a prison that died

Don't even say it
Consider the source again
Your indecision let me make up my mind

The normally vacant
Will make you contagious
What does it matter when the human is gone

Before you bother
I knew I'd mastered this
So take your time
'Cause I know what went wrong

There's only room in here for one
And I've decided it's not you
I had to do what must be done
You would have done it too

Suddenly I'm feeling strange
I know you want it
Tell me you will never change
I know you wanted to

Nobody's out there
You're getting us nowhere
I just remember why I put you through hell

You might be different
But I didn't ask for this
You know you're crazy when you're talking to yourself

There's only room in here for one
And I've decided it's not you
I had to do what must be done
You would have done it too

Suddenly I'm feeling strange
I know you want it
Tell me you will never change
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to

Why delay or complicate
The gravity of my persuasion
Look into that part of you
I am you without hesitation

There's only room in here for one
And I've decided it's not you
I had to do what must be done
You would have done it too

Suddenly I'm feeling strange
I know you want it
Tell me you will never change
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to
I know you wanted to
