That is all I want to say
Our love could save the day
That is all I'm waiting for
To try to love you more -

- and that is all I want to do
To get right next to you
That is all I'm living for,
Your love and nothing more
And that is all

Times I find it hard to say
With useless words getting in my way
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been
said before.

That is all I want from you
A smile when I feel blue

That is all I'm waiting for
Your love and nothing more

And that is all

Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been
said before.
But that is all I want to do
To give my love to you
That is all I'm living for,
Please let me love you more - and
that is all
