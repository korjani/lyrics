I found the cure and no one cares
It's just another thing to sell
I found a church, and no one's there
It's just another thing that failed

(I'll bring you down)
I got inside my pickup truck to take a ride
(I'll bring you down)
Forgot what I was looking for and they arrived
(I'll bring you down)
I'm lucky I am not a slave that's going down
(I'll bring you down)

Down from the sky
(falling)
Down from the sky
(falling)
Down from the sky
(falling)
Falling from the sky

Got some love, yes I dared
I didn't find it anywhere
Found some sex, another world
Sometimes it seems like you don't care

(I'll bring you down)
I got inside my pickup truck to take a ride
(I'll bring you down)
The psychics gathered all around and said I lied
(I'll bring you down)
And I'm lucky I am not a slave that's going down
(I'll bring you down)

Down from the sky
(falling)
Down from the sky
(falling)
Down from the sky
(falling)
Falling from the sky
