I am looking for inspiration
And I think I found it in your heart
It's the kind of thing you get when you're not looking
It's the kind of thing you had from the start

Put me on a ship that is sinking
On a voyage to an untamed land
Take away the freedoms I wanted
I understand

Please, don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
Please, don't take your love away from me

Please, don't take your love from me
Please, don't take your love from me

Put me inside flesh that is dying
A ghost that wanders without rest
Buried by desires and weakness
I understand

Please, don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me

Please, don't take your love from me
Please, don't take your love from me
