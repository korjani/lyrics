I know you just want to kill me
End the pain inside
I still reached out my hand to you like an innocent child

You took me for a ride
You took me for all the other fools in your life
Now I don't care about your pain anymore

I need to say goodbye
You're worth nothing to me
It's easy to forget what you've done to me

You took me for a ride
You took me for all the other fools in your life
Now I don't care about your pain anymore

The world is filled with sunshine love and roses
You bleed enough and then the bleeding stops

What you've done to me
(What you've done to me)

I need to say goodbye
You took me for all the other fools in your life
Now I don't care about your pain anymore

Now I don't care about your pain anymore
(You took me for all the other fools in your life)
I don't care about your pain anymore
