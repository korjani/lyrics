Every time that I cry out
No one ever comes to me
Ever y time that I reach out
No one ever rescues me

I wish I could hide from everyone

Is there somewhere else to be
Is there somewhere else to be
Take me in
I want out
That's all I need

I wish I could run from everything

Is there somewhere else to be
Is there somewhere else to be
Take me in
I want out
That's all I need
