There's a sun, there's a ground under my feet
There is almost nothing in between
Now I'm left like a flag atop a moon
Precious one, you have abandoned me

Ooh so let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no one said I was

Should I call you
Should I reach out
It feels like chasing shadows in the night
Yeah let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no one said I was, no one said I was

Thrown away, have I been thrown away
Thrown away, have I been thrown away

There's a sun, there's a ground under my feet
There is almost nothing in between
Now I'm left like a flag atop a moon
Precious one, you have abandoned me

Ooh so let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no said I was, no one said I was

Thrown away, have I been thrown away
Thrown away, have I been thrown away
