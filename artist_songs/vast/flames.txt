Close your eyes
Let me touch you now
Let me give you something
That is real

Close the door
Leave your fears behind
Let me give you
What you're giving me

You are the only thing
That makes me want to live at all
When I am with you
There's no reason to pretend that
When I am with you
I feel flames again

Just put me inside you
I would never ever leave
Just put me inside you
I would never ever leave

You
