When you saw the evening star
Shining in the freezing sky
I saw something dark and silent
Passing by

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water

When you said your name out loud
Something broke inside me
Nothing new to take a hold of
No new world to hide me

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water
