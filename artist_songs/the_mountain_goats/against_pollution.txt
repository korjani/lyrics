When I worked down at the liquor store
Guy with a shotgun came raging through the place
Muscled his way behind the counter
I shot him in the face

This morning I went down to the Catholic Church
'Cause something just came over me
Forty-five minutes in the pews
Praying the rosary

When the last days come we shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets, brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves, for the first time, the way we really are

Decorative grating on my window
Gets a little rustier every year
I don't know how the metal gets rusty
When it never rains here

A year or so ago I worked at a liquor store
And a guy came in
Tried to kill me, so I shot him in the face
I would do it again, I would do it again

When the last days come we shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets, brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves, for the first time, the way we really are
