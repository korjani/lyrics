You bought me some candy.
And you bought me some flowers.
And you bought me a sofa.
And you bought me a radio.

Thank you for the candy.
Thank you for the flowers.
Thank you for the sofa.
Thank you for the radio.

(now I have everything I need.) [x4]

You brought me a puppy.
And you brought me a lamp.
And you brought me some books.
And you brought me a filing cabinet.

Thanks you for the puppy.
Thank you for the lamp.
Thanks for the books.
Thanks for the filing cabinet
I don't know what I did without it.

(now I have everything I need.) [x4]

You came by. and you came in.
And you let the wind in.
It must be cold outside.
We looked out, through the sliding glass door.
But I'd forgotten what we were looking for.

Thank you for coming by.
It's nice to see you once in a while.
Thank you for the coat I forgot to mention.
I've been freezing in here.
I've been freezing in here.

(now I have everything I need.) [x4]
Yeah!
