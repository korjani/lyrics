I hear you moving in the hallway.
I hear you sharpening your claws.
I hear you polishing your teeth, sometimes.
but I don't mind.

and I hear you out in the garage.
I hear you messing with the motor.
I hear you tinker with the engine, sometimes.
but I don't mind.

and I hear you moving in the kitchen!
I hear you in there late at night.
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes.
but I don't mind.
