All I know is I'm in love with you
Even though you say that we are through
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Always thought you'd love me more and more
Never dreamed you'd ever let me go
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Now what did I do and what did I say
That ever could lead you to treat me this way?
If I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay
And darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say

So darling, please, wherever you may be
Hear my plea and hurry home to me
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
