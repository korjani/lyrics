Window facing an ill-kept front yard
Plums on the tree heavy with nectar
Prayers to summon the destroying angel
Moon stuttering in the sky like a film stuck in a projector

And you
You

Twin prop airplanes passing loudly overhead
Road to the airport, two lanes clear
Half the whole town gone for the summer
Terrible silence coming down here

And you
You

There is no deadline
There is no schedule
There is no plan
We can fall back on

The road this far can't be retraced
There is no punchline anybody can tack on
There are loose ends by the score
What did I come down here for?

You
You
