Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers
Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris.
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
Don't even question your senses.
You can be sure that's me.
When all the pretenders to your hand lie dead across the land,
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
Crawling around, down on the ground.

When the hail mary's you've been saying lose their savor,
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in,
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
It was their love you wanted, not mine.
But when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
Crawling around, down on the ground.

And I will throw you across my shoulders.
And I will bleed and I will drool.
And the cameras will slow pan across my face.
And I will try to say something cool.

Just as the hoardes of thirsting demons close around us,
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun,
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
You know and I know.
Everyone knows it.
I'm the one.
I may have failed you once before,
But this right here, this means war.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
Crawling around, down on the ground.
