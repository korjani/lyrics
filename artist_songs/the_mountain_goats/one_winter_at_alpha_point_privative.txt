What the hell kind of deal is it here anyway?
how much does it cost and how long can you stay?
should we dance? should we sing? should we curse? should we pray?
do I have to hang on every single word that you say?
every hour, every minute, every second of the day
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

what the hell's going on at the end of the debate?
there's nothing you can do but?
could we sit down over there? could we sit down any place?
can you feel the spirit moving? can you feel god's grace?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

ever since I've married you I've wondered what it means.
that every single shirt I owned was?
every single piece of clothing, every last pair of jeans,
all the reds, all the whites, all the yellows, all the greens.
I'm sure that there's a reason all of this is happening.
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
