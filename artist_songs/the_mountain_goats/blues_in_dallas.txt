Will I see you there when that final trumpet blows?
Will I see you there when that final trumpet blows?
If I don't see you there, I will run a comb through my hair
And I will wait, I will wait, I will wait

Will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
Will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
If I don't see you go, I will let the minions flow
And I will wait, I will wait, I will wait

Down in Dealey Plaza, the tourists mill about
Down in Dealey Plaza, the tourists mill about
And I am far from where we live, and I have not learned how to forgive
But I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
