well I see you've left me a photograph 
of a leopard tearing an antelope in half. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have you done with our love? 
what have you done? 

well I see you've resorted to petty theft. 
you try to take something from me, 
but there's nothing left. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have done with our love? 
where have you put it? 

well I hear you calling from way over there 
and I can't find it anywhere. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have you done with our love? 
what have you done?
