I am ready for my close-up today
Too long I've let my self-respect stand in my way
Well, the prom queen's caught in the high beams
And the strings keen, it's a big scene

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner

I spent eight hours in my makeup chair
Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair
Well, the fire's bright and the frame's tight
Try to get right while we've still got light

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner

When the house goes up in flames
When the scum begins to circle the drain
