Follow the grass up the mountain up the foot of the mountain.
Follow the twisting branches.
When you look at them
Remember that they are alive, growing still.
See their colors lighten, as you climb.
Watch the sunlight catch them and reflect them.
It reflects them everywhere.

One of these paths leading up the nameless mountain
Was the one that told you something once.
But you will not find it here.
It has shriveled up and pickeled off the mountain.
Like a dying vine.
One these things take on their weightlessness,
The structure comes apart.

How do the trees grow in this weather?
It is freezing cold.
Take the map on up the mountain side.
And all the sounds from far and wide will leave you suddenly.
And sugar winds come through the clouds.
