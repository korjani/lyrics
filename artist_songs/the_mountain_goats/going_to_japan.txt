There's a north wind coming in
and there's a west wind coming in
and there's an east wind coming in
and there's a strong wind blowing in from the south
and there's a sweet metallic taste in my mouth.
there's a dead feeling lingering over the wind.

and there's a one-way ticket in my hot little hand
and I'm kissing your eyelids and I'm going to japan.

there's life and liberty on my tongue
and there's a dead silence where the wind-chimes hung
and on some mountain somewhere in the world it's snowing
but here in the fields there's not a thing growing.
maybe next year, ya know, there is a way of knowing.
there's wind coming in from all directions.
there's a coat on my shoulders--midnight connections.

and I'm kissing you and leaving you behind in the sand.
I'm holding you a while then I'm going to japan.
