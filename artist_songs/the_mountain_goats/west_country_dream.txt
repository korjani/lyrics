Sure as a surgeon
You slipped your hand into the door jam
Blood coursing through the air tonight
I know who I am

And I know who you are
Or who you were just an hour ago
Static interference on the radio tonight
I know what I know

Quick as lightning
You brought your hand back inside
And you shut the door behind you
It's too hot out there tonight

Breath rising and falling
Expansion, contraction
Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
