On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
Not being used to being the only person there

The first time I made coffee for just myself I made too much of it
But I drank it all just 'cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
And I wandered through the house like a little boy, lost at the mall
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space

And I sang oh, what do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room out into the street

And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to pant
And the world, in its cold way, started coming alive
And I stood there like a business man waiting for the train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang oh, what do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?
