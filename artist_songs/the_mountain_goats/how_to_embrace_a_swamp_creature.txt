Got out of bed, could not remember my own name
Condemned to walk the soil amongst all creatures wild and tame
Go where I go, do what I must
Crawl, starving, on my belly, licking up the dry dust

I see the light in your window
Ride the elevator to the sixth floor
Stand with my arms at my sides
As you open up the door

But I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe

Alone with your bathroom mirror, try to get my head straight
Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear, clean slate
Meet up with you in the kitchen where the air is hot and dry
Open up all the faucets, be fruitful and multiply

I stand where
The flashing swords gleam
And I try to shake my head
Clear of the dream

But I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe

I start to sweat, I can't cool down
I'm scared of all the strangers in this town
I try to tell you just why I've come
It's like I've got molasses on my tongue

I made it through town somehow
But who's gonna save me now?

I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
