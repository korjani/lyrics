You looked real calm as we made our way up the walk
there were lazy kisses, hands brushing and small talk
the moon was high, your smooth face was dry, and the kudzu grew

and the stars fell on alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on alabama

the warm earth underneath us gave way
dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
cold clean water nearby, glimmered in your eyes 
and your pistol glistened.

and the stars fell on alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on alabama

but if you think I'll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.
