I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom.
I see the flags are flying high.
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room.
I guess you're trying to cut-off my air supply.

I came toward your window, real slowly.
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil.
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me.
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil.

my bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt,
moving up my ankles, but I don't fear you.
the thorns began tearing at my shirt,
but I didn't even care when they tore clear through.

your garden can't hurt me.
your flowers don't threaten my life.
your garden can't hurt me anymore.
your flowers don't threaten my life.
