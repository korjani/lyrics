the girl who'd been haunting your dreams all your life
the butcher from brooklyn, the butcher's wife
the girl who kissed you in the seventh grade
her and all the others lined up behind the gate
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
when the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you

and you had your camera
and you had your felt tip
and you had some money 
and you had everything you needed
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
we saw you coming up the boulevard
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
when the sun was bleeding all over you
