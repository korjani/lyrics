Doll squad's at the drive-in
it's 1973
the fruit is full and fat this year on the orange trees
which grow in clusters
the city sixty miles away
as the sunset tries desperately to break through the gray
and the stardust came down, royal blue
as the san bernadino sky showered over you

coming home early is always a mistake
but when you see that woman on the sofa something in you breaks
you've got a celluloid tendency to flare out and blaze
and the report sounds once like a failed hymn of praise
and the stardust came down, royal blue
as the san bernadino sky showered over you
