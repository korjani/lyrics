On Venus it rains sulphuric acid
And the raindrops evaporate before they hit the ground
Japanese red-crowned cranes by the water here
Trouble in town

I feel like I'm gonna drown down here
It's all coming down down here

Hurricanes in from Australia
Tore up the neighborhood
A telegram from Lithuania
And the news is not good

And I don't speak the language down here
It's all coming down down here

Johnson Johnson is my name
Brooklyn is my station
Heaven is my resting place
God is my salvation
