The king of the jungle
Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You've got to recognize them for what they really are

Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long, sharp tooth

And hold on
For dear life, I hold on

Well, of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am going to regret
The day that I was born

And then Mom rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone's screaming
I am dreaming of you

I hold on
For dear life, I hold on

And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
'Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet

In come the cops
They blowtorch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars

There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me

And we hold on
For dear life, we hold on
We hold on
