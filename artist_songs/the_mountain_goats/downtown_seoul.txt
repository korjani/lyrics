There was a new song on the air
I saw you coming across the square
And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky
As the rest of my life went by

Had your warm hand on my face
I took your index finger in between my teeth and I held it gently in place
It was resting lightly on my tongue in there
I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air

There but for the grace of the lord of song
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along
You had your cardigan on
I looked toward the sky, the white bird was gone

I remember your eyelids
I remember your body now
