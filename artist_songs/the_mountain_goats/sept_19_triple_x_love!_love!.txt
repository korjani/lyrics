I cut down that withered peach tree
Just like you asked me to
And I hacked it into pieces
Set it on fire with your face in plain view

At the near window where you stood
Watching me split the wood
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold

The fire pit in the snow
Gave off a rich, bright, orange-red glow
A familiar scent rose up into the air
And I remembered something special from a long time ago

You opened up the door
Stepped away from the killing floor
Your footprint on the snow is fresh and new
When you touched me I felt fire coming through

I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
