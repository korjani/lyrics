you say you came to see me,
because you had nothing else to do,
but I've got a radio.
you say you'd thought you'd stop on by
and let me have a look at you,
but I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.

you say you brought some photographs,
but I don't care to see them,
'cause I've got a radio.

you say this place must get dull sometimes,
but that's not the way I see it.
'cause I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got me a radio.
I've got a radio.

you see these frogs are treacherous,
but how long has it been since you've seen my feet?
you see, I've got a radio.
you warned me about all sorts of things,
but that's not the sort of warning that I need.
you see, I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
