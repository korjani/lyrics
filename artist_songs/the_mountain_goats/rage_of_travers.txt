Close the balcony and the rainbow
Because the promoter says so
Aviators and a buckskin frontier hat
How come they dress like that?
They break the news to me so gentle
But I start to feel sentimental
This used to be the place to go
Still draw pretty good in Ontario

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes

Let's just have a good time when the show's done
Ask where the good clubs are and go find one
Roll up to the curb
Spill out of the car
Everyone's dressed up like corpses
I brought my guitar
Set it down by the stage
The singer's locked up in a steel cage
Shaking the bars
Eyes wild with fear
I don't belong here

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes
