Cops and robbers; Strictly bargain line.
Spent the wet night tracking visions through the pines.
Draw my arms into my hospital gown.
See the sky open up and rain down,
Rain down.

Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
Mercy for the Diaz brothers.

Hear my rivals on the western wind.
Hard to know who might or might not be your friend.
Work by the Plutonian light.
Forbidden rosary prayers all night,
All night.

Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
Mercy for the Diaz brothers.

Beam of a flashlight,
All night in the woods.
Hunt us like dogs,
And then string us up for good.

Keep one step ahead of enemies.
Foretell worse things than such frightful nights as these.
Lead us to the beach by our hands,
And bury us there in the sand.

Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
Mercy for the Diaz brothers.
