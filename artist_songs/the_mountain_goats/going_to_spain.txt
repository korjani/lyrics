It's heaven up here,
but it's heaven down there!
and you're gonna leave me.
now I don't care.

it's heaven outside,
but it's heaven indoors.
well, go on and leave me.
I don't care any more.

I hear the airplane coming!
I hear the airplane coming!
I hear the airplane coming, now,
it can't touch me.

I see you going up the little stair.
go on and board the plane,
I don't care. I,

I see you hold his hand.
I see you wave good-bye.
I don't know you anymore,
so I'm not going to cry, now,

I see the airplane coming!
I feel the airplane coming!
I hear the airplane coming, now,
it can't touch me.
