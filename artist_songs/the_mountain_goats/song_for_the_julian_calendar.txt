Sun twinkling on the river this evening
I tasted chocolate on my tongue
Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky
Rung by agonizing rung

I heard firecrackers popping next door
Wondered what it was I'd bargained for
When I laid quiet on the floor
And you were knocking

Let me be your witness
Let me walk out on the edge
The sun refused to shine on my backyard today
Darkness climbing up the house, coming through the window ledge

I saw the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk
Heard you talking your baby talk
Saw the bright lights again and I
Felt the shock when you were knocking
