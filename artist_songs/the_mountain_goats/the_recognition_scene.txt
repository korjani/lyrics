We broke the doorknob off the door
The door swung open easily
We sauntered into the poorly-lit store
And looked around lazily

We stole every bit of candy they had inside
Gobbled it all up greedily on our three month ride
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

You headed out to the getaway car
And hit the open road
I saw something written in tall, clear letters on your face
But I could not break the code

We had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
And the only love I've ever known burning underneath
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
