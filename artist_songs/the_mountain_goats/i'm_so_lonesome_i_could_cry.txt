Hear that lonesome whipporwill
he sounds too blue to fly.
the midnight train is riding low.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

[sniff]

I've never seen a night so long,
when time goes crawling by.
the moon just went behind the clouds
to hide its face and die.

[sniff]

[sniff]

did you ever see a robbin weep
when leaves begin to die?
that means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

the sign has come, a falling star.
like love, a purple sky.
they'll never wonder where you are.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

[sniff]

I'm so lonesome I could cry.
