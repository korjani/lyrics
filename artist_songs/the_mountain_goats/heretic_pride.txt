Well, they come and pull me from my house
And they drag my body through the streets
And the sun's so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up
In the summer air so moist and sweet

And the people all come out to cheer
Rocks in the pathway break my skin
And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today
With every breath I'm drawing in

I want to cry out
But I don't scream and I don't shout
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

The crowds grow denser by the second
As we near the center of the town
And they dig a trench right in the main square right there
And they pick me up and throw me down

And I start laughing like a child
And I mark their faces one by one
Transfiguration's going to come for me at last
And I will burn hotter than the sun

I waited so long
And now I taste jasmine on my tongue
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives
