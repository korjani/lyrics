The wax paper that I taped over the windows
Melted quick as chocolate in the heat
It'll probably never come off now
The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street

And the dim light that filters through
Casts a new light on you
It makes me get all misty because I remember something
And then I see a shadow

And I wanna follow you all the way down this time
I want to see what it is you're going down for
I want you more than I want anything
I want you the way you were

You were lying in the moonlight
Outside in the grass
When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark
And I saw a wing shadow pass

And just then the gleam in your eye
Made my blood freeze
There was something up above us
Rustling in the branches of the trees

And I pressed up against you again
I could hear your heartbeat, steady and hard and pure
I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me
And I want you the way you were
