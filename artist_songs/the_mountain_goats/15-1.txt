If I had a car and you were riding in it
I'd show you what my car could do
I head east down highway fifteen and see the starlight
shower over you
gas fumes rising from the blacktop
cheap hotels with flashing signs
just an old sweet song made new
and oozing through the pines

if I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop
and the moon was high up above
and moon beams fell like sweet cream
and the night air would carry our dark dreams

gas fumes off the highway
neon flashing everywhere
just an old sweet song made new by your body
and desert flowers blooming in the thick night air
