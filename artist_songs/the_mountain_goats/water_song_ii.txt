They'll be singing out loud
when the water goes through the crowd.
they'll be howling for you
when the waves come crashing through.

I brought my friend. here he comes,
splashing, gurgling for you.
now the water runs through the streets unimpaired,
crashing through.

they'll be saying your name,
every voice different, every word the same.
they'll be holding you up
too close to the sun,
but I will make them stop.

I brought my friend. here he comes,
splashing, gurgling for you.
and now the water runs through the streets unimpaired,
rushing through.

still [?] singing, go stand in the light.
when my friend gets here he will set things right.
they'll be singing for one thing and they'll get this instead.
let them come and get me, let them strike me dead.

I brought my friend. here he comes,
splashing, gurgling for you.
now the water runs through the streets unimpaired,
rushing through.

I brought my friend. here he comes,
splashing, gurgling for you.
and now the water runs through the streets unimpaired,
rushing through.
