...he'll still be like
...it's so good. she's
...tell ya about personal testimony
...please keep feeding us

the young sun
the old story forming
hasn't been the same
since dad came by this morning
did you see the way mom's looking at us
mark it well

your eyes meet mine
when we hear her call
the strange birds in the yard
a portrait of the symbols that she painted on the garden wall
did you see the way mom's looking at us
did you see the way mom's looking at us
don't say anything
