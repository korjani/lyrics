Now if you stay out and start playing around
Your baby's going to burn your playhouse down
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You'll be a-moaning and a-groaning
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now wrong is wrong and right is right
If you make a pig mad he's sure going to bite
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
I've had it proven to me
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Every fuss got the same old end
I don't believe the good Lord meant for a man to win
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You'll be a-groaning and a-hopping
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now if she gets mad, and tells you goodbye
There's not a thing that you can do but sit at home and cry
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You better call her sweet mamma!
Lord, you better keep it on your mind
