'36 Hudson in the garage
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
Dishes in the kitchen sink
New straw for the old broom

Friends who don't have a clue
Well-meaning teachers
But down in your arms, in your arms
I am a wild creature

Floor two-foot high with newspapers
White carpet thick with pet hair
Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares

I write down good reasons to freeze to death
In my spiral ring notebook
But in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook
