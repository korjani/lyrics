your bright eyes render all discussion pointless
your bright eyes are gonna kill me for sure
i look at you and i know that the house will come down
because your burning eyes are bright and pure
but there's a room for us in a red brick building
by a bright green field in denmark

i've got a twitch in my leg and it makes me nervous
and i've got fifty cents in my watch pocket
and your name beating march time in my blood
putting pressure on the hollows of my eye sockets
there's a room for us in a red brick building
by a bright green field in a very old country

my mouth is open
so you can stuff the bright red roses in.
'cause i feel the california sky closing in.
there's a room for us on the third floor of a red brick building
by a green field with a stream running through it in denmark.
yeah!
