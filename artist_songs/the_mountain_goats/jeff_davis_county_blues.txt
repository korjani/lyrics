After three nights in jail
I head north from Toyahvale
Switch to 285 in Pecos
Head up to Red Bluff

My walk's real steady and my eyes are real
But I feel like I'm all of 16 years old
Lost in the Travelodge with the television on with the sound down
I don't feel so tough

Old issues of Sunset magazine to read
Sleep for twelve hours and dream about home

I have no place to go
So I drive up to New Mexico
Fix my eyes in the rear view
When I cross the state line

And I panic, I guess, and although it's quite late
I take the first exit to 128
I am coming back to Midland
And I hope you won't mind

Polaroids of the two of us
Scattered on the passenger seat
I drove slowly and evenly
And I dream about home
