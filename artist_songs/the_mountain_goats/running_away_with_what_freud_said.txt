Big city, wide corner,
New flowers, cold comfort.
56 Fahrenheit early in the morning.
Buses passing by black smoke in their wake.
Big surprises, a lot of big surprises
Bones ringing, running away with what Freud said.

New morning, world breathing,
Far, far from home
Big ringing in the bones
Whose bones are these? God please.
Feeling the pumping, feeling the fresh blood pump inside
City's living, the city's truly living
What's the difference?
Running away with what Freud said.
