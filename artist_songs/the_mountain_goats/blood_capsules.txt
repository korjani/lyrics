When the last of the East Coast money ran dry
And the casually-dressed bill collectors
Started casually dropping on by
And the residuals, but there weren't any more residuals
At least several months behind
On the payments to certain individuals

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules

I'm off the juice for seven months
I learn to like living clean
But there just isn't any money
On the independent scene
Not even if you're cutting corners
Staying in nights, eating alone
Somebody's gotta pay the gas bill 
It's not gonna go away on its own

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules

I'm the biggest guy in the bank line
Everybody else looks tiny
I could almost smell the fear
On the lunch-hour car salesman behind me
I know this isn't gonna work
I guess I'll see it when I see it
I can't work any other jobs
This was my last and best idea

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
