they wanted me to be a lawyer. 
they wanted me to work in a machine shop. 
they wanted me to be a designer, 
but I came out on top. 
I'm a fire-man. 
I'm a fire-man. 

stand and watch the smoke. 
see the flames rise to the sky. 
I stand and watch the flames climb higher. 
I feel the smoke get in my eyes. 
I'm a fire-man. 
I'm a fire-man.
