The most remarkable thing about coming home to you
Is the feeling of being in motion again,

It's the most extraordinary thing in the world.
I have two big hands
And a heart pumping blood
And a 1967 Colt .45
With a busted safety catch.

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia.

The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you
And that you are standing in the doorway

And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand
I am frozen with joy right where I stand.
The world throws its light underneath your hair.
40 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere.

Going to Georgia

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia
