(I know you're trying)

Everything and nothing always haunts me
I know you're trying, I know you're trying
Waiting for your moment to fall on me
I saw you trying, I saw you trying

Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother
Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me
Everything is true to me, never words where you would see
Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother

(I know you're trying)
(I know you're trying)

Hurts so bad, I don't know what you want from me
You know I'm trying, You know I'm trying
And now we're hanging on by a heartbeat
You know I'm trying, I was always trying

Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you try then I would not bother
Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me
Everything is true to me, never words where you would see
Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you try then I would not bother
I've been hating everything, everything that could have been
Could have been my anything, now everything's embarrassing

Acting like it's nothing; such a bore
I saw the truth and I just can't ignore
You're trying to hold the heart that can't be stored

Say I tried to give my best before
You wouldn't have the chance to give me more
You're only one step closer to the door

Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother
Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me
Everything is true to me, never words where you would see
Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother
I've been hating everything, everything that could have been
Could have been my anything, now everything's embarrassing

Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother
Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me
Everything is true to me, never words where you would see
Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried then I would not bother
I've been hating everything, everything that could have been
Could have been my anything, now everything's embarrassing
