I've been around and I'm just wishing on a star
I've travelled a long ways but I've never been this far
I've seen the world with my eyes never did I know
But I'm gonna find a way no matter what they say

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - of the world

I've been around and I'm just wishing on a star
I've travelled long ways but I've never been this far
I've seen the world with my eyes never did I know
But I'm gonna find a way no matter what they say

There are times when I just wanna lay down on the ground
And never rise again no matter what's been found
But then I realise I have to carry on
And I try to move along to the rivers full of joy

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - of the world

So many people pass me by without a sign
I try to catch them but I don't know if it's right
As far as I can see I still got much to learn
I have to find a way no matter what they say

It's time to wake up now 'cause much is still undone
I made up my mind and nothing gets me down
And I won't stop this time until I'm really through
I have to move along to the rivers full of joy

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - of the world

In the rivers of joy
Rivers of joy oh

And now when I know myself
I see it all so clear there's nothing more to fear yeah

You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm you come across
So hear me when I say you're here to stay
Hold on tight and I'll be right
You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm just happiness
You just take a look deep down in the rivers of joy

In the rivers of joy joy - the rivers of joy
In the rivers of joy joy
In the rivers of joy joy - hey
In the rivers of joy joy

In the rivers of joy halleluja
In the rivers of joy
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - all the happiness
Hallelujah joy - of the world
In the rivers of joy
