[Verse 1:]

I´m the kinda girl who´s something like a diamond
Cost a lot, and it´s hard to find one
This is might be a day you won´t forget no
I´ll have you doing things you won´t regret, so

If you wanna see my wild side (Wanna see my wild side)
Here´s the rules that apply (Keep your eyes on me all the times)
You gotta let me run the show (I´m a trained professional)
Make him roar, beg for more
Not too much, get down boy

[Chorus:]

You´re used to your way
Boy, it´s a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it
Ju ju just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it

Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down

[Verse 2:]

Seems like you´re scared of a challenge
Looks like you´re nervous, boy quit all that whinin´
You´re not used to one who´ll take the time to tame you
Guarantee that you´ll be whipped soon as I get through

If you wanna see my wild side (Wanna see my wild side)
Here´s the rules that apply (Keep your eyes on me all the times)
You gotta let me run the show (I´m a trained professional)
Make him roar, beg for more
Not too much, get down boy

[Chorus:]

You´re used to your way
Boy, it´s a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it
Ju ju just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it

Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down

[Break:]

I´m gon´ throw it back, boy
Cuz you been a bad boy
Teach you tricks and show you how to act
How to act, uh huh huh

[Chorus:]

You´re used to your way
Boy, it´s a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it
Ju ju just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon´ like it

Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
