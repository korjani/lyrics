Maybe it´s the way you used to love me
Maybe it´s the way I feel you now
I´m feeling like the sky is fallin on me
And my life is tumbeling down

Maybe I´m lost in the moment
I don´t wanna be found
Feel like I must save the moment

Maybe I´m a fool for lovin you
Maybe you´re right and maybe I´m wrong
Maybe cause I don´t know what to do
Won´t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn´t matter anyway
It´s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

Maybe one day I win the lottery
Maybe I´ll be poor all my life
And there so many possibilities
All I got to do is try try try

But I´m still lost in this feeling
Now I wanna be found
Can anyone stop me from falling

Maybe I´m a fool for lovin you
Maybe you´re right and maybe I´m wrong
Maybe cause I don´t know what to do
Won´t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn´t matter anyway
It´s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

I won´t be waiting I can´t be waisting no more time
Cause I got dray the line sometime
No second guessing it´s only messing with my lige
I don´t want it anymore no

Maybe I´m a fool for lovin you
Maybe you´re right and maybe I´m wrong
Maybe cause I don´t know what to do
Won´t somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn´t matter anyway
It´s just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all
