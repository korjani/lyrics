(Movin', movin', movin', movin')

We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.

I'm Movin' through fields of devotions,
If you meet me there you will know what I feel.
Don't be afraid to get lost this time,
You got to relax and be fulfilled.

[Chorus]
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
(Movin'!)
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
(Yeah, yeah!)

I do mind if you keep it under control,
'Cos you've got to give me what I really need.
If I'm gonna make my way through this confusion,
You've got to be out there willing to please.

[Chorus]

Keep movin' and moving and moving and moving, don't stop!
Movin' and moving and moving and moving, don't stop!
Movin' and moving and moving and moving
Keep movin' and movin' and movin' and movin' and
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Chorus]

We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
We are livin' in a Move Mania, movin' people that's what we are.
(Moving...)
