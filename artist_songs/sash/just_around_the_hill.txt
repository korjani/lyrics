What if the world was out of trouble
What if the world was out of pain
Would it be a world thats worth living in
Without anything
Thats worth a sin

What if the world was out of hope
Would you find a place where you belong
You said to yourself that you'd never make it that far
And the mountains too high
The answer is

Just around the hill
Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you see
There are many ways
Don't go astray
Just walk around
Walk around that hill

What if the world was out of love
And all that we do don't mean a thing
You take a chance
No suffering
No suffering
For anything
You're risking yourself
Do you really want it that way?
The mountains too high
The answer is

Just around the hill
Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you see
There are many ways
Don't go astray
Just walk around
Walk around that hill
Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you'll see
There are many ways
To go astray
Just walk around
Walk around that hill
Walk around that hill
Hmmm
Walk around that hill
