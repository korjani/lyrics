Life
Mysterious life
Where we're moving around, dancing the rhythm of life.

Time
Mysterious time
Where we're counting the hours and days to the end of our time.

And we're feeling the change and we don't know why
Choose one direction just one more time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind.

[Chorus]
And these are Mysterious Times
Mysterious Times
No trick of the mind
For this moment I feel like we live in Mysterious Times.
If you see what's behind, these are Mysterious Times.

Soul
I feel my soul
For this moment nobody can stop me from flying so high.

Real
Nothing is real
In a world of illusion you only see what you feel.

And we're feeling the change and we don't know why
Choose one direction just one more time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind.

[Chorus]
If you see what's behind, these are Mysterious Times.
