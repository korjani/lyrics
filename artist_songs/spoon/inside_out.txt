Time's gone inside out
Time gets distorted with
This intense gravity
I don't got time for holy rollers
Though they may wash my feet
And I won't be their soldier

There's intense gravity in you
(There's intense gravity in you)
I'm just your satellite
(I'm just your satellite)

Ooh, and I know that time's gone inside out
And now it's only like I told you
Mmm, though they may wash my feet
They do not make me complete

Break out of character for me
Time keeps on going when
We got nothing else to give
We got nothing else to give

Ooh, cause our time's gone inside out
I don't make time for holy rollers
Mmm, there's only you I need
They do not make me complete
