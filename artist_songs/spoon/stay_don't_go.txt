Keep believing the things that you tell yourself
Everyone needs something they can tell themselves
To hold on to cause after all of it's said and done

Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh now stay don't go

At times you find that the truth is the best way out
Sometimes telling the truth is the best way out
And it's the wrong words that make you prick upi your ears
When later alone

Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh now stay don't go
