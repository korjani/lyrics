I want to settle this bet and I don't want your shoulder instead
The minor tough's walking past again
A pure extension yeah
Reach in your pocket and pull out the pantleg of hate
Reach in your pocket and pull out the pantleg of hate
The hardcore will tell me not to say so
But now Keora where did your sadness go
You know I would go try and get through to you
If you weren't down at the back room
They're standing up the block and down the street
And they'll be out all night yeah
As I'm out in the car it comes to me
They're breaking up inside
