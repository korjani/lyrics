Don't say a word
The last one's still stinging
Back of my mind
I feel that phone ringing
And there is no way back from this

Everything hits at once
What we needs is just what we wants
I go to sleep but think that you're next to me
I go to sleep and think you're next to me

Don't make a move
When I walk out don't follow me
Out in the car
Can feel it calling me
And ooh you're so far away

But I can still change my mind tonight
I gotta change my mind somehow
I go to sleep alone but think that you're next to me
Everything hits at once tonight
Outside is all lit up with ad lights
In traffic we become on the way back home
Part of something bigger than just on our own

I gotta change my mind tonight
I can still change my mind tonight
Merging in traffic cross the lanes and then we become
Something bigger than just anyone
Oh and everything hits at once
What we needs is just what we wants
I go to sleep and think that you're next to me
I go to sleep but think that you're next to me
