I've gone out of my way
Big, blank slate every day
Big blank, canvas staring at me every day

Revenge
Revenge
Revenge

Push pin stuck in
I've got stuck in

The word's out
I'm not sure where I am
How I'm gonna get back where I am
What the real purpose is what I want
What I want to reveal

Stuck in Dallas with the lavalette
Gotta blink kids are staring at me like a set
I fucked up, now I just won again

(Revenge, Revenge, Revenge) I'm not sure where I am
(Revenge, Revenge, Revenge) How I'm gonna get back where I am
(Revenge, Revenge) What the real purpose is what I want
(Revenge, Revenge) What I want to reveal
