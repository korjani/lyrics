I cut my fingers on the way
The way I'm slipping away

And they're looking alright

Keep on blowin up
Keep on blowin em off

Keep on showin em out

Y'hit me like a tom
It hit me like a tom
On and on a tom

I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
I feel me slippin away
I wipe my feelings off
Y'made me untouchable for life

It hit me like a tom-tom
