When the matches burn into dust
Someone's always gotta be sweeping them up
You done yours, yeah
I know I done mine
You caught a break when I gave you the time
Tell us now, little man, what's what
You're the one that had to go show his stuff
You're the one that brought a shotgun
Yes, you went and brought a shotgun

How many times did you come back and quit?
How many times were you not feeling it?
Calling for blood with your battle song
I'd rather not, got my own thing on
I never wanted to take it outside
You're the one that had to go bring that fight
Oh, you're the one that brought a shotgun
You went and brought a shotgun
You're the one that brought a shotgun
Yeah, you went and brought a shotgun

Another year comes
Another year comes
But nothing's gonna stop it
Nothing's gonna stop it
Another year comes
Another year comes
And nothing gonna stop it
Nothing gonna stop it, oh

I shoot straight, my words elemental
Old school South Side like Rock and Roll Rentals
Back when we couldn't afford the Continental
You and me dreaming 'bout full medical and dental
I never wanted to take it outside
Then you brought what you did to the fight

You're the one that brought a shotgun
Yes, you went and brought a shotgun
You're the one that brought a shotgun
You're the one that made it no fun
You're the one that brought a shotgun
Yeah, you went and brought a shotgun
You're the one that brought a shotgun
You went and brought a shotgun
