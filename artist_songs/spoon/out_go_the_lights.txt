You walk into the ballroom like 
The cough, the wind, the rain was right 
And all them heads went left to right 
Then out with the lights 
It was a break in time 
I know your mechanisms 

You became like that 
One which your heart was fixed 
Before I knew what was which 
Out with the lights 

There's a picture of you 
Standing there in my black wig 
Looking like, who thinks they know who 
Standing there in my black wig 
I came here for the noise 
You always look good that way 
You with the one-two punch from Illinois 

If you lean any harder 
That window breaks at the bone 
And when that light turns back again 
You will remember the way 
They fall for you like a brick 
Oh but nobody loves you 
Or woos you when you're down or kicked 

Out go the lights 
Never see that counterpoint 
You always look good that way 
You with the one-two punch 
You always look good that way
