This is the electric lounge
No one's afraid to laugh
They say c'mon, man
Just let me break your back
Talk about the medellin
And what's on tap
What else you come here for
What else could this be about
Well for me I'm just waiting for the kid to come out
And I'm waiting for the kid to come out
And I'm finding out what this is about
Waiting for the kid to come out
Let it bleed

In the tradition of your nationalized tracts
Outside between the bands
Everything comes back out
It's hard to put down
What you can't hold back
And this is like being alive
It flows right out of your mouth
Here at the electric lounge
Outside between the bands
No one's afraid to laugh
Because you'll get just what you've come to expect
You can stick all that up your ass
Because me I'm just waiting for the kid to come out
And I'm waiting for the kid to come out
And I'm finding out what this is about
And I'm waiting for the kid to come out
Let it bleed
