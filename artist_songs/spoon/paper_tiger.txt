I'll never hold you back
And I won't force my will
I will no longer do the devil's wishes
Something I read on a dollar bill
A paper tiger can't tell you where he stands
We'll go back tonight the way that we came
I'm not dumb, just want to hold your hand

So alright
Where we want to be
And alright
What that we could be

We could go kick down some doors together
Stay out til morning sharp as knives
The new war will get you it will not protect you
But I will be there with you when you turn out the light
Said I will be there with you when you turn out the light
I will be there with you when you turn out the light
