Always on the outside
Always looking in
I was in this drop D metal band we called Requiem
And they'd say relax
But I can't be a man this far down on the map

I saw sold for suspect drawings
Underneath the makeshift awnings
Now I'm yours
Know I'm here
Read it all front and back
But I can't relax
With my knees on the ground and a stick in my back
Sister Jack

I was on the outside
I was lookin in
I was in a drop D metal band we called Requiem
And I can't relax
With my knees on the ground and a stick in my back
Sister Jack

No I can't just relax
Knowing that you're coming back
Sister Jack
