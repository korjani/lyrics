I'm on a straight line when a man comes around
And he got lines in the suit
Coming out to make us moot
I'm moving on now if I like it or not
He says I've got nowhere to go
Tell me something I don't know
He's painting it out like I don't want to know

The picture has come down
I'm taking it off and throwing it out
The picture is about what could have been easier
The picture is coming around now
How come I feel so washed up
At such a such a tender age now
How come I feel so washed up
The picture is coming around now
It could have been easier
At such a such a tender age

I'm listening to the comforting sound
Of some kind of work being done outside
Of sounds from next door the walls don't hide
I'm listening to mountain to sound
And the way it's panned is cool
But when I get back home to you
There's got to be something more than that too

The human resource clerk
Has two cigarettes and back to work
She eats right but hurts
And she says it could have been good by now
It could have been more than a wage yeah
How come she feels so washed up
At such a such a tender age now
It could have been easier
It could have been more than a wage
How come she feels so washed up at such a tender age

I'm on a straight line and a man comes around
And I got nowhere to go
Come back and tell something I don't know
