Whenever your love can find me
It break through the walls that bind me
It's breaking the walls that bind me

And I go out in the world
I make my case to the world
I sell the world unto the world
It asks me back again
It calls me Love and holds me tight

It peels off them ties that bind me
I don't need a thing to remind me
That I'm part of the world
I saw the light

I saw the light
And I felt all creamed on in white
I felt so permanently alive

I saw the light
I saw the light
And I felt all creamed on in white
I felt so permanently alive

I saw the light
I saw the light
I saw the light
And I felt all creamed on in white
I felt so permanently alive
