Goodnight Laura, don't you know 
Your bed awaits and now it's time for sleeping?

Goodnight Laura, close your eyes
You words are meant to stop at night 
You know they're not for keeping

If you want to fall asleep be very still
And you close your eyes, and slow yourself
And let the worry leave you, and let go if it all just for this evening

Alright 
Alright

You can fall asleep by being very still
As you let your breath slow down 
And when you think your thoughts be sure that they are sweet ones 
They are sweet ones

Don't you know, Laura, you're alright?
You're alright
