Small stakes give you blues
But you don't feel taken don't think you've been used
Cause it's alright Friday night to Sunday
It feels alright keeps your mind on the page

Oh yeah small stakes ensure you the minimum blues
But you don't feel taken and you don't feel abused
Small stakes tell you that there's nothing can do
Can't think big, can't think past one or two

Me and my friends sell ourselves
Short but feel very well
We feel fine

Small time danger in your midsize car
I don't dig the stripes but I'll go for har mar
The big innovation on the minimum wage
Is lines up your nose but your life on the page so c'mon
Tell me I'm wrong

Small stakes will kill time
When you're stuck in back of the line
It feels alright Friday night to Sunday
Aw it feels alright keeps your mind on the page

And small stakes bring you where you're caught in a rut
You feel so uptight you just want to throw it all up
And small stakes leave you with the minimum blues
Can't think big, can't think past one or two so c'mon
