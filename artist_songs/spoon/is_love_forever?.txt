I grew up in a supermarket it was there they told me
If they can't find me they won't leave without me
Now or ever
All I need's a word to get me started, all I need's a look
Some ex-girlfriend, call her Heather
Whispers to me "Is love forever?"
Is love forever?
Is love?

Are you quite certain, love?

When I'm older, start to wonder was that love or instinct working?
Have I even felt it ever?
What's the object?
Is love forever?
