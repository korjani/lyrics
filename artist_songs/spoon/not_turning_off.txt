She's gone in a word, and tanked-up
And I can't sleep at all, I can't sleep at all
She's gone in a word, the ephedrine
Got caught halfway down, the pretty anti-ground
Don't wanna miss such an american scene
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
Oh honey, please, it's just a machine
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
There's something about, you're up late
Your can tastes like tin, aluminum
There's something about, I'm not the only one
That can't sleep at all
That can't sleep at all
And I don't want to miss such an american scene
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
I said to myself I'm not turning off
Well I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
So connect, connect, connect, connect to me
Connect, connect, connect, connect to me
Oh honey, oh please it's just a machine
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine
It's just a machine
