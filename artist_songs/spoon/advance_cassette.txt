Getting caught has made me think it over
And it told me that you're never coming back here again
We've been doing things the same way for so long
That it took me aback
And I don't think I'll ever hear that sad song again
Don't tell me I've lost you
Advance cassette
I just can't believe it
No don't say that I've lost you
Advance cassette
I just can't believe it
You'll know by the look on their faces when they pass you
You've been dropped off on the texas highway
I've been out here for so long that I'm not sure
How you wound me so tight
I'm afraid I won't ever hear that sad song again
So don't tell me I've lost you
Advance cassette
Oh no I just can't believe in it
No don't say that I've lost you
Advance cassette
I just can't believe it
