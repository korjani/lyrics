I could see your words hang in the air
But they did not spell out what I thought that I heard
I could see the dude in your next room by himself
So I took one look around walked back out

Now the snot has caked into my pants
It's a good bet that it will soon turn to crystal form
So take it off and take it off again
As the crackers watch you take it off again
