Picture yourself
Set up for good in a whole other life
In the mystery zone

Make us a house
Some far away town
Where nobody will know us well
Where your dad's not around
And all the trouble you look for all your life
You will find it for sure
In the mystery zone

Times that we met
Before we met
Times that we met
We'll go there
To the mystery zone
Ah the mystery zone

There goes the rider
At gates of dawn
He takes no prisoners at all
He'll be there on his own

What gets him gone
Off down that road
Is something he don't understand
Ooh! The mystery zone

Maybe all he wants
Maybe all he needs
Is to know that the sun don't set
On the mystery zone

How come it feels so familiar
When you never been there?
How come it seems so unreachable
You never tried to find
Never tired to find the mystery zone
Mystery zone, oooh!

All of the people
You used to run into but never do now
They took off for the mystery zone

And when you know love
When you find it for real
It contains the emotion sense of
Everyone ready
Your cover was blown
You weren't there but you were
Ooh in the mystery zone
You weren't there but you were
You weren't there but you were

Openin' windows
Doors never close it's the fresh air fiend
It's the information troll

We'll pack a bag
Sendin' it off just some things that never fit right
To the m...
And we'll send it ahead as a test so we'll know
Call it up when it gets there
"What's it like in the mystery zone?"

The times that we met
Before we met
We'll go back there
Oh, times that we met
We'll go back
We'll go back there
The mystery zone
To the mystery zone
The mystery zone
Oh the mys...
