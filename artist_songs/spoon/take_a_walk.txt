Tough break handjob broke it all right in two
And it won't get back together with stitches and glue
And now that song's been sung
It's just the cost of what's been done
The cost of taking a walk with you

I can tell myself
This is for all concerned's health
And I may yet dot that I
Fill it up and pour it down the inside

And tell you all go and take a walk
And I said all y'all go take a walk

Tough break handjob sent me back home to ma
Back to cowtown and the fish shop and the mall

Oh yeah it sent me right back from where I came
And in the interim nothing changed
So I may yet dot that i
Fill it up and pour it down the inside

Until you all go and take a walk
And I said all y'all go take a walk
