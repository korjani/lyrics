Catacomb catacomb be my security
Count it off count it off be my big sister
I walked for forty-six blocks
You've been putting it off but come on
I've got meat in my arms
I've got steel in my teeth so come on
Making out taking out
It's utilitarian
Heartache adulate
The utilitarian
Oh yeah we're in love with this perverted world so come on
When I walk down the steps I'm just halfway across the world
