All the pretty girls go to the city
Don't they don't they do my love
Oh itr's something to see they're so pretty
High heel shoes low neck sweaters acting so tough

Hear em go do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do

And they know that they'll make it alright

I say don't they now don't they now don't they my love
Don't they now don't they now don't they my love

Jacqueline and Beth went to the city now
Left home soon as they were old enough
Cause all the pretty girls go to the city now
Don't they don't they do don't they do that my love

And they go do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do

I said don't they now don't they now don't they my love
Don't they now don't they now don't they my love
