All lines are read, the film is done
After hours is on and now they'll make another one
If you miss the meaning this time
Well here comes another one

And if you clap your hands, the man will fall
Hold your breath, he'll shake himself to death
And scenes get rearranged
When words are said

Every day I hear knock, knock, knock
Oh, and it's you
Oh, every day I hear knock, knock, knock

Then I see you and you're shaking
And you're breaking
And you tell me I'm your only friend
And it starts all over again

You said you were living in a buttoned-up world
Living in 1892
Aw, there was nothing they could say to convince me
To blame nobody but you

And your hand is on the trigger and you know it's gonna blow
But you don't give a damn, don't care who's gonna know
You just want everyone to talk slow
And give you consent

Every time I hear knock, knock, knock
I know that it's you
Oh, every day I hear knock, knock, knock

And I see you and you're shaking
Oh, you're breaking
So I put down the poison pen
And it starts all over again

And it starts all over again
