There's a girl in my yard
Reading me my tarot cards
She don't know anything
But she's beautiful to me

My eyes are opening again
I see you as you're marching in
I'll bring you cover when you're cold
You'll bring me youth when I grow old

Do you when remember when you were small
How everybody would seem so tall
I am your shadow in the dark
I have your blood inside my heart
