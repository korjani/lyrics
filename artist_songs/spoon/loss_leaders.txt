I get up and all I've got on my mind is thinking up brand new chords
Then fred hampton comes on and takes it all back it brings me back to earth
Sha - no - ma everything I knew and loved about you
Sha - no - ma so I could get through I've put them all away

Loss leaders, yeah, it's just the sounds that you make go right inside of me
It makes us immortal like god cannibal club takes all our icons on
Sha - no - ma everything I knew and loved about you
Sha - no - ma so I could get through I've put them all up
Sha - no - ma tears fell down inside

Fred tried to change their ways 'til he got some bullet holes now he lives in outer space
