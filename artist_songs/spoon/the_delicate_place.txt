I got nothing
You got something
I feel out of place
Looking through your window
Into the delicate place
Reflections stating obvious mating holds

I'll own up to you if you own up to me
I'll picture for you if you picture for me

Have you got the answer
Have I yet won the part
Is this just your way of breaking my heart
Everyone denies it but they just to be told

I'll hold it for you if you hold it for me
I'll picture for you if you picture for me
The delicate place
The questions it raise
The delicate place

I got nothing
You got something
I feel out of place
Looking through that window
Into the delicate place

I'll own up to you if you own up to me
I'll picture for you if you picture for me
The delicate place
The questions it raise
The delicate place yeah
