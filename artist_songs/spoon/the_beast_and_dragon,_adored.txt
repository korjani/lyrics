The beast and dragon, adored
You been gone so long
Where you been for so long
I went to places unknown
Rented a room
And i forgot my pen
Shook my twin
And I had to find the feelin again

Now all I need is a crew
One that can act as if
One that can slay on cue
And sneeze and sniff
Uh-huh alright
I'm going back to the water
Been landlocked too long

I got a feelin it don't come cheap
I got a feelin oh and then it got to me
It took its time a-working into my soul
I got to believe it come from rock and roll
Believe it come from rock and roll

Where did you get for so long
I been learning my scene
I been watching my friends move away
I summon my love back to me
And I went down by the seawall
That's when I knew, knew They Never Got You

Great dominions, they don't come cheap
Great dominions, they just want you to leave
I got the meaning the meaning sat tight
Said it's not what you expected but it could be right

I got a feelin it didn't come free
I got a feelin and then it got to me
When you don't feel it it shows they tear out your soul
And when you believe they call it rock and roll
