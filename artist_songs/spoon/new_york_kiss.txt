Yes, I got shook up
But bets are good
It took it to another 'til I go back

Now when I show up
It's gonna hit me good
It's gonna blow my mind
Just like the first time
You told me by the neon sign

And then your New York kiss
I knew your New York kiss
Now it's another place
A place your memory owns

I come fast
I look past
And I know that it won't get to me at all
Until I go there
And then it hits me clear and sharp
The streets are empty, there's no one 'round
It's a far-off shout, it's a far-off shout
Just like it was when next day came up
And it felt so tough

From your New York kiss
Mmm, your New York kiss
Now it's just another place
A place your memory owns

Another place that you own
And it ain't goin' back
Caught up inside of it, yeah
Caught up in the moment
Got it right
Oh there ain't a thing I miss

Not like your New York kiss
Not like your New York kiss
But now it's just another place
A place your memory owns

Right now I know no other time
Right now I know no other place
I say good night
