We was walking through the park
Trying to get home before too dark
Who was it that we saw that night
Was it you?

Someone doing something not right
Shocked to see us interrupting their delight
Who was it that we saw that night
Was it you?

Tucked away inside of the wood
Tucked away inside and up to no good
Who was it that we saw that night
Was it you?

And we was cutting through the park
Trying to get home before too dark
Who was it that we saw that night
Was it you?
