You were out walking the park
I was at the owl cafe
When the sirens rang
And no we're never gonna meet
But I feel you anyway
I was trying to get out of town
You passed in an ambulance
We were in a trance
And now we're never gonna meet
But I feel you anyway
Yeah, I feel you today

Let them build a wall around us
I don't care, I'm gonna tear it down
It's just bricks and ill intentions
They don't stand a chance
I'll tear it down

Signals you send
Secrets you would never tell
People you've been
People you bend to your will
Darkness comes on
And lingers past the dawn
Tension, it lends
Tensions, tension, tension waiting

Let them build a wall around us
I don't care, I'm gonna tear it down
It's just bricks and ill intentions
They don't stand a chance
I'll tear it down
Mmm, tear it on down
Mmm

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, I'll tear it down
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, I'll tear it down

You were just getting off work
I was down at the city stacks
When the sky went black
And now we're never gonna meet
But I feel you anyway
Yeah, I feel you today

Let them build a wall
I don't care, I'm gonna tear it down
It's just bricks and ill intentions
They don't stand a chance
I'll tear it down
Mmm, tear it on down
