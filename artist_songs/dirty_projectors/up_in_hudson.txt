[Roberta Flack:]
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes

The first time ever I saw your face, laid my eyes on you
Was the Bowery Ballroom stage, you were shredding Marshall tubes
And I knew that I had to get to know
You, why don't you pack your clothes?
Move to Brooklyn on your own
And join the band, come on the road

We talked for like two minutes
But I had a feeling
Something awkward but new between us
Something strong and appealing

And we both had girl and boyfriends blowing us up SMS
But we both knew a mood like this so strong would be wrong to suppress
Felt like it bore the impress of destiny
In a minivan in New England, our eyes met
We said yes and we said yes

Love will burn out
Love will just fade away

First time I ever kissed your mouth, we both felt time stop
My heart, it leapt up, wow, jumped from a mountaintop
Then I knew: maybe I could be with you
Do the things that lovers do
Slightly domesticate the truth
And write you "Stillness Is the Move"

The ceilings that we ignored
The slept-on floors never ending
Our feeling obscured but pure
And our love ascending

This is how we saw the world, side by side from the road and the stage
So our lives were twined and curled and mixed up like the code we obeyed
And that was basically my dream and I dreamed it with you 'til we betrayed it

And love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate

Now we're going our separate ways
But we're still connected
You'll go forward and I'll stay the same
And that's how it breaks
Wash it away, wash it away
All of the pain, all of the pain and anger
It slips away, love slips away
But it will remain, it will remain unanswered

Now I'm listening to Kanye on the Taconic Parkway, riding fast
And you're out in Echo Park, blasting 2Pac, drinking a fifth for my ass
I'm just up in Hudson bored and destructive knowing that nothing lasts

'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
Yeah love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
