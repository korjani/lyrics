When the child was just a child
It did not know what it was
Like a child it had no habits
No opinion about anything

Maybe I will get a job
Get a job as a waitress
Maybe waiting tables in a diner
In some remote city down the highway

After all that we've been through
I know we'll make it after the wait
The question is a truth
There is nothing we can't do
I'll see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move

On top of every mountain 
There was a great longing
For another even higher mountain
In each city longing for a bigger city

After all that we've been through
I know that I will always love you
From now until forever baby
I can't imagine anything better

Isn't life under the sun just a crazy, crazy, crazy dream?
Isn't life just a mirage of the world before the world, before the world?
Why am I here and not over, over, over there?
Where did time begin
Where does space end
Where do you and I, where do you and I begin?
