Heaven knows we've been to hell
Heavy, hard, and far -- how we fell
And we overwhelmed ourselves in fighting and yelling
Losing and finding dreams we held

But now the spell is shattered
And now we are on earth

Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you

(This)
This is the way
(That)
We will change
(Time)
The ocean wave
(The pain)
We will embrace

And what held us together
Is what tears apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
And it's going to get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love that we made is the art

And now it is getting late
It's time to say the projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you

We won't be afraid to grow
We won't be afraid to grow
What we gave, we will always retain
I remember and I will remain
Proud and glad you were in my life

Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you

Time passes away
There'll be other lovers
Forward and into it
Future imagined by neither of us

And what held us together
Is what tears apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
It's going to get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art

And now it is getting late
It's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late
It's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late
It's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I can see you
