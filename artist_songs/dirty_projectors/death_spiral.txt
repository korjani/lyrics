Hold up, I was reborn the second before the
Plane became shards of glass
And ash when it crashed on arrival I woke up
Feeling like I'm sipping on some René Descartes
And you're Big Gulping the Bible
Your wings are broken so we fly in a spiral
All I have is my love of love
But now you wanna blow us up
You're so rock 'n' roll suicidal

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

You spin me around
In a wild death spiral
We're hitting the ground
In a fiery pile
Whose fault I couldn't fly
For the dials, only by the eye
Now the ring is on fire
Now it's final
Death spiral

What can we say? It's too late
We can't rewind to when we were both open and amazed
Like a wide-eyed child's smile
But it's the end, we're enemies, not friends
I don't know your state of mind, mine's good, bye

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

You spin me around
In a wild death spiral
We're hitting the ground
In a fiery pile
Whose fault I couldn't fly
For the dials, only by the eye
Now the ring is on fire
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral
Death
Our love is a
Death
My love is a
Death
Our love is in a spiral
Death spiral
Our love is a
Death
My love is a
Death
Our love is in a spiral
Death spiral
Spiral
Death spiral
Spiral

This isn't 'bout the time you chased me down the street
Face a rictus of misery and pain
You grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Or how I never learned to let you breathe
Condescended relentlessly
These threads need disentangling
So we have thread left to weave

Now our love is spiraling finally down
Now our helix is widening, coming unbound

You spin me around
In a wild death spiral
We're hitting the ground
In a fiery pile
Whose fault I couldn't fly
For the dials, only by the eye
Now the ring is on fire
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral
Death
Your love is a
Death
My love is a
Death
Our love is in a spiral
Death spiral
Your love is a
Death
My love is a
Death
Our love is in a spiral
Death spiral
Your love is a
Death
My love is a
Death
Our love is in a spiral
Death spiral
Spiral
Death spiral
Spiral
