Mornings I wake up hung over
Lower than mornings before
I don't know memories tortured
Or maybe what I deserve
Lonely and forgotten in the frozen world
Scorned in my desire
Ignored by all the girls
I need someone to comfort me

Whose hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide openly)
Whose eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing

Everywhere I go I see her
Everywhere I look she disappears
Every time I think I've found her
Just what I've found is unclear

So onward through the murk and the uncertainty
Sifting through the days patient and carefully
Always to get to where she is

Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Her mouth is smiling (wide openly)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing

Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing

But you can't see me

Tell me the way to the orchid
Tell me the way and I'll be there
Give me a day to go forward
Give me your hand and we'll go there

Forward through the clover and the bergamot
Shoreward to the gulls and to the guillemots 
Horizon alone among the wind

Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide openly)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing

Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah 
I can see what she seeing
