When I've had enough, when I've heard enough from police and pretenders
When I'm ready for my whole world to open up and surrender
I'll look for you, I will be searching the garden and the street
I will look into the eyes of everyone I meet

And when I finally find you, will I know?
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome

Far beyond here, far removed from the sneering of the crowd
My eternal love sits smiling, sphinx-like and proud
Cross that disguise, I am glancing with needles in my eyes
Birds of infinity glisten, shimmering for the rest of my life
And I conceived them, not what they mean

Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome

Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
