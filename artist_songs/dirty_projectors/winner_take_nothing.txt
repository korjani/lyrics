I'm living at the Ace
You're sleeping late in our apartment
It's just been 808s for the eight days since our restart went heartbreak

I am afraid, I've been all in on works and not grace
Thought we'd invest and save
But it's all rigged, a gamble and a waste

Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take nothing

I want it all and I want it more
Baby, I wanted our dream
And when you're no longer asleep
We'll go to Five Leaves
I built my life around our love to ground your dreamworld
I held so tight
But I never could give you enough

Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take nothing

Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take

We spent all those years in McCarren
Watching the green leaves turn brown again
We walked on Manhattan Ave. while the Dollar Tree turned New American
And as much as I'd like to say we both won
As much as I'd like to say I'm grateful for the experience
That we've grown together and bettered each other
And built the city with one another
The truth is you'd sell out the waterfront for condos and malls
I'd throw the dice with the rest of 'em
Down on Broad Street and Wall
This has turned me against myself
In losing you, I lost myself
That's the why the winner takes nothing else

Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take
Nothing

Fighting we can only lose
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Killing me and killing you
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
Winner take
Nothing
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
Winner take
Nothing
Nickel dull and so opaque
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take nothing
