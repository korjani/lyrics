You're alone
Even though you're the same
As everyone
With your ketchup blood and your changeable flame
I go out for a walk
Back way through the fog to the moon with who I talk

I am so myself, I am no one else
You are one who helped me and took my help

I fly fluid and remade
Ascending through the clouds and joining the constellation
There was never more than now
Urge and urge again, newly took and new endowed

I am not contained
In my chest or in my brain
I am energy unconstrained

And even though I want to
I find it hard to stay
In constant contact
Sometimes I go away
Sometimes I go away

Solitude becomes alienation
(The feeling of weariness)
And leads you to togetherness
(The slide in between pain and bliss)
Pleasure slides into pain
(The surrender to forgiveness)
And into pleasure again
(The happy acceptance of a kiss)
Forgiveness, need, apology
(Inevitability)
Redemption and surrendering
(Of sadness)
Strangers become friends
(The river washing us away)
And then strangers again
(Washing the garbage too and trash)
I become you and you become me
(Love and gratitude for the)
Suddenly we are not who we were
(Opportunity)
Passion and intellect combine
(One more chance maybe)
In human love
(To see the sun raise)
Highest common denomination

Even though I want to
I find it hard to stay in constant contact
I gotta go my own way
