The renegade feelin' satisfied
You blinked and closed your eyes
You like the feeling of Saturday
You love the danger in the night

The restless corpse is collapsing wind
The breath is daffodil
What won't be coming is lapsing 
Into the universal fill

Or maybe just no intention
Or maybe just no intention

When I am full with endeavor 
Nothing can stop gestalt
The freshness of my reality
Makes me feel tingly and hot

When you wake up shouting "Idea!"
Is that a punishment?
You represent saying "I'm real!"
but is that what you meant?

Maybe you meant no intention
Maybe you meant no intention

No intention
No intention
