I think she's the prettiest lady I've ever seen
Her hair it has meaning and volume and such a sheen
Sometimes, I think maybe I could go and talk to her
Her eyes, they look lonely for all way yeah and inner
Oh, baby 

The socialites, who act so nice
Will never begin to let you in
They'll act surprised, apologize
We'll never let on the face you wear is wrong

I'm gonna try combing my hair in a thousand ways
Maybe he will notice and maybe look my way
Oh baby, the other guys who act so nice
Will never begin to let you in
Stars in their eyes, they'll apologize
We'll never let on
When you meet someone real

But they don't know where I'm going
It's not impossible to show her
To show it, to open up

The socialites, who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
They'll act surprised, they'll apologize
Won't ever let on, the face you wear is all wrong

I'm glad they're the ones on the other side of the glass
Who knows what my spirit is worth in cold hard cash
Oh baby
