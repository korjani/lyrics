In the backyard
In the living room
Residential neighborhood
I've come for you

In the margins
Of the freeway
I have sat alone and wondered
Where are you?

Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon

In the medicine
In the weddings
Like the cormorant in evening
I see her silhouette
In the market
In the parking lot
In the uniform
You're nowhere now

Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon

Tossed aside the mirrored life
Echo it out, echo it out

Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
