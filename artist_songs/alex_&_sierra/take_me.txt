I’ve been trying to find you in the dark, in the dark
Middle of the night, I’m searching for the light
I’ve been trying to find you in the dark, in the dark
Middle of the night, I’m searching for the light
Searching for the light

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know I know that you’ll find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

I can feel you breathing, is this wrong? Is it right?
Do you ever see me when you close your eyes?
Still searching for the light

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know I know that you’ll find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

I would bleed my heart out
To find out what’s inside
Tell me with your heart, now
What’s inside your mind?

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know I know

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know I know that you’ll find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

Where do you go? Where do you go?
Can you take me? Can you take me?
