You hang your hand out the car window.
We travel by the roadway's hum.
See the signs pass.
Watch the fields go by.
Every mailbox.
Every streetlight.

Right here with me: exist amongst the wheat.
Amidst the leaves you watch listlessly.
To the key of evergreen, I listen to the whisper.

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea.
The rain will stop eventually.
I'll drive slow across black ice
And you'll be safe to rest your eyes.

Soon enough the sun will go down; but it's no bother, I'm not tired.
It's no bother.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea.
The rain will stop eventually.
I'll drive slow across black ice
And you'll be safe to rest your eyes.

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea.
The rain will stop eventually.
I'll drive slow across black ice
And you'll be safe to rest your eyes.

My lovely...
My lovely...
You'll be safe to rest your eyes.
