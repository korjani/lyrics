"I heard the sound", the shout proclaimed
Now I'm here to praise poison
It's a Monday let me be mundane
How's there so much to speculate?
I can't stand to carry the weight

Call me “The Sound and the Fury”
Consider me dead and buried
I'm like the city's grime
No time for no crime

Praise poison

They fill your head with the devil and god
You're so bored, but there's a choice
You're screaming without a voice
They fill your head with the devil and god

Call me “The Sound and the Fury”
Consider me dead and buried
I'm like the city's grime
No time for no crime
