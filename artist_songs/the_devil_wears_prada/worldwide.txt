From Milwaukee to Memphis, Pittsburgh to Portland, Maine;
I'm a little restless, feeling like a need a change
By way of Brooklyn and up to Boston
I'm disenchanted, considering every option

I'm thinking and thinking
That being around here has me sinking
And while home is always best
My neighborhood in the Midwest

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo

Tokyo

Here's to folks in Michigan, back and forth to Chicago
Along the lake, within the snow

I'm thinking and thinking
That being around here has me sinking
And while home is always best
My neighborhood in the Midwest

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo

I need more nights in Paris, more time in Stockholm
Some days I will be careless trying to feel known
I need more nights in Paris, more time in Stockholm
Some days I will be careless trying to feel known

I want to get lost in you, Tokyo
I've got a lot to say to you, Tokyo
It's nostalgic and quiet, but louder than silence
I want to get lost in you, Tokyo

Tokyo
