Look before you leap, okay? 
Do you read me? 
May all your dreams come true 
He's standing by the door 
He's got something in his hands 
All the money's gone 
All the money's gone 
The days we spend, go on and on
Shift
Fucking youth
Working youth
May all your dreams come true 

A lot of people suffer 
From impotence 
All the money's gone
The days we spend go on and on 

Fucking youth 
Working youth 
Fucking youth 
Working youth
Fucking youth
Fucking youth
Working youth

You slept
Did I drift?
Do I dream? 
Do you read me? 
I'm not speaking 
Do you read me?
I dream

I dream

Sound today are you sound today
are you sound today?
Sound today are you sound today
are you sound today?
Today
These things don't happen
automatically
I dream
Edith moves each step
Fucking youth 
The days we spent go on and on
I dream
Do you read me?
