When the rats run riot
And the screen door slams
When the trees grow quiet
Nothing but cats and cans
When the breeze says try it
But you can hardly see
When your love has died
And you rat on me

I see your eyes in the half-light
I see the number on your wall
Endless strange things I see at night
You don't see anything at all

Shine a light into your soul
City streets so freezing cold
City shadows wander out
When they let the rats out
Rats
You call it love alright
That was the catch
A cold suicide
Let me place you in my past
With other precious toys
But if you're ever feeling low down in the fractured sunshine
I'll help you feel the noise

Shine down
You can go on home
Shine down
Go
Go

Rats
You're working overtime
You are the moon beyond your mind
When the rats run riot
And the screen door slams
When the world goes quiet
You'll know where I am

You could be my open road
You could be the reason why
You could ease my heavy load
But I want to freeze you out now

You can let it shine
Keep that in mind
When they let out a rat next time
You could move a little closer
Until you're leaning all up around my shoulder
See these shadows walk around
When they let the rats out
