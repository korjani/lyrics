[Thurston]
Here it comes again - out of the rain
Seems to have a new - kind of same
Been it playing on a - simple rhyme
The site comes alive and - speaks the mind
It turns to me and - it turns to gold
It turns to see a - the fast lane slow

It's been a way too long
It's been the way I gone
It's a-coasting on
To the west star

Looking out I thought I - saw it blink
Coming on to me - like a silver eye
Pick it up and - turn it on and
Head on out to a - western starland

It's been a man and gone (?)
Now it's a singing song
Like a western star
It's going my way

Looking out I'm back in - time to stay
Into the eastern - silent way (?)
Comes alive through - through and clearer (?)
Ghost arise to - dirty mirror (?)

You've been away too long 
It's been way too long
An eastern star is on
A disappearer
