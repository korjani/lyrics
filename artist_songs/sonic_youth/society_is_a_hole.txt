[Thurston]
Society is a hole
It makes me lie to my friends
It's running down my street
With white powers sneakers
On the beautiful beat of black feet
Society is a hole
It beats my friends big heads
My friends have big heads,
I can understand it
But I don't recommend it
You got big big hair
And everybody is scared
Society is a hole
It makes me lie to my friends
The assault of holy music
There's a slap in my face
My friends are girls wrapped in boys
We're living in pieces
I want to live in peace
Society is a hole
