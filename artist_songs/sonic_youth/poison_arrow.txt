Paintings they fall off the walls when you come
Traipsing in with your horse
Your six string guitar is a mess silver bullets
Hanging off yr dress

Now I remember what I meant to be-to replace
Your history
Who let that girl into this room-so innocent yet
Doomed

[Chorus:]
Who shot the poison arrow

Here she comes-yeh-shes playing hard to get
There she goes-a promise you can never forget

Mirrors, they black out and freeze when you pull
Me in too too deep
Everytime I handcuff you I know I come closer to
The truth

Now I remember whatI meant to say-to count
All my blessings today
Who let that girl into this room-so innocent
Yet doomed

[Chorus]
