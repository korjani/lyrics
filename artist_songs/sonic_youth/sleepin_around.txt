Sleepin' around sleepin' around
What will the neighbors say
Sleepin' around all over town
What will the neighbors say

[Chorus:]
What you did was wrong
What did you good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight

Sleepin' around sleepin' around
What will the neighbors do
Sleepin' around all over town
What will the neighbors do

[Chorus]

Sleepin' around sleepin' around
What will the neighbors think
Sleepin' around all over town
What will the neighbors think

[Chorus]
