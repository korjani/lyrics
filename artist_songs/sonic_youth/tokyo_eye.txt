[Thurston]
Tokyo eye, Tokyo crying somewhere
Seeking inside, supermen sighing nowhere
Seven to nine, luck is around this sun bear
Fur in the night, Kansai woman goes out
Soak in the eye, Osaka crying for you
Ship in the light, sing in the water sun dew
Ticket to die, ticket to ride the junk star
Shielded in white, Kansai girl in black dew

Tokyo eye, Tokyo crying somewhere
Seeking inside, supermen sighing nowhere
Soaking in my eye, soaking in my eye grey leaf
She dig to cry, she dig to cry love funny
Fur in the eye, Kansai girl is kiss teen
Fun in the light, crying away to sun bear
