Describe the touch, no it's the thought 
It's warm and yellow and has a ruffle 
It's warm and yellow and... 
He's so quiet I forgot he's there 
And I think here I am. 
"oh alice, come back he's just a kitten... 
He's just a kitten" 
A thousand leaves for your disguise fall on 
The sky and looking up from down is a sea to 
Realize the leaves are falling up and down 
Up and round. 
And this is from my heart to you 
A crazy wind will stir me too and contre de la 
Sexisme 
I am with you.
