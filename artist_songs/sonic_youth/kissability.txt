Look into my eyes, don't you trust me
Yr so good you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you want to
You could be a star
You could go far
You've got twistability
You fly hard, don't you wanna
You've got kissability
You could be a star, it ain't hard

Yr driving me crazy, I feel so sick
Yr driving me crazy, give us a kiss

Look into my eyes, don't you trust me
Yr so soft, you make me hard
I'll put you on a movie, don't you wanna
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got kissability
You sigh hard, don't you wanna
You've got twistability
You could be a star, it ain't hard

Yr driving me crazy, you smell so sick
I feel so tired, you made me sick
Yr driving me crazy, if I feel so sick
Yr driving me crazy, if I feel so sick

Look into my eyes, don't you dis' me
You're so good, you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got twistability
You fly hard, don't you wanna
You've got kissability
You could be a star, it ain't hard

You're driving me crazy, I feel so sick
You're driving me crazy, give us a kiss
