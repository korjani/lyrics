Guess who came round today
X-Girl and the girl snoo-pee
Twinkle toes and sparkle eyes
Everything is a new surprise
They're gonna spend some super-cash
Spend it all on the boy-smash
And all the glamour is all the time
Silver jacket and a twist of lime
Well hope you don't waste away
Yeah hope you don't waste away
You better not waste away
Ooh yeah don't waste away
I've seen it happen before
Girl slipping out the door
Sneaking into Agnes B.
Throw away everything
You've been a waste away
You've been a waste away
You've been a waste away, now

Walk up to her and say
I'd love you anyway
Sweet subtle super style
Wonder how to make an angel smile
Don't let me waste away
Don't let me waste away
Don't let me waste away
Don't let me waste away, wow!
