Can I have some money? I'm gonna go to the store
Can I have some money? I can't tell you what it's for
Can I have some money? you know it's you that I adore
Can I have some money? don't ask me what it's for

Since we've been together you've been good to me
You only hit me when you wanna be pleased

Can I have the car keys? I'm gonna go for a ride
Can I have the car please? I'm going out for a while
Can I have the car now? I wanna drive all around
Can I have the car dear? I'm gonna to leave this town

I won't be asking your permission to leave
I won't be asking not to have this baby please
And I won't be asking a devil for a bus fare please
And I won't be asking I had to see you bleed

Ssssssh
Visualize
That's right
Pray baby
One two three
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

Can I have my lipstick? that was such a surprise
Can I have my lipstick? I'm going out for a ride
I'm not a little girl, and you sure are not my dad
You don't even know what you almost had
