[Thurston]
You're perfect in the way, a perfect end today
You're burning out their lights, and burning in their eyes
I love you Sugar Kane, a-comin' from the rain
Oh kiss me like a frog, and turn me into flame
I love you all the time, I need you 8 to 9
And I can stay all night, yr body shining

And I know
There's something down there sugar soul
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There something down there sugar kane

I'm back again in love, I'm back again a dove
Where'd you get your light, your smilin' sugar life
Another lovers day, another cracked up night
Every night I say, the light is coming

And I know
There's something down there sugar cone
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There's something down there sugar kane

Hey angel come and play, and fly me away
A stroll along the beach, until you're out of time
I love you sugar kane, a crack into the dream
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar
