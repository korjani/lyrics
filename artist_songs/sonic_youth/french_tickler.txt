Free time, free time 
I have got it gonna get me some 
Free time, free time 
I would spend it forever captivated 
Free time, free time 
Would you tell me the secret of yr arm 
Free time, free time 
Forever fabulastic, blowup, pleasuristic 
I feel combustible 
That's my will say it all 
Mille feuille 
Mille feuille 
Mille feuille 
Now you better take a deep breath 
The smell is just the best 
I'll transform even yr breast 
You are my new weekend guest 
I can't believe this could happen to me 
Caught inside someone's knee 
Free time, free time 
Uncovered forever barest endeavor 
Free time, free time 
If you want me splash me forever 
Free time, free time 
Let it happen the leisure, enchanting 
Free time, free time 
Yr neck is my favorite pleeze don't spare it 
I feel combustible that's my will, say it all 
Now you better cough up the dough 
If you want to join the show 
Exotique is not for free 
Spend wisely eternity 
Engine of desire is on the road 
Don't get stuck without a job 
Free time, free time 
You have got it gonna get me some 
Free time, free time 
Wandering, fantastic, sparkling demanded 
Free time, free time 
Did I mention that you control me 
Free time, free time 
The merest endeavor slightly forever 
Mille feuille 
Mille feuille 
Mille feuille
