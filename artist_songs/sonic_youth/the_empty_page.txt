These are the words but not the truth
God bless them all when they speak to you
But that's alright
On an empty stage
Sing out when
There's no other way

Come drift the town where secrets lie
Where friends and neighbours keep drifting by
But that's alright
You're here to stay
Sing out tonight
The empty page

I always thought I'd see
Your name in flashing light
You did it all for free, girl
And freely ripped the night
You're free to fight

These are the words but not the truth
God bless them all when they speak to you
But that's alright
You're here to stay
Sing out tonight
The empty page

Do you remember the time
When you were new in town
You smashed your head in the mirror, baby
And kissed the frozen ground
Yr ripped up sound

The empty page has wasted down
The empty page is ripped
The empty page will waste this town
The empty page has slipped
