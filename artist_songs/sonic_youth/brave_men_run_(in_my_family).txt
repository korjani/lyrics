[Kim]
Seven days and seven nights
I dreamt a sailor's dream at sea
Seven days and seven nights
I dreamt a sailor's dream of me
Seven days and siven nights
The world was made and lost again
Seven days and seven nights
Brave men run
In my family
Brave men run
Into the setting sun
Brave men run
Into captivity
Brave men run
In my family

Brave men run
Away from me
