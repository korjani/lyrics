Never gonna ya do it 
A world below 
Heather angel you are somewhere 
On the show 
Don't you think you would find 
Where to go 
I want to go dancing on the other side 
I want to buy a phonograph 
But the money's gone 
He bought books and records 
I don't care about that 
I just want to be alive 
And go to the other... 
I don't want money or books 
Have to decide 
Passive 
And you were shot in the name of it 
And then you'd see yeh, yeh 
Then you'd see 
The relationship 
And walking I see you in the clouds 
And I fall for 
I would fall for you 
I would... 
Forever 
Goodbye, bye 
Goodbye 
And that is all 
STOP STOP
