[Thurston]
Another can of worms
Another stomach turns
Yeh yr ghetto burns
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

You got a stupid man
You got a Ku Klux Klan
Yr fuckin' battle plan
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

A sieg heil-in' squirt
You're an impotent jerk
Yeh a fascist twerp
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Black robe and swill
I believe Anita Hill
Judge will rot in hell
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Yeah a cross on fire
By a christian liar
A black attack on fire
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Yeah the president sucks
He's a war pig fuck
His shit is out of luck
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Another nazi attack
A skinhead is cracked
My blood is black
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

We're banging pots and pans
To make you understand
We gonna bury you man
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

I'm a human wreck
A redneck in check
I killed the teacher's pet
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
