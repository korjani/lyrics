I just come by to run you over
I just come by to see you quiver
You can come you can slip inside babe
Killer eyes and a burnin heart babe

Don't you know you need no other
I'm the man who loves you mother
Open up your arms to me girl
Let me feel your wild heart beat girl

Sweet lips flowers + cream
Deep in love surrender pink steam
Deep in love you need no other
Deep in love yr lonely lover

Feel your wild heart beat
Lonely lover
Open up to me
Lonely mother

Yr sweet lips on mine
Like flowers + cream
O killer eyes
Surrender pink steam
