[Thurston]
A-back in the days when the battles raged, and we thought it was nothing
A bookstore man meets the CIA, and we know
Throw me a cord and plug it in, get the cradle rocking
Ah, out with the redneck pig old men, and it's go

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
Back in time again

Ah, I can't forget your terrorized face, when you cried for the shameless
Wasted life Ameri-K-K-Kan, and you smile
So why should we run when we cannot hide, and my flag is burning?
We could be wrong but that's allright, we'll rise again

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
It's back in town again

Lookin' away it's another day, and of course we love you
Radical man is the CIA, and we say no
We'll round up the Durham H.C. kids, and the Char Grill Killers
Jesse H. come into our pit, all ages show

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
It's back in time again
