Hey now, whats the news?
I heard you've been seen walkin' blue
I know we're all confused, it's ture
I know you feel the same way

Everything we see is clear/everything we feel

I'm here to let you know
All we need to do is just to just let go
You've heard we're "born to lose", I know
But don't you start to think that's really true
You've got the walkin blues today
But soon we'll stand and let the music play

Everything we dream is clear, everything we
Need

Let's say you and I we find/something hard to hold
Let's keep it in our minds
And let it fill our days
Never slip and find we've let it stray
Now we're in for the long ride
We can let the rest slip aside

Everything we need is clear
Everything we feel is clear
Everything we dream is clear
Everything we see is clear
