[Thurston]
I can never forget you - the way you rock the girls
They move a world and love you - a blast in the underworld
I stick a knife in my head - thinking 'bout your eyes
But now that you been shot dead - I've got a new surprise

I been waitin' for you just to say
He's off to check his mind
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time

Can you forgive the boy who - shot you in the head
Or should you get a gun and - go and get revenge?
A 100% of my love - up to you true star
It's hard to believe you took off - I always thought you'd go far

But I've been around the world a million times
And all you men are slime
It's goin' to my head, goodbye I am dead
Wastewood rockers is time for cryin', hey!
