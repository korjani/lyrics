[Thurston]
She comes into my mind
Twisting thru my nerves
I don't understand
A word she says
She's on my side
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time

She comes into my mind
Twisting thru my nerves
I don't understand
A word she says
She's on my side
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
