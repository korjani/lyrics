So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
Now we're gonna be face-to-face
And we lay right down in my favorite place

Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog

Well, Come on

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
But now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sand

Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog

Well, Come on
