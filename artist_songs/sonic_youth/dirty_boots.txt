[Thurston]
Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

Time to take a ride - time to take it in a midnite eye
And if you wanna go - get on below
Pinking out the day - dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love - it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road - and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on - hi di ho
Pinking out the black - dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue - now it's undone

I got some dirty boots - yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots - baby
Dirty boots

Hey!
