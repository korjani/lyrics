Lights on the stones on backed-up drain 
What lovers list on languid stain 
We've come together to gather star 
Shooting up stones a pallored heart 

Dead or alive 
There's danger 
The dead are alright 
With me 

We're not gonna run away 
We're not gonna leave you stranger 
We turn the light on your lonely home 

Camera on the haunted stones 
Blood-shadow gentle painted scorn 
Now it's dancin' ink across your skin 
Hieroglyphic-lover nature-friend 

The dead are alive 
There's danger 
The dead are alright 
With me 

We're not gonna run away 
We're not gonna leave you stranger 
We turn the light on your lonely home
