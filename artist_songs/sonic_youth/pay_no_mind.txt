Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure

That's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind

Give the finger to the rock 'n' roll singer
As he's dancing upon your paycheck
The sales climb high through the garbage-pail sky
Like a giant dildo crushing the sun

That's why
I pay no mind
Sleep in slime
I just got signed

So get out your lead-pipe pipe dreams
Get out your ten-foot flags
The insects are huge and the poison's all been used
And the drugs won't kill your day job...honey

That's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind

That's why
I pay no mind
