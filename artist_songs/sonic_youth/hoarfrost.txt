I put my feet deep in the tracks that you made 
Walked behind you off into the wood 
'We'll know where when we get there' you said 
And we both knew we would 
High above like a spider 
The colors turning brown 
Freeways passing by us 
I took yr hand and we knelt down 
Wheels paddle wheels paddle movement as we go 
Trees passing trees passing signs along the road 
A view thru the trees to a couple in the snow 
A view thru the trees to a couple standing in 
The snow 
Suddenly the trees were flashing by us 
Clouds reflecting fast across your eyes 
We turned into a frozen medow 
The wind the only sound 
'We'll know where when we get there' you said 
'We'll know where when we get there' you said
