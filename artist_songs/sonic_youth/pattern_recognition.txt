I'm a cool hunter making you my way
Like a brand name you'll replay

You're the one [x4] 

Heat-seeking missile freak 
Black magick 
Scared to speak 
I will know you 
I won't show you, yeah yeah 
Will you buy me a shaky heart 
Let's forget has torn me apart 

I will know you 
I won't show you, yeah yeah

Yesterday's girl 
Cuz everyday I feel more like her 
Oh baby baby 
Please don't go 

Pattern recognition 
Is kind of slow 
Like a cool hunter watch the disarray 
Keep your secret foolish head away 
I will know you 
I won't show you, yeah yeah 
Close your eyes and feel the fun 
Pattern recognition's on the run 

I will know you 
I won't show you, yeah yeah yeah 
You're the one [x4]
