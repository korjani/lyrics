Can't get no rest
Don't know how I work all day
When will I learn?
Memories get in the way

I walk around
I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud, but I
Don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone 

Well, I spent all the day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there

I guess I'll find
The love, peace of mind, some other time, but I
Still have today
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

12:45
Headed for the subway home
I took my time
'Cause I felt so all alone

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smilin' as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go
We'll take it slow
I guess I'll call it a day

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feeling blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smiling as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go

I guess I'll call it a day

What they should do

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

Keeps me feeling blue

Been down too long
