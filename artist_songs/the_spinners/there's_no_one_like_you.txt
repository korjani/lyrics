I don't mind
Steering up a cloudy day
When love is on it's way

Now I have
Dreams of you and yesterday
And how we're going to stay
In love

Like clinging vines
We'll stand in stormy weather
I see the sun
We'll always be together
I just can't help this feeling
Your love just keeps me willing
To climb the highest mountain for you

There's no one like you
No baby, no girl
There's no one like you
You the sun in my tomorrow
There's no one like you
Whow, yeah yeah

I don't mind
Riding on a shooting star
The dream is not too far

If by chance
You should fall and need someone
You know just where to come
For love

And when we reach
The other side of heaven
We'll build a home
For maybe six or seven
The only song I'm singing
It's love that keeps me ringing
In my heart
There's no one like you

There's no one like you
No baby, no girl
Say you brighten my world
There's no one like you
Ain't nobody like you, baby no no
There's no one like you
Whow, whow whow whow
Yeah

And we reach
The other side of heaven
We'll build a home
For maybe six or seven
The only song I'm singing
Love, love that keeps on ringing
In my heart
Ain't nobody but you
Ain't nobody but you

There's no one like you
Can't love nobody else, no no no no
There's no one like you
No baby, no girl
There's no one like you
I've been trying for a long long time, hey baby
There's no one like you
Just can't get you off my mind
There's no one like you
I wanna build a home for you, well well well
There's no one like you
Do all the things that we'd say we'd do
There's no one like you
You like the flowers in the spring
Such a pretty little thing
