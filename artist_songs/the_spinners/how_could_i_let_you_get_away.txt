Like Howdy Do
Your tin soldiers your clowns too
They’re all laughing at you, 
I’m laughing at you too
Like basket ball, five fouls and that was all
The games you really knew yeah, why could I beat you
In the middle of the room got no time to 
Count may sheep today

How could I let get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon
How could I let you get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon

Like mother goose
Winds you up the turns your lose
Block 10 was beatin’ two
And I can’t tell green from blue no no
Like cat and mouse games of chase instead of house
I’d get so mad at you
Like parents often do
In the middle of the room
Got not time to 
Count my sheep today baby

How could let you get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon
Oooh hooo (how could I lets you get away) baby
When I knew I need somebody soon

Oooh baby (how could I let you get away) how could let you get away baby
When I knew I need somebody soon yeah
Hey baby I didn’t count my sheep I let my woman weep baby
I knew down inside I needed someone soon
Like Mother Goose I done let you lose
And I need you baby yeah
Ooh wee I need somebody soon
Help me now to keep my feet on the ground
