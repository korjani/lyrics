I put my faith 
In the absence of something better 
If it doesn't fit then its out of reach for me 
I'm a tightly wound mess 
Neatly perched inside my own distress 
And you talk of freedom 
That means nothing to me 
And then you say 

How we ever gonna know if there's something better 
Is the only way to know ourselves to go too far 

I spend my days in a fear
One day a wind will blow me away 
The only thing that keeps me here 
Are these strings of mine that hold me down 
I watch the rise and fall of a thousand days
It means nothing to me 
Cause I've been promised redemption 
For a life time wasted in these golden fields 

So far so good so many promises 
Swinging in the wind directions something that I can't control 
Creation eludes me its all just waiting time here in this field 
Nothing but a scarecrow waiting for the world to tear me down

How we ever gonna know 
If there's something better 
How are we gonna come to be the same 
If we come to fair to realize
How we ever gonna become 
Something better then what we've become
Or are we just scarecrows just waiting?
Or are we just...
