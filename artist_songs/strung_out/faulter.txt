Do you believe there's hope for your kind, 
that your insatiable quest for direction will one day 
help you find veracity and meaning to your existence as a whole, 
that all your dreams of happy endings 
will be achieved with faith and sometimes 
do you feel that cold wind blowin you beyond all you think is right--
beyond all realm of human thought, 
beyond your foolish thinking, 
one step ahead is one inch closer to the end
