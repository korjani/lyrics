The wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine, 
Another message lost into the void of time,
Is anybody out there get the message that I send?
Would anybody read it then send it back again?
A call to mend connection lost through memory and bone,
A call to find a new way to communicate and grow!
I sold my voice to pay for my security 
Now I write my sentence on its walls

I'm calling, is anybody else out there?
Is anybody tunning in?

One thousand years that I've waited for a sign 
A dream may last just seconds changing you for all times 
Frantic incoherent just a reach in the dark!
A message for my lonely thoughts a sparrow for my heart.

I'm calling, is anybody else out there? 
Is anybody listening? Can anybody hear me?

The wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine

I'm calling, is anybody else out there? 
Is anybody listening? Can anybody save me?

The wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine,
Another message lost straight from this heart of mine
A message out to anybody tunning in 
That this whole world is slowly caving in!
