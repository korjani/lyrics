I never had all the answers
I never had enough time
But I sure had all the reasons
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

I never laid all my cards out
You just wanted to play
The king he waited on my doorsteps
While the joker and me went on our way

[Chorus]
Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

These days everything is all business
Never in one place for too long
But there's no lack of arms around me
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong

[Chorus]

In Tennessee

And I'd wish on every star in the
Southern sky
For that man and our life
If I did not think that

[Chorus]

Yes, I guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tenneesee
