You never give up
I can't believe anything you say
And it must be my luck
'Cause no one else gets treated this way

And I wanna know
What goes on in that head of yours
Yeah, I wanna know
'Cause I don't think I can take much more

Rain
You must be sick or something
I can't take another day
Rain
Is falling down
But will the sun come out again?

I never speak up
I just try and stay out of the way
But I must have messed up
'Cause that's all I hear you say

And I wanna know
What on earth makes you act like this
Yeah, I wanna know
'Cause I don't think I can take this shit

Sun come out
