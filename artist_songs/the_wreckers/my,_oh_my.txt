This concrete road used to just be dirt
We'd drive out here after work
Every Friday night when I was eighteen

This parking lot used to be a field
I parked here in my Oldsmobile
Long before the Sonic and the Walgreens

[Chorus]
Not no more
Not no more
My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes
In the blink of an eye
My, oh my
Look how the years have flown
Turning around before you know it
Up and gone
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Times have changed and so have I
I once was young and starry-eyed
Now I have these bittersweet memories

Songs were long and gas was cheap
No cell phones and water was free
Daddy paid and I never had to worry

[Chorus]

Oh my, oh my, my, my

[Chorus]

Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
