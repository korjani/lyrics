Somewhere in the country
There's a place
Where nobody knows your name

When I'm feeling lonely there's a train
That helps me run away

[Chorus]
I know my mother She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home

Somewhere in the city
There's a face
That makes it hard to stay

He never listened to me
When I'd say
That things would never change

[Chorus]

The way back home
The way back home

[Chorus]

I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home
