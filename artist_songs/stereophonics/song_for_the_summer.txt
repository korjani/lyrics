Open my eyes
Today's a new day
Tell myself take my time
Put the brakes on my brain

Wrap me up
Spin me round
Spit me out
I can feel either way

So maybe you're down in the gutter
Or high in the clouds it don't matter

Song for the summer
Song for the rain
Get a little closer to see clear again
Song for tomorrow
Song for today
Come a little closer
To feel right again

All this while
Which road should I follow?
Sit yourself down
Come right tomorrow

Wrap me up
Spin me round
Spit me out
It's always the same

So maybe you're down in the gutter
Or high in the clouds it don't matter

Song for the summer
Song for the rain
Get a little closer to see clear again
Song for tomorrow
Song for today
Come a little closer
To feel right again

Song for the summer
Song for the rain
Get a little closer to see clear again
Song for tomorrow
Song for today
Come a little closer
To feel right again

Song for the summer
Song for the rain
Get a little closer to see clear again
Song for tomorrow
Song for today
Come a little closer
To feel right again, to feel right again
