I don't know why I let you go
You said you'd wait I said I'd hope you would
We talked 'til late until we walked away
What's meant to be will be the same

And I feel like stone
Yes I feel ice cold
I pick myself up from the ground
Sick to death of lying down
And now I have to find you once again

You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now
You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now

Driving round and round until its dawn
To look for you in rooms we used to go
I held you back, I had to set you free
But now I know what's meant to be

And I feel like stone
Yes I feel ice cold
I pick myself up from the ground
Sick to death of lying down
And now I have to find you once again

You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now
You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now

You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now
You're in my soul
You're in my mind
But I don't know where you are now
