the same long faces in the workman's hall caramel crisp counts 
his birds cliff chip's lines up his dominoes kingfisher lead singer 
calms his nerves 
I'm drinking sinking swimming drowning working smirking learning 
burning sleeping thieving cheating beating I'm eating I'm deep in a 
goldfish bowl It's sink or swim 
the hall down town just burns to the ground my boxing ring turned to ash 
red head ginger bread sells tickets at the door stella sleep walks in the sand 
I'm drinking sinking swimming drowning working smirking learning burning 
sleeping thieving cheating beating I'm eating I'm deep in a goldfish bowl It's sink 
or swim they're looking in 
hard up outta luck time to ride the village bike a bike been used ten times or 
more grape vine here's the wife lays down her royal flush 
I think I've lost another wife
