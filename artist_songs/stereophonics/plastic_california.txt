Plastic California,
Looks like Blackpool,
Outta date.
Some love, some hate.

It's all your competition,
It's not my occupation, true.
But it's what you do.

Some love, some hate.
Some love, some hate.

I like pink architecture,
Flip back my red strip deck chair, prove.
We got nothing to prove.

Gin stroke amnesia problems,
Over hearing talk of Hollywood,
We wish we could, ya should.

Some love and some hate.
Some love and some hate.

It's a beautiful place for nature,
And all the beautiful people make it true.
But you look as good as you.

Some love and some hate.
Some love and some hate.

Makes me feel great.
Makes me feel great.
I feel new,
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
Ha, ha!
Well I'm pleased to meet you!
