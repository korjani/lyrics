From day one
When we first breathe
Into the light
We first see

Searching our souls
Ever since our mothers
Brought us this life
So what's to be

Into this world
Into the sun
To find the love
That makes you one

Climbed a mountain
So I can see
All of the wonder
In front of me

To watch the sunrise
To feel the breeze
Mothers and children
Their destiny

Into the world
Into the sea
To find the love
That makes you free

Into the lies
Into the grace
Into the love
Into the hate
Into the world

Into the wild
Into the hurt
Into the loss
Into the birth

You're that I want
You're all that I see
You're all that I got
You're next to me

To find the love that makes you free
To hear the words
You sang to me

Into the world
Into the rain
Into the storm
And back again

You're that I want
You're all that I see
In everything
Right next to me

So open your heart
And open your eyes
Open your arms
Into this life
Into the world
