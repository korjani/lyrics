We wait to wake to get a ride in the rain
Buy a ticket they can check we can claim
So we don't spend what's our own
For a seat a place to stop a green light
A red cross they run around naked
Doing old things like the ones before

Wait for a break so you can take a little
Something that'll make your next break
Come along a little quicker than the one before
Wait for an answer spy a sweet dancer
As she walks from the door of the hall
Wish you waited for your wedding vows

So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?

We wait to get warm the car starts
From cold stall to make the first move
Magazines made the rules to make us lose
For your dream man the house you could both plan
The car in the sales add the wet dream
With the man you wish that you had

So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?

A watched pot never boils sugar
Seconds to dissolve see your appetite
Lost foods relevance is lost inside

We wait to get there and when we get there
We wait around for anyone to
Tell us what we even got there for

So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
What's worth waiting for?
What's worth waiting for?
What's worth waiting for?
What's worth waiting for?

So join the queue me and you
Wait in line it takes our time
To be satisfied
