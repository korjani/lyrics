Calling over to seize my hunger
To see you to feel you
To be with need you

We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky

[Chorus:]
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday

White lights blinding
Headlights driving
To see you to feel you
To be with need you

We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky

[Chorus]

When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright

Live in the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time has just begun (time has just begun has just begun)
Swim in the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time to run will come

[Chorus]

When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright

Yeah we share the same sun everyday
