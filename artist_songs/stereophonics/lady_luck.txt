We're falling now, can't make it stop
Our arms are open for the thing we want
But what we want just can't have
What could've been but the timing's bad
Don't cry cry baby now
You're my my Lady Luck

We follow the signs to make us meet
Into the night, to places no-one sees
I never learned from looking back
You picked me up from off my back
But now it seems our time has passed

Don't cry cry baby now
You're my my Lady Luck
You picked me up right off my back
I'd fallen down you brought me up
We shared the night until the morning comes to take us
Back away to where, we chose to belong
But maybe we're wrong but we gotta be strong
There's too much to loose
And maybe we're fools, who knows
Who knows, who knows

We follow the signs to make us meet
Into the night, to places no-one sees
