There's things I want,
There's things I think I want
There's things I've had,
There's things I wanna have
Do I want the dreams?
The ones we're forced to see

Do I want the perfect wife?
But perfect ain't quite right
Shopping every day,
Take it back the next break
They say the more you fly,
The more you risk
Your life

I'm just looking,
I'm not buying
I'm just looking,
It keeps me smiling

A house I've seen,
Another coulda been
You drenched my head
And said what I said
You said that life is what
You make of it
Yet most of us just fake

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
It keeps me smiling

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Well I'm just looking
It keeps me trying

And I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Well I'm just looking
It keeps me smiling

There's things I want,
There's things I think I want
There's things I've had,
There's things I wanna have.
They say the more you fly,
The more you risk
Your whole life

I'm just looking,
I'm not buying
I'm just looking,
It keeps me smiling
