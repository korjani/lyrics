Woke up with the shakes on the bathroom floor
The sun is shining, I felt like drinking some more
Sunday's takeaway welded on my elvis tray
It's a pound a can in the garden all day

Start at noon, keep on going through til two
Dabbing speed like a monkey in a fucking zoo
Get your girl in the bathroom, after flirting all day
It's the time of your life on Bank Holiday Monday

Street Fighting
Yet some day
You get out

Out of those mondays
Yes some say
They were the best days
Out of our minds
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

8 O'clock time to catch the next bus to town
When the drink is in, the wit is most definitely out
Late bars, fight starts, between my brother and I
Get kicked out so we hold tight and take it outside

Dodging cars, new scars, fighting out on the road
Knees me in the chest my head and arse hits the floor
Swallowed tongue, what we done, someone's hand in my mouth
Got to pull it back out on a Bank Holiday Monday

Street Fighting
Yet some day
You get out

Out of those mondays
Yes some say
They were the best days
Out of our minds
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

I want to stick him real hard with a kitchen knife
But we share the same bed in my mam's house tonight
I wait, I wait, I wait, until he walks up the lane
It's all the fun of the fair on Bank Holiday Monday

Street Fighting
Yet some day
You get out

Out of those mondays
Yes some say
They were the best days
Out of our minds
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
