If I could
You know I would
I'd give up and be free
Every time I take a drink
I sink into the sea

It's ok
We've got days to be
Oooh no one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see

Let you down a thousand times
In rationality
All I've done I've blamed no one
All roads lead back to me

It's ok
We've got days to be
Ooooh no one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see
You've made a better man of me
You've made a better man of me

Nothing
Lasts forever
Tomorrow
You will see

If I could
You know I would
I'd give up and be free

Ooooh
No one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see
You've made a better man of me
You've made a better man of me
