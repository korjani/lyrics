Long as I remember 
The rain been coming down 
Clouds of mystery falling 
Confusion on the ground 
Good men through the ages 
Trying to find a sun 
And I wonder, still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain 
I went down Virginia 
Seeking shelter from the storm 
Caught up in the fable 
I watched the tower grow 
About your plans for new year 
Wrapped in golden chains 
And I wonder still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain 
Heard the singers playing 
How I cheered for more 
The crowd had rushed together 
Trying to keep warm 
And still the rain kept falling 
falling on my head 
And I wonder still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain
