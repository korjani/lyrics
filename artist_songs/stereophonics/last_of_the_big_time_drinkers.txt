Ten minutes flat after that day at the factory
I'm Drinking like a dog in the sun
I don't need to eat or sleep a wink, at the weekend
Drop my guts

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers

The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on my glass
I don't live to work, I work to live, I live at the weekend
I nearly spent a week in the sun
Come home with my bird, sheets thrown out the window
And sunday morning comes

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers

The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on my glass

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers

Just give me half a pint of slops
Last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my job
Last of the big time drinkers
