I don't know why
I don't know what is wrong
Oh no
Is karma gonna get me?
At times that's all I see
It's not real

Wanna feel
Wanna feel, like I did before

Mornings I can't breathe
Wave crashes over me
And drowns me
Wind's running rings around me
It takes me time to see
What is real?

Wanna feel
Wanna feel
Like I did before
Like I did before

Time changes things
Like I never thought
Like I never saw?

Time changes me
I'm like I never was
Oh no

I'm looling back to what I was
I've seen my face right on the floor
And I love you, being around
I say it again, I'm not fucking around

I've seen in before
I'll see ut again
It's knocking my door
And it never pretends
I'm down on my knees
And I don't know where to go to find my way back home

I'm drowning
I'm drowning
I'm drowning
I'm drowning
