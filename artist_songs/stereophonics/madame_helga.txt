Mary Mary where you been
You've been out all night
You ain't got no sleep

I've been dancing in the hills
At a place I know
She said 'and that's the place
Where the fire flies glow'

Had to slap my white face
Pull my head from the clouds

And I kept
Buying and, lying and flying, relying and dying
To know what spins her world around

Good morning I missed ya
But ya bring me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line

It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly
Is where I spent last night

She's been married not once
Not twice, but three
And that's the livin' lovin' woman
I want me to be

There were pictures and paintings
Of freaks like me
So I drank with my devil
For my company

Had to slap my white face
Pull my head from my clouds

And I kept
Buying and, lying and flying, relying and dying
To know what spins her world around

Good morning I missed ya
But ya bringing me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line

It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly 
Is where I spent last night

Good morning I missed ya
But ya bringing me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line

It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly 
Is where I spent last night
