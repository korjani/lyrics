Oh can you feel it?
There's no money in this town
Oh can you see it?
There's people dyin' all around

I'm in trouble
You're in trouble
Deep deep trouble
Someone burst our bubble
I'm in trouble
Won't ya save our souls tonight

Oh work to borrow
'Cause we can't buy with what we got
Oh no-one to follow
No one's saying such a lot

I'm in trouble
You're in trouble
Deep deep trouble
Someone burst our bubble
I'm in trouble
Won't ya save our souls tonight

Oh nowhere to run to
There's fighting everywhere we go
Oh getting brainwashed
What do you believe in any more?

Oh can you feel it?
There's no money in this town

I'm in trouble
You're in trouble
Deep deep trouble
Someone burst our bubble
I'm in trouble
Won't ya save our souls tonight
