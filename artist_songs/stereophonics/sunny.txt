Left late in the rain from the city
She lived by the sea
Stepped onto the train at the station
To where we said we'd meet
A slow bar with a gin and a jukebox
Where she likes to go
The rain stops every time that I see her
Every time for sure
All right now
All right now

Sunny, you're so sunny
With no money, it's so funny
Who needs a money, it's so sunny
And you feel like summer

Sunny, you're so sunny
With no money, it's so funny
Who needs a money
When it's so sunny
You just feel like summer

I don't know where you came from
I don't know what's going on
The morning I could be long gone
If you feel like it

Right or wrong it feels so good
And you just don't know if you could
And everyone's misunderstood
And feel like summer nights
Summer nights
