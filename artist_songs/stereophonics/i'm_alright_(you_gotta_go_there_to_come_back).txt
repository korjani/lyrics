I'll drink another drink for you
One, two, three, four, five, once I drank a fish alive
I'll drop another pill for you
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, did it before, I'll do it again

I'll tell another joke for you
Did you hear the one about the one that looks like you
I'll sleep with sleep arounds for you
Why don't you scratch my back and chew the tongue I chew

I'm alright
I'm alright

I'll tell another lie for you
Tell you what you wanna hear, but that don't make it true
I'll wear another smile for you
That way you know I'm fine, and having fun with you

I'll draw another line for you
That way you know I'm hip, that way you know I'm cool
I'll smoke another smoke for you
I'll blow back in your mouth and you can blow back too

I'm alright
I'm alright
You gotta go there to come back

I'll take another punch for you
Tie my hands behind my back, that way you cannot lose
I'll make another pound for you
So you can drive your motor car, and drive you to the moon

I'm alright
I'm alright

You. Me. Us. Free... we're alright, alright

Love. Pain. Hate. Rain... we're alright, alright

Give. Take. Time. Place... we're alright, alright
