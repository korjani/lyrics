I watched the water rise in our house
the rain poured in and washed out our stuff
my father drank from beer bottles
then he'd say
we'll walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down

all that we had was deep in the mud
our photographs and family treasures
my mother drank from beer bottles
then she'd say
we'll walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down

don't let it bring you down (and let your head drop down)
don't let the sun go down (and let your light go out)
don't let yourself fall down
just pick yourself up from the street and get up on your feet

walk on, walk on, what's done, is done
walk on, my son, never let this world drag you down
never let this world drag you down
