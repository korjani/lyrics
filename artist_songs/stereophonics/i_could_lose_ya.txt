Oocha
Click click then you hang the phone up
After talking late into the daylight
Telling stories how we'd like to do it
The mind can be a playground if you use it
She could go down on me in a theatre
I'd stroke her head, look round over my shoulder
We'd get kicked out we'd walk along the pier
I'd try to get my hand under her jumper

Yes I could lose ya
If I choose to
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes I could lose ya
If I choose to
Why would I wanna do that?

Drip drip the rain upon my window
Wanna lay down still and just be near you
Get the keys and take the Karmann Ghia
Along the coast to buy a couple of beers
She could dance and look across the water
Dream of ways to run away together
The sun sets and glows across the ocean
Shooting star reminds us that it feels good

Yes I could lose ya
If I choose to
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes I could lose ya
If I choose to
Why would I wanna do that?
