salt grips the road awaits his lift again street orange glow shades the odds against one 
more sip a shoe a miss a shaving nick one extra kiss who's to know whatever! not up 
to me not up to you swings don't swing the parks been dead for years how do you 
know the last swing weren't your last for good hard book on freaks fresh summer 
peach creased magazine sugar chocolate treat who's to know whatever! not up 
to me not up to you the street's so long where she lost her pocket purse kept the last 
picture of the man she committed first cracked windscreen rain french murder play 
junk take away tired street parades who's to know whatever! whatever! not up to me 
not up to you 
not up to anything we do
