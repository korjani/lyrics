You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

You look like Jesus on a aeroplane
Ya head's against the window pane
You got opinions but you ain't got news
You got good laughs but when it suits you
You turn it on like a leaking tap
And dripping dropping people drop of a hat
You gotta mouth but you ain't got guts
That drunken mouth you should keep it shut

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

Superman on a aeroplane
Sitting next to Lois Lane
You gotta that woman but you want her gone
So you can sleep with a teenage blonde
You wear a mask wear an armoured suit
Can't get to you with the gun I shoot
You play your cards close to your chest because ya
Poker face is a dreadry mess

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like you
Meeting someone like ah ah ah aah
Ooh

Superman on a aeroplane
Sitting next to Lois Lane
You gotta that woman but you want her gone
So you can fuck a teenage blonde
You turn it on like a leaking tap
And dripping dropping people drop of a hat
You gotta mouth but you ain't got guts
That drunken mouth you should keep it shut
