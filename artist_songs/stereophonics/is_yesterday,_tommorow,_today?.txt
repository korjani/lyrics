It's another way, to get through the day,
Picking up ripped cigarette boxes hoping that one remains
Yellow lucky day, suck deep and bathe,
For the next ten minutes spent coughing all the pleasures craved

Write down all the things that you'd like to say,
Write down all the things that you'd like to change,
Write down all the places you'd like to stay,
Write down anything that you want

Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?
Is nothing gonna change the way?

Cracked rock top wall, left the ash to fall, left alone to wait,
I've never looked at things I've liked only things I hate
You're not the first today, not the softest face,
Was there any that you liked? was there any that you didn't fake?

Write down all the things that you'd like to be,
Write down all the things that you don't believe,
Write down all the places you'd like to see,
Write down anything that you want

Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?
Is nothing gonna change the way?

Because, everything that's you,
And the things that you like to do,
And all of the things that are,
Come back again, come back again,
Come back again, come back again,
Come back again,

Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?
