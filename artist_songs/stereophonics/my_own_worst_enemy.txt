I’d just turned twenty six and she was twenty three 
She wore a crucifix but never preached at me 
We’d stay up all the night until the day was dead 
I’d get the fear of God inside my broken head 

Wanna fly away 
And change my ways 

I’ll beat myself to death while she sits next to me 
I wanna free myself from all this misery 
I wanna taste the love but life’s against up me 
But I am my own worst enemy 

I try to get some sleep her arms are over me 
I’m staring at the walls they're closing in on me 
This sun bleeds through the blinds that washes over me 
Today’s the day I tell myself to set me free 

Wanna fly away 
And change my ways 

I’ll beat myself to death while she sits next to me 
I wanna free myself from all this misery 
I wanna taste the love but life’s against up me 
But I am my own worst enemy 

(Feel .. Wanna feel it .. wanna feel it .. wanna feel it ...) 

I wanna fly away 
And change my ways 

I’ll beat myself to death while she sits next to me 
I wanna free myself from all this misery 
I wanna taste the love but life’s against up me 
But I am my own worst enemy 

.. Worst enemy 
.. Worst enemy 
.. Worst enemy!
