I'd like to know what it's all about?
What's out there?
Am I gonna get old and laugh?
About something
Will I get me a boy or a girl?
Or not either?
Will I get what I want from this world?
I'm a day dreamer

Then I watch the old couple dance
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you 'round

I'd like to know what you're all about?
What's up there?
Are you gonna get old and laugh?
Without a care
Will you get you a boy or a girl
Or not either?
Will you get what you want from this world?
A day dreamer?

Then I watch the old couple dance
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you 'round

I'd love to know what we're all about
We all have done
Am I gonna get old and laugh?
With someone?
Think I'll get me a boy and a girl
Or not either?
Will I get what I want from this world?
I'm a daydreamer

Then I watch the old couple dance
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you 'round
