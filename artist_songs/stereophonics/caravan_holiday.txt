Seven day holiday in the rain, it's June
At the time we were plain old me and you
It didn't matter that the sky came down
I never really felt like going out
Seven days watching rain inside with you 

Saturday watched the game you fried our food
Nothing busy nothing easy but something you
It didn't matter that we couldn't eat out
My ship sank and my shoes were damp
Seven days hearing rain inside with you 

There's always time to complain about the weather
Seasons change in a day just like each other
But we wait for summer
Seven day holiday in the rain with you

Lie awake drinking late is all that's left to do
Not a sound but the rain on the pale blue roof
It didn't matter that we couldn't sleep out
I never really felt like sleeping rough
Seven day holiday drinking dry with you 

There's always time to complain about the weather
Seasons change in a day just like each other
But we wait for summer
Seven day holiday in the rain with you
Seven day holiday in the rain with you
