I got a royal flush
I gotta ten bob
In my pocket for luck
Just another crush
I got my head read
In the shed once again
My friend

Inside, outside, upside, downside
See my face wanna take me home
I missed your sister, shake your pistol
Hear my voice on your telephone

Just another lush
I got my ten green bottles
In my pocket for luck

In another rut
Get your deadhead
In the shed once again
My friend

Inside, outside, upside, downside
See my face wanna take me home
I missed your sister, shake your pistol
Hear my voice on your telephone

Cigarette burning, got an opal ring
Dirty magazine turning, you're a bird who sings
Sleeping on a shag pile, sleeping on me
Sleeping like an angel watching over me
