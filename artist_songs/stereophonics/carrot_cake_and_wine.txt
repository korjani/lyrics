I'm looking good Got my shoulders back
A few more drinks I'm up to dance
I get the eye as I lift my glass
The first time in six months
She looks again I start to shake
My shoulders twitching
I'm on my way
I glance behind me for safety sake
to see a clock the size of a plane
The night is young more fish in the sea
Who's to say she wasn't looking at me
I sink my head back in to my glass
Get in to shape for that first dance
I turn away I look to the south
I pull my foot from out of my mouth
To my surprise she's standing beside me
Asking if I'd like to dance
I'm standing in a hall of smoke
Her tongues in my mouth
I'd love to choke
Her knight approaches us on foot
Left his side kick at the brook
He offered me a cigarette
I said I'm far to young to smoke
So he tried to entertain me
Told me one more crappy joke
In my ear except the joke wasn't clear
Set the joking aside
Should I run, should I hide
I've decided to stay, rub it in his face
What I thought was the case
Was an easy mistake
I just like to try some carrot cake and wine
Can't I try taste my carrot cake and wine
Looking good not looking back
Knight of hers took her off to dance
I get the eye but not for the last time
She looks again I start to shake
My legs are twitching my eyes are fake
I glance behind me for safety's sake
To see my girlfriend's tongue in the
Face of a friend who is far from a man
Should I hide should I run
Must have see what I've done
Decided to stay liked the look on her face
What I thought was the case
Was an easy mistake
I'd just like to try some carrot cake and wine
Can't I try taste my carrot cake
Why cant I try? Why should I lie?
Taste my try some of my
Carrot cake and wine
