Sandy was from out of town
And I met her at the beach
She drove a white Mondeo ride
Which I thought was kinda cheap

She danced a while and drank some wine
Before she rolled her eyes at me
I picked them up and I rolled them back
And then we swam into the sea

She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me

We talked all night into the morning light
Until it was time to find some food
We drank coffee until it made me shake
And I rolled into a beer

She got drunk and loud and laughed
And then it all turned into tears
And then she got into a bar-room brawl
So I said "It's okay, she's with me"

She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
She's Okay, She's with me

Oooooh [x4]

They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"

She's Alright [x5]
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright [x5]
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
