I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
I'm gonna sleep down by his quarters 
I'd like to have sex with his daughters 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm just another great truck driver 
He's just another white house skiver 
Get a gun ready your aircraft 
Big man got ready to broadcast 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on a war zone 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm gonna have to shoot my way out 
To give the access boys some more clout 
I was Butch Cassidy's tutor 
Although sun dance was cuter 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me 

Gonna buy myself a small plane 
Gonna crash it on the south line 
Gonna buy myself a small plane 
Gonna crash it on a war zone 
Gonna buy myself a small plane 
Gonna crash it on your brow 
Yeah its big enough for me 
For me, for me, for me 
For me, for me, for me
