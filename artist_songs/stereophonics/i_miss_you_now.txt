I feel I wanna hold you, wanna tell you that you'll be alright
Sang this song today, it's recalling your pictures all in my mind
I miss you now
I miss you now 
Although we're getting old now my old friends gonna leave me and die
I'm helpless, it's gonna get us before we get this, I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
I miss you now
I miss you now 

I feel I wanna hold you, wanna tell you that you'll be alright
I'm helpless, it's gonna get us before we get this, I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
I miss you now
I miss you now
