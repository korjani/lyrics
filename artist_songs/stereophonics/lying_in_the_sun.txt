Wish I could lie in the sun
The same things as anyone
Wish I could lie down there
With my feet, high in the air

I'd have a drink in my hand
Read words from a newspaper stand
Wish I could lie in the sun
Wish I could fly like everyone

Same things as anyone
Same things as anyone

But you burn me up you paint my skin
In bad designs that ain't even in

My skin's crawling up the wall
Into the ocean I'd love to fall
I hear the sounds but they ain't the same
As feeling them with you two feet away

There's always more worse off than me
Suppose I'm lucky I can even see
All the people that I'd like to be
Passing me by everyday in the street
Same things as anyone
Same things as anyone

But you burn me up you paint my skin
In bad designs that ain't even in
I got good lungs, got a good heart
My mind is fit, and my feet can walk

And here I am in the shade on the street
Asking people for money to eat
What did I ever do to deserve this?
Did I kill a child or something worse?

Same things as anyone

What's the reason maybe make you feel 
How much more fortunate you are than me
