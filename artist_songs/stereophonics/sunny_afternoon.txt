The tax man's taken all my dough 
And left me in my stately home 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon 
I can't even sail my yacht 
He's taken everything I've got 
All I've got's this sunny afternoon 

Oh save me, save me, save me from this squeeze 
I gotta big fat mama trying to break me 
And I love to live so pleasantly 
Live this life of luxury 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 

My girlfriend's run off with my car 
And gone back to her ma and pa 
Telling tails of drunkenness and cruelty 
Now I'm sitting here 
Sipping at my ice cold beer 
All I've got's this sunny afternoon 

Help me, help me, help me sail away 
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay 
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly 
Live this life of luxury 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 

Ah save me save me save me from this squeeze 
I gotta big fat mama trying to break me 
And I love to live so pleasantly 
Live this life of luxury 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 
In the summertime
