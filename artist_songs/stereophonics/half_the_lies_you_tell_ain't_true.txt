You could lick or chew,
Tongue in style tonight,
Champagne drag queen suit,
Pinstripe outta line, it's time to try how,
Blisters on your feet,
Blisters up your spine,
If I could choose from two
I'd mime to be a smile, ha ha ha ha

But when you rely on a lie that's true,
And no one believes in the things you do
'Cause half the lies you tell ain't true
I'm gonna find out, I'm gonna find a piece of you

You could pick and lose,
Diesel dreams for crime,
I should win and choose,
Colours undersize,
A naked fake that's a
Face that fits for two,
Sex brings out the spies,
Hanging from your feet,
Hollywood star style, ha ha ha ha

But when you rely on a lie that's true,
And no one believes in the things you do
'Cause half the lies you tell ain't true
I'm gonna find out, I'm gonna find a piece of you

But when you rely on a lie that's true,
And no one believes in the things you do,
Cause half the lies you tell ain't true,
I'm gonna find a piece of you
But when you rely on a lie that's true,
No one believes in the things you do
Cause half the lies you tell ain't true,
I'm gonna find a, I'm gonna find a, I'm gonna find a piece of you
