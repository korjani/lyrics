She slept on an iron bed lived through the war for what? 
Butterflies round the fire smiled 
Smiled until she's robbed of all she's got 

I heard the innocent got shot today 
Grandma died on poppy day 
I heard the dress downed got turned away 
All died, died on poppy day 

Fancy dress in a dress down town 
Happy halloween 
Door breaks open lost and walked in 
Killing the happy scene 

I heard the innocent got shot today 
Grandma died on poppy day 
I heard the dress downed got turned away 
Old dad died on poppy day 

I heard the innocent got shot today 
Grandma died on poppy day 
I heard the dress downed got turned away 
Old dad died on poppy day 
On poppy day
