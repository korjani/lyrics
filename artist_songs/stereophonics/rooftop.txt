Standing on a rooftop
Trying to clear my mind
I only came up to look
But now there's such a crowd 

I don't feel that bad
Can't help but laugh
And they cry out
They say jump and I say how high? 

I feel my body blowing
From every side to side
My mind can't help but knowing...
What it feels like to fly

I don't feel that bad
Can't help but laugh
But they cry out
They say jump and I say how high?
They say jump and I say I might

And they cry out
And they cry out

Say jump and I say I might
Say jump and I say I'll try
Say jump and I say I'll say goodbye
Say jump and I say how high 

High, High, Fly, Fly 

I'm just standing on the edge of
Something I should try to hide from
I don't know much but I know something
I need to try and find me a way 
Try I always come out fighting
I don't feel I should deny me
Can't help knowing what is down there
Feels like I should fly now for them 

I'm fascinated, mis-educated, It's reincarnation
Of my imagination
I'm far away, from here today
It's where I'll stay if I get my way
It's lying awake, that makes me sane
But it makes me sick but I can't change again
