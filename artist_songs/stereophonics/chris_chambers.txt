It sickens me to see the photograph in front of me 
Carnation couloured pink stand aside and take a drink 
Night club another scene 31st its halloween 
Slave to each new trend up town junkies push again 
The lovers and the wannabe's they don't know how 
The radio's and the tv they don't know how 
The newspaper story reads they don't know how 
Cheap girl magazine they don't know how 
Stand aside and cry never wonder why 
Ask themselves why the river has dried 
Laughter after three shaped up to be free 
Number one the most missed chart 
Must have broke a thousand hearts 
Parallel with the scene tarnished star evergreen 
Lived life disguised 
The lovers and the wannabe's they don't know how 
The radio's and the tv they don't know how 
The newspaper story reads they don't know how 
Cheap girl magazine they don't know how 
Stand around and cry and never wonder why 
Ask themselves why the river has dried 
Hoo hoo hoo hoo 
Hoo hoo hoo hoo 
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
