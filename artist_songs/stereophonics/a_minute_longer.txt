They're calling out
Come on lets go
But I'm miles away
To a year before
Laughs from a glass
Drank to the past
On the old green seat
Like velvet to the hand

Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer?

Last one for some
Sick from the rum
I played golf on the carpet with someone

Crash back to date
Few things I hate
But I'd rather us live
In the present day

Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer?
If you'd like I'd stay for a minute longer
As longer
As longer
Longer
