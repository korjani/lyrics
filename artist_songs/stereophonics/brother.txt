Won't you take your words brother?
Won't you mind your world brother?
I find you so offensive punk
Won't you take my word brother?
I tell you no lies now leave me brother
You disturb me turn me hurt me sister

You walk right up to me
Abuse me on the street
Like a cannonball killing me
You got it wrong brother can't you see?

Won't you walk on home brother?
Won't you live and learn brother?

Are you a loser? No one to choose ya? Accuser?
