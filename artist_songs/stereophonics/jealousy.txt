Jealousy my devil
Jealousy my hell
Jealousy insomnia
Jealousy sleep well

Innocence is heaven
Innocence is hell
Innocence in everyone
Innocence is dead

Four and twenty black boys
Singing in the street
Getting high on most things
Wishing they were free

My angel, my devil
My hell, my heaven
My storm, my calm
My photograph, my palm

Four and twenty white boys
Singing in the the street
Getting high on most things
Wishing they were free

I've been your preacher
I've been your boy
I've been your teacher
I've been your joy
I've been your drunk
I've been your home
I've been your rock
You've been my stone

Four and twenty poor boys 
Singing in the street
Getting high on most things
Wishing they were free
