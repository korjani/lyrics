Stop tap drink back eye on you
You're out to find that something new
Am i the fly you want trapped in your web

I've seen that look a thousand times
Your innocence can make you blind
I can show you round a block or two

Let me introduce you to my friends
Let me buy you things, let me in your head
Let us fly away let this never end
My friend
My friend

Kick back think back look at you
You got the look you got the shoes
I'd like to fill your world and be with you
Your lust for life just turns me on
A star above that's shining on
Think i'd like to see the world like you

Let me introduce you to my friends
Let me buy you things, let me in your head
Let us fly away let this never end
