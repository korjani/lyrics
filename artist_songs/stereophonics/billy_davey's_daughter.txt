I never knew her name 
I only knew her fame 
she lived near my town 
another goldfish to drown 
well I just past the bridge 
that parts us from them the bridge 
that she used again and again again 
I remember when they found her 
billy davey's daughter the word gets around 
billy davey's second daughter threw herself 
to dirty water billy's left with nothing but a 
dream he dreams
