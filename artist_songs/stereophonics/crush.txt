We swapped our lines late last night then
We started talking truths til noon
Yeah noon
We fantasize of kidnap tie me up and tease me in your boots
Yeah you

I like to feel the crush it makes me feel alive
To have you in my life, than not it just feels right
And when the sun goes down the moonlight paints the night
That's when the sleeping dog awakes and comes alive

I like to fight for the right to light up a cigarette for you
Boo hoo
Although the timing's not right, my head spins around and round for you
Yeah you

I like to feel the crush it makes me feel alive
To have you in my life, than not it just feels right
And when the sun goes down the moonlight paints the night
That's when the sleeping dog awakes and comes alive

Come back now
Come back now
Come back and stay
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
It's alright, it's alright it makes me feel alive
To have you in my life, than not it just feels right
I'm alive
