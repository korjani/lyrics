She came from Providence 
The one in Rhode Island 
Where the old world shadows 
Hang heavy in the air 
She packed her hopes and dreams like a refugee 
Just as her father came across the sea 
She heard about a place people were smilling 
They spoke about the red mans way 
And how they loved the land 
And they came from everywhere to the Great Divide 
Seeking a place to stay or a place to hide 
Down in the crowded bars 
Out for the good time 
Can't wait to tell you all what its like up there 
They called it paradise 
I dont know why 
Somebody laid the mountains low 
While the town got high 
Then the chilly winds blew down 
Across the desert 
Through the canyons of the coast to the Malibu 
Where the pretty people play 
Hungry for power 
To light their neon ways and give them things to do 
Some rich men came and raped the land 
Nobody caught em 
Put up a bunch of boxes and Jesus people bought 'em 
They called it paradise 
The place to be 
They watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea 
You can leave it all behind and sail to Lahaina 
Just like the missionaries did so many years ago 
They even brought a neon sign "Jesus is coming" 
Brought the white mans burden down 
Brought the white mans reign 
Who will provide the grand design ? 
What is yours and what is mine ? 
Cause there is no more new frontier 
We have got to make it here 
We satisfy our endless needs 
And justify our bloody deeds 
In the name of destiny 
And in the name of God 
And you can see them there on Sunday morning 
Stand up and sing about what its like up there 
They call it paradise 
I dont know why 
You call some place paradise 
Kiss it goodbye
