Black and blue, I'm sick of you,
its time that you get out my life,
You bring me down,
Lack of sleep its killing me I think its time to close my eyes, for a while

I almost touched it, but then it slipped right through my hands,
Could almost see it, then it slipped right out my mind,

I want you to show me, I know you know how,
To live every moment,
Like they don't count
Teach me to love you,
Shine me the light
Cos i'm in the darkness,
Its time i got out

Cracked, and wounded down and out,
Its time the bleeding got cleaned up
Stitch me up,

I almost touched it, but then it slipped right through my hands,
could almost see it, then it slipped right out my mind.

I want you to show me, I know you know how,
To live every moment,
Like they don't count
Teach me to love you,
Shine me the light
Cos i'm in the darkness,
Its time i got out

I want you to show me, just show me, then shine me the light
wont you show me, just show me, shine me the light
wont you show me, just show me, shine me the light
Show me how, show me how, show me how, show me how, show me how, show me how, show me how, Shine the light on me, on me

Wont you show me how to live every moment, shine me the light of your soul, and teach me how to love like you do, like its the last day of the world.
