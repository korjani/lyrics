When the stars burn down and the earth wears out
and we stand before the throne,
With the witnesses who have gone before,
We will rise and all applaud.

Singing, "Blessing and honor and glory and power forever to our God." [2x]

When the hands of time wind fully down
And the earth is rolled up like a scroll,
The trumpets will call and the world will fall to its knees as we go home.

Singing, "Blessing and honor and glory and power forever to our God." [4x]

Star of the morning
Light of salvation
Majesty

God of all mysteries
Lord of the universe
Righteous king
[repeat]

There will come a day, standing face to face, in a moment we'll be like Him.
He will wipe our eyes dry and take us up to His side
And forever we will be His.

Singing, "Blessing and honor and glory and power forever to our God." [repeat]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Forever to our God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
