All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go

First they built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around and around
And all we see
Are kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said?

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see
We're still kids in buses
Longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours, that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live
