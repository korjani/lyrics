You're the one that they used to hate
But they like you now
And everything that goes away
Will be returned somehow
They're the ones that spit on you
Cause they got no heart
I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc

You had a vision they couldn't see so
They put you down
But everything that you said would happen
It came around
And they're the ones that put you down
Cause they got no heart
But I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

[Chorus 1]
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

Now they tell you that you're their muse
Yeah, they're so inspired
But where were they when they called your name
And they lit the fire?
When the voices came, you cut your hair
But you're still confused
But I'm the one with a heavy heart
Cause I'll follow you

[Chorus 2]
My Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
When the boys are over you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

I really wanna know you

[Regine Chassagne]
Tu dis que tu es mon juge
Mais je ne te crois pas
Alors tu dis que je suis une sainte
Mais ce n'est pas moi
J'entends des voix
Mais ce n'est pas moi
Je ne suis pas Jeanne d'Arc
And if you shoot you better hit your mark

[Chorus 2]

Joan, it's true
I only wanna know you
Joan, it's true, it's true
I only wanna know you
But Joan
I only wanna know you

First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
And then they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
Love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again
They love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again
