Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids

People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter

People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya
Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]
Every time you close your eyes [x4]

People try and hide the night
Underneath the covers
People try and hide the light
Underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Hidin' from your brothers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers

People say that you'll die 
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter

Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]

Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
