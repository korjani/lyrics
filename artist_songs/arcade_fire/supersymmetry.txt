I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive
I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive

If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess you'll have to fight
If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess we'll have to fight

I lived for a year, in the bed by the window
Reading books, better than memories
Wanna feel the seasons passing
Wanna feel the spring

Of supersymmetry

It's been a while since I've been to see you
I don't know where, but you're not with me
Heard a voice, like an echo
But it came from me

Ah, lalala lala

Ah, lalala lala
