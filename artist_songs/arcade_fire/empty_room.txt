Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

You were burning out, you're black and gray
You were burning out, you're black and gray
Something I would never say

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars
