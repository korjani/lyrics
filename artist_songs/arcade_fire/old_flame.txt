You knew in five minutes, 
But I knew in a sentence 
You knew in five minutes, 
But I knew in a sentence 

So why do we go through all of this again? 
Your eyes are flutterin' 
Such pretty wings. 
A moth, flyin' into the 
Same old flame again 
It never ends 

It's not like I dropped the bomb, 
on my conscience mom 
It takes fightin' day and night 
to make such a good thing die 

Out, everyone out 
I give too much shit at home 
In my heart and mind 
It gets me every time 

So why do we go 
Through all this shit again 
Your eyes are Flutterin' 
Such pretty wings. 
A moth flyin' into me 
The same old flame again 
It never ends
