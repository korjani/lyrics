Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Your daddy really took it out of you

But did he speak it in tongues?
But did he speak it in tongues?

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Where did we lose our way?

It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Now I can't understand a word

Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)

Come out of your head
And into my world now

Come out of your head
And into my world, my world, my world now

(Speaking in tongues)
(To end)
