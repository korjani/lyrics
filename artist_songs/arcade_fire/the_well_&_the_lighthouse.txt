I'm serving time
All for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead
Heaven is only in my head!

I heard a voice
Calling from down inside the well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell
Down into the water black
My prison cell
Only the moon was shining back!

If I seem lost, well I weighted the cost
And chose my crime
Now it's mine all mine!

I heard the voice
Calling from just outside the well
She said, "You fool, now that you know your end is near
You always fall for what you desire or what you fear!"

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
If you leave them ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
Can you see the funny side, the ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
Sleeping yet
Sleeping yet
Sleeping yet
