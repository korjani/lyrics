I regained the breathe of the last man
I'm so relaxed soon we are the blessed one
I will recollect the body manifest
And puff a cigarette, six sicker
Body flip 'em wrists, who could give a shit
If mama showed how the fuck it's done
Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready

[Sample]

Bullets like I'm fetty
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same ma?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slit
Knot then we hang
Pretty pushy broad
Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch
