How's it feel? How's it feel with your broken heart?
Can't reveal, can't reveal all these fucking scars
Hurt me now, kill the pain, this is just the start
Kill me now, numb the pain, I just wanna stop
Run away, run away from my broken heart
Kill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start
Run away, run away from my broken heart
Kill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start
Heart broken, no one can feel me
Heart open, with an incision
You broke it, too many faces running
I'm nothing, I'm nothing different
