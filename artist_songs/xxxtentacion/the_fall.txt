Fool's gold is a common man's trash.
I've seen God, I've seen devils, I've seen many men...
Mothers, children, fathers...
I've seen The Fall
Fucking being serious

Black bands and the, black friends when the
Nigga feelin' so killer could put a kids in a
Chokehold. Them living with no soul
A pity, how niggas pity me, kitty with no goals.
I jump, fall, neck snaps, I Slipknot
I told em cold in the weather so we can get-got
M5, two of them, we fucked in
And I remember December when you was tucked in place
Is the place, man it's cold, and they chose this place so you could never fall.
So beware because the fall is all we know,
an empty corpse around parading in the snow.
Fuck.

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Yea, yeah
Aye, yea

THIS IS IT
Yea, this is all we know, this is all we know.
Y-y-y-yea.
This is-this is it.
Yea, y-y-y-yea.
This is-th-this is all we know, this is all we know.
This is it.
Yea, yea, yea
This is all we know this is all we know, this is it.
Yea, yea, yea...
