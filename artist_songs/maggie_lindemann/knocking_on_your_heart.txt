[Verse 1:]
Nothing makes it hard to breathe
Like being in your company
When you've got someone new around your arms
I thought I'd be over it
To see you lock with other lips
I guess I'm just no good at moving on

[Pre-chorus:]
I always tried to tell myself
That I'd fall in love with someone else
But, oh, my stubborn heart is set on you
And every night I fall asleep
Just so I can see you in my dreams
And now I think you ought to know the truth

[Chorus:]
Are you listening?
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?
Tell me I'm the one and I've always been
'Cause I don't wanna wonder if we'll ever meet again
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?

[Verse 2:]
When you left I made you swear
Our love would last no matter where
And we would call each other every night
But nights turned into weeks, turned into months
We didn't speak
And so we lost our sense of love over time

[Pre-chorus:]
I always tried to tell myself
That I'd fall in love with someone else
But, oh, my stubborn heart is set on you
And every night I fall asleep
Just so I can see you in my dreams
And now I think you ought to know the truth

[Chorus:]
Are you listening?
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?
Tell me I'm the one and I've always been
'Cause I don't wanna wonder if we'll ever meet again
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?

I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?

[Chorus:]
Are you listening?
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?
Tell me I'm the one and I've always been
'Cause I don't wanna wonder if we'll ever meet again
I'm knocking on your heart. Could you let me in?
