The sun has come up and the time is here
I stare into your room and see that your still not there
I'm reflecting the parametics, and it's all falling apart
Your heart stands still, but time moves on
Whoever thought that it could go wrong
It's infectious and pathetic
and we're all falling apart

Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I tried to help, but you won't let me
be the one to change your mind
is it so hard to see
Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I tried to help, but you help let me
be the one to change your mind
it's hard to believe

The screams rang out throught the night once he fell
and the knife runs deep, like a needle casted spell
I'm reflecting when I said it and you were falling apart
you grabbed your keys and closed the door
on the life that you didn't wana live anymore
It's infectious yet poetic
you have fallen apart

Don't fade away, I won't turn the page
Don't fade away...

Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I'll do anything just to make you breathe

Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I tried to help, but you won't let me
be the one to change your mind
is it so hard to see
Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I tried to help, but you help let me
be the one to change your mind
it's hard to believe

(Don't fade away)
Tell me, that you're watching over me
Tell me, you're watching over me
