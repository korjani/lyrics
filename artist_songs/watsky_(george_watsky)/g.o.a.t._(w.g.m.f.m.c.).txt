[Guy:] Haha ha ha, that was funny man
[Watsky:] That was funny?
[G:] Yeah. So what's the, uh, what's the real track 4, though?
[W:] The real track?
[G:] Yeah. That's- you're not actually gonna put that on the record though
[W:] Yeah. That's actually track number 4 on the record
[G:] Watsky
[W:] I'm telling you man, it's not a stretch. It's possible to be funny and serious at the same time
Y'know. Poignant
[G:] Watsky
[W:] Yes?
[G:] You have to like, disrespect women and talk about clubs and shit, like, that's really important nowadays. That's what they want on the radio man
[W:] Y'know, it's a track about, y'know, juvenile epilepsy and I feel like it'll be touching and-
[G:] See okay- You shouldn't have gone anywhere past juvenile. Think JUVENILE. You didn't say bitch ONE TIME IN THAT RECORD
[W:] No, but at the end of that, eh-
[G:] Sprinkle it man. Sprinkle some disrespect on it
[W:] Sprinkle it?
[G:] Sprinkle a little disrespect on it. There's no disrespect on the record, it's too nice
You need to have the big fucking glasses, a funny hat, where's your T-Pain effect?
I want you to go back, go home, and write a better song with more bitches, fuck more peoples'... mothers. and sisters. and brothers. and grandmothers and shit
Then come back here, and we'll talk
[W:] Lemme bounce with the beat for a second. No homo

Uhm, yeah. Whoo!
Get in bed like I'm at war
Make your vagina more than kinda sore
I'm hung like a dinosaur
Shit your hymen tor
You're busted
You never grew up like a Toys R Us kid
I'm well-adjusted like jock strap crutches
Bang my old teachers while the preschool watches
Met a slow girl, I was fucking her fast
Had some tight old pussy and got stuck in the PAASSSTTTT
I molest old age, Grab the best old babe, in a breast hold babe
Is your chest cold babe?
Are those boobs your goosebumps?
Hey sugar tits, can a pimp have two lumps?
Measure my heart prick, whatever the night
I use my dick as a yardstick to measure my height!
I'm healing myself, I have a hole in my pocket
And I'm feeling myself
I'm like WuTang, your arts cookie cutter like a Warhol soup can
The rapper who can destroy mere humans
Fuck your facelift, fuck you're played whip
I built a spaceship, to ride in while you're crusing Earth
Lampooning all the aliens that emcee in the Universe!
The ten best rappers is a list of me
I exist to be, the greatest rapper in history
Built a time machine from Flava's clock and a saddle
Taught Plato to rap, then kicked his ass in a battle
I'm the best rapper alive
That gets mistaken for Michael Cera everywhere he drives
FUCK MICHAEL CERA
You weren't so super bad
When I was writing and
You were running around Rodeo yelling
"Who's your dad?"
UH!
Man, fuck this
