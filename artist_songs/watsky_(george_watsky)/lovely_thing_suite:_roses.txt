Don't let my ghost drag you down
If you don't see me around
It doesn't mean that I fell
Yeah I'm doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I'm gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell

When magic's happening my habit's been coiling up a memory and trappin it right
In the cavity of my ribs, like the doors of a cabinet might
But you won't hold onto a shadow just by grabbing it tight
Set it free and let it back in the light
Never out of my heart, even when out of my sight
Leaving is sposed to be hard
Man I thought it so was selfish of people I love to keep falling out of my life
But now I know
No I don't take it personal
If you got a really lovely place to go
I will chase my goals yeah, to make me whole
Cause it's urgent we love and be loved
I've begun to scrub up with detergent to shine up my soul

Don't let my ghost drag you down
If you don't see me around
It doesn't mean that I fell
Yeah I'm doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I'm gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell

Cause every screen the we tap is screaming that bigger is better
Better is how you make yourself matter
But matter is fleeting
Am I living to feed a machine that I'm blind to see?
No point in hiding my pride if there's no privacy
I've already dedicated too much of my time to trying to get my followers up
And crying out for attention
And sleeping around to mend a hollow crater inside of me
Knowing well that it don't mean shit
Going to the well for another cheap dopamine hit
I'm done being a bitch to ambition
I'm already rich
I got a head that's full of million dollar questions
And the length of it
Is I don't need the courage to work
I want the strength to quit

Don't let my ghost drag you down
If you don't see me around
It doesn't mean that I fell
Yeah I'm doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I'm gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell
