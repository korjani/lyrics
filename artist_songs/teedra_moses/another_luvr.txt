[Verse 1: Wale]
Uh, so deep love you shorty never to see you
Revem you keep me inspired baby, they'll never be us
I know world cold, I know I had you open
So when she see me how she like "I guess your phone broke"
I'm like naw shorter, you see I'm more focused
Women pray for that long distance, I just long stroke'em
New love, the newness of it is beautiful
When too involved with it, it usually do implode
I need change like C notes headed to toes
Its not a game but if it was I be the cold
I'm down with you, for now with you
And bad decisions I'm making cause of this brown liquor
I'm playing with you but look I'm staying with you
Got your panties knit in Semera, cause I'm staring at you
Who here with you, tell'em we getting missing
Tell'em them dogs I'm sending at'em bigger than Clifford

[Verse 2: Teedra Moses]
Forever I called for you, you never answered
Reached out my arms for you, you never reached back
Losing my mind to find a way to get back again
Yeah baby I wanna die for you, nothing so different
Now I'm like...(I just want another lover)
All I want (I just want another lover)
Don't want you ( I just want another lover)
I'm moving on ( I just want another lover)
And he's got to be (It's got to be good)
Gotta be cool (It's got to be cool)
I want the truth (It's got to be the truth)
I just wanna another lover
You make me want another
(I wanna another lover)

[Verse 3: Teedra Moses]
Gave all I had to be your number 1
With no hesitation, I would do anything for you
Losing myself inside a love that was unreal
Never thought the day would come when I would feel how I feel right now
Boy I (I just wanna lover)
All I want (I just wanna lover)
I don't want you (I just wanna lover)
I'm moving on (I just wanna lover)
And it's got to be (It's got to be good)
Gotta be cool (It's got to be cool)
I want the truth (It's got to be the truth)
I just wanna another lover
You make me want another
(I wanna another lover)
