Four thousand years ago, I came back to my senses
Jumped on a laser ray and blew into a new dimension
This vertical line, I watch it go by

Chop down your master plan in nanoseconds, man
I hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus:]
I can feel it
Overheating
So bad, it makes me want to cry
I can feel it
Overheating
A burning heart unstuck in time

Now I'm a solar flare, now I'm that light that rages
Now I'm that laser ray that blows a hole right through the ages
This vertical line, I watch it go by

Ain't got no second-hand, just got my good intentions
Just got my laser ray exploding into new dimensions
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus]

AHLAHA!
From the side, gets hot
That she could fuse us into one
If only we could take the light
Well, I got mine, yes, I got mine

Four thousand years ago, I came back to my senses
Swallowed a laser ray and blew my mind in all directions
This vertical line, I watch it go by

Chop down your master plan in nanoseconds, man
I hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus]

AHLAHA!
Seen the stars last night
We're only vehicles for life
So should your mind begin to shine
Say "hey, alright!", say "I got mine!" [x4]
