I can barely move
For want of room
And I'm forgettin' to breathe

But the sight of you
Has me instantly 
Remember my needs

Oh the lights spin
And the beat breaks in
And I'm smellin' your sweet

Should I spend the next six hours
Tryin' to get you
Off your feet?

Oh no girl, just pretend
There ain't no one else around

So let's break it down
Ooh, let's break it down

Watch a room full of roosters
Turned to cocks runnin' wild
Scramblin' like hungry dogs
Towards you, child

See those boys tryin' to sweat you
Watchin' grown men cry

Like you're shakin' it
Like you're shakin' it
Like you're shakin' it

Put somethin' in their eyes
Oh wide open eyes

Well here I am
Just a man
Is this light flattering?
Did you notice my crown of feathers
And check out my vital vibrant comb?
Oh puff chest out and play strong
Grab you by the hair and pull you along

Or do I just talk to you
And tell you what I really
Really really want to do

Stop because you think that you
Know where this is going
Couldn't stop it girl
If you knew where this was going
You don't know the half

You seem so so smart
Ooh, but you're so wrong

Closing time
Pale blue lights gonna shine
In through any open window
Nighttime says goodbye

Let's pursue this argument in darkness
Curtains drawn, limbs entwined

Now you're two hours away
From starting your day
And you can't be late
So let's get straight

Let me wear you out
Let me wear you out

Let me make you mine, mine, mine
Let me make you mine, mine, mine
