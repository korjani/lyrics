Beg the bee's forgiveness as it's falling from your sleeve
Watch its guts pump poison into sting
Watch it reach completeness, see it fall asleep
Legs above fold in eternal dream

Oh that calls to mind a joke, an off coloring
About these fools blindfolded, drugged, and raped and left laughing
They let the devil in, he brought his pirate friends
They brought a hunger for blood, and flesh and bone and skin

So teeth left chattering, and tongues flexed to sing
Got dressed up in so many fancy things

Is it a waste of time, please tell me if you mind
Me dipping into useless sentimentality
A rant on how things used to be when this shit was free
I answered my own question, I can hear the crickets yawning

But in the back pocket of a discarded pair of jeans
Is still a priceless ticket to the grandest opening
So when the chariot arrives, you'd best enjoy the ride
Cause when we get to heaven's gate, we're not getting inside

Better beg forgiveness
Better drop to knees
Better find your ticket
Before we join the bees
