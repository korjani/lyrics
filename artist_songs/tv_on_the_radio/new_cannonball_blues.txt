Hey girls, hey boys no don't mind the noise
It's just the sound of being dragged ahead

It's just a pornographic annulationship
As we watch the spider's web eat itself

All this death above extinguishing
All that you've ever known

Turn your touch screens off and start harvesting
The seeds that your parents sew 

It's got me singing blues that hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones
But it was written in blood before they wrote it in stone
So, sing it with me like it's your own

You're gettin' bothered staying low like under four hundred blows 
Makes you feel like you are all by yourself

So when the chance comes along like where you could help right a wrong
The bullshit's got you stuck up on the shelf

"But it's heavy"
"I'm not ready"
Do you feel like you're swimming in the notes?

But baby, follow the sound
That's shooting out of your crown
There's only one way up from the floor

It's got me fucked up and dried up and fed up can't get up 
And bleeding and crying like I'm mad at the soul

"I'm a carbon copy
Now they got me" 
Up oh look at where we're going

It's got you strung out and bothered and caught up
And drowning and feeling and shot up
And feeling you gotta run

You're a carbon copy
Now they got me 
Up oh look at where we're going

Now gonna kick toe
Gonna run right forward
Lord not the first time we've imposed a locked door
Oh critter fight back it's your sole reward
Below with your fist up 
Brush the dust off
Boy, it's got got it's got me singing

Blues that hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones
But it was written in blood before they wrote it in stone
So sing it with me like it's your own

Those blues they hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones

But wish the rising in love before we're taking the throne
So sing it with me like it's your own
You better dust off and get up, get ready to push up
Hey baby get ready 'cause yea yea it's gonna come

If we want to see what's possible for a, a better way right now
You better dust off and get up, get ready to push up
Hey baby get ready 'cause yea yea it's gonna come

When the truth is spoken
Love's unbroken
Nothing's gonna weigh us down
