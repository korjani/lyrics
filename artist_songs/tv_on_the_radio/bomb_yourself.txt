Bomb your country
Shed no tear
TV dinner
Overfed your fears

So make your money
And spread your seed
Better lap of luxuries
But acknowledge need

You've made a family
Now kill 'em dead
Oh it's not me, ma
It's what the TV said

Your final fantasy
For your final days
Oh baby it's the infancy

Oh in so many ways (bomb your country)
Then sit and smile
Why don't you lay back easy
Just wait a while
Just wait a while

So baby, bomb your country
Sit and smile
Why don't you lay back easy
Just wait a while
Just wait a while
