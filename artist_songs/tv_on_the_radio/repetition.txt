Trouble ahead of its time 
Is the fate of the fish washed up on shore 
Do you know that he just won't feel right 
Till he's swallowed up by the tide 
Thought it might know better 

Born into capital lifestyle heights 
Got a head full of fever and it feels all right 
Cause I shake my bottle and I suck my swill 
And I love how I'm living cause I've got my fill 
But I can't stop thinking how it's all gone wrong 
And the cracks will be obvious before too long 

I've abused my position and it cost my friends 
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again 

What's the matter with your next-door neighbour 
I heard he had sex, drugs and danger 
You can kick it with a complete stranger 
I think I hear him calling 

What's the matter with your next-door neighbour 
An act of man, a freak of nature 
You've been kicking with a complete stranger 
I think I hear him calling 

And the time on your hands is a walk in the park 
If it don't then I hope you can see in the dark (real hard) 
Hail Mary, watch your life unfold 
I'm a man on a mission or so I've been told 

I can choose my victims, I could shed my skin 
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again 
But I can't stop thinking that it's all gone wrong 
And the truth will be obvious before too long 

I've abused my position and it cost my friends 
If the world keeps turning I'mma do it again 

What's the matter with your next-door neighbour 
I heard he had sex, drugs and danger 
But you can kick it with a complete stranger 
I think I hear him calling 

What's the matter with your next-door neighbour 
An act of god, a freak of nature 
You've been kicking with a complete stranger 
I think the curtain's falling down 

We lock eyes and walk away unrecognised 
We lock arms and spin 
Commence our repetition 

My repetition, my repetition is this 
My repetition, my repetition is this 
My repetition, my repetition is this...
