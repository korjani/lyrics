Oh, it's the winter of the wanted
Yeah, it's the hardest part of nature
Lord, have mercy on this creature
Give me some heat, I know you've got it
And who knows what the summer's gonna bring us?
Comes on slow, gotta keep the fire in us

So completely in the dark now
I hope that night will last forever
Yeah, you know I like it better
When we're a little bit frightened

And we'll go where nobody's gonna know us

Got my eyes wide open now
I can see the storm ahead of me
I say "go" cause I know it's gonna clean us
No control, let the physical redeem us

This is my confession, yeah
Think I'll learn my lesson, yeah
This is my confession, yeah

Can you hear me calling out
Like a siren to a sailor?
Only trip that last forever
Let the ocean take us over now
Gotta know that there's a chemistry between us
Gonna show that I want you and I need it

Let the lightning strike me down now
As long as we're together
Can't think of nothing better
Than a union in the afterglow
Let it go, all the thinking and the reason
Here we go to the lovin' and the pleasin'

Lay me down, if you know
Let's go out, I'm ready for
Gently now, we can go on
Gonna keep you for the winter
Gonna keep you for the winter
Gonna keep you for the winter
Gonna keep you for the
