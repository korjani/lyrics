Stuck in the shade
Where there's no sunshine
I don't wanna play
With them other kids in the sun

Since you left me babe
It's been a long way down
Yea you left me babe
It's been a long way down

What you don't know won't hurt you yea
Ignorance is bliss
I'm a happy idiot 
Waving at cars
I'm gonna bang my head to the wall
'Till I feel like nothing at all
I'm a happy idiot 
To keep my mind off you

Stuck in a daze and I've lost my mind
I don't wanna stay
Where the blame's all mine

Since you left me babe
It's been a long way down
Yea you left me babe
It's been a long way down

So I shut it off
So I shut it all off
So I shut it off
So I shut it all off

It's been a long way down
It's been a long way down

What you don't know won't hurt you yea
Ignorance is bliss
I'm a happy idiot 
Waving at cars
I'm gonna bang my head to the wall
'Till I feel like nothing at all
I'm a happy idiot 
To keep my mind off you
To keep my mind off you
To keep my mind off you
