Now drop yourself with no concern 
On how to breathe 
When your mind is burned 
On optimistic, on overload 
Can we shift the heat back 
To when your heart's grown cold 

In severed light 
Our souls are damaged 
And with that caged 
To the cause of light 
Now I can see 
Another language 
Gone optimistic 
We're gonna survive 

We're the tail-end of the sun 
To a greener hideaway 
Where in peace I found my fun 
Till I heard the future say 

I'm in an army, a megaquake 
A force of nature 
All hell ashake 
Improve our days now, cause we might not sleep tonight 
Suffused are we to the cause of light! 

On optimistic 
On overload 
Can we shift the heat back 
To when your heart's grown cold 
And now we know why 
And know what we must do 
Aware of the cracks 
The heart shines through 

We're the tail-end of the sun 
To a greener hideaway 
Where in peace I found my fun 
Till I heard the future say 

We're the tail-end of the sun 
To a greener hideaway 
Where in peace I found my fun 
Till I heard the future... 

(Would you believe my life was all right) 
A bed of roses 
And rollercoasters 
(Would you believe my life was so fine) 
A bed of roses 
And rollercoasters 
A bed of roses 
And rollercoasters
