Your voice was a satellite spinning next to me
Now I can't hear
Over the radio, someone said a satellite just went down into the sea
So I go
I fathom leagues
I am the undertow
I wait peacefully
Now I'm waiting for a signal or a sound
Where can you be found now, my love?
Where can you be?
Waiting for a signal or a sound
