Playhouses
Swept away by the river now
Confounded
Sound it out now

Vodka cran in your hand and whose litte girl are you now?
Oh I'd ask for this dance but I know you'd play like you don't know how
What your coy smile exposes
A recent memory of when we shit our bed of roses

And I know the moon above is shining down
But not for our love
So for who?
So for who?

Beneath the cigarettes and sugar shit of alcohol breath
I can taste the ocean of your tongue
Remember when we sat on the sidewalk of your old block
Against the wall under the stars
Talking about love's meaning
Well, I wasn't dreaming

I meant every word 
Just didn't know your demons
Do you know mine, babe?
Are we wasting time, babe?

Playhouses
Haunted by
Broken spirits
Just trying to get high

Well we chose this course but
The weather changed
And the river froze
And when it thawed it was running
Backwards and dry now
I suppose it's appropriate to cry now

Over wasted time
And naked lies
Still get wasted sometimes
