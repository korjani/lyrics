After the rain
A killer crane
After the rainbow

Across the sky
Her grace's glide
Across the sea

Across creation
And over time
Her gracious life
Escapes its station

A cold wind blows
The day bestows
Glum proclamation

Leave it behind
Your restless mind
Your jealousies
But isolation
Demands your patience

To be found together in time just to say

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what is mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

And after all
We're free to fall
Once all the pain goes
And how we stood
And what was good
Could lie us all long

In isolation
A transformation

Blue laughter leaves me
Leaves me blue
Emboldened on to see it through
This life of love and lighting go
A killer crane
After a rainbow

May they found together in time to say

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what was mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

Sunshine come crawling through the hanging vines
A memory of what is mine fading away
In this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what is mine fading away
And this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid
