[Verse 1:]
Brace yourself cause here we come 
Us three unite to become one and get this party started 
So get up outta your chair cause we're taking you there not a worry or care 
Gonna dance until you feel it all in your soul 
Come on and lose control 
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you wanna be 
[Chorus:]
We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot 
So lets go we keep it moving 
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town 
Because we're down for the get down 
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it 
Shock through your system when you listen to it 
Rock to this beat you hear me pumping through your town 
Because we're down for the get down 

[Verse 2:]
We're here to let you know that we ain't foolin around 
When the music hits your body it's hard to sit down 
So everybody get on up and dance away your blues 
Grab somebody show them that you're down for the get down too 
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you wanna be 

[Chorus:]
We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot 
So lets go we keep it moving 
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town 
Because we're down for the get down 

[Bridge:]
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it 
Shock through your system when you listen to it 
Rock to this beat you hear me pumping through your town 
Because we're down for the get down 
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you wanna be 

[Chorus:]
We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot
