I woke up around two
The sun was shinin' on me
Pressed my jeans, cleaned my shoes
Filled up the ride and floored it
Top dropped down, vibe on cool
Let's see what flavors roamin'
'Cause I don't wanna be with nothin' and I don't feel like pushin'
Nothin' short of the red line, the spot is hot now
Call my crew 'cause they know how to party
Got to make sure I'm smooth, dressed to impress I'm 'bout it
All I wanna do is ride

So let's roll, you know,
How, we do, when I'm in a state of mind to cruise It's so simple
Put the pedal to the steel and let it go

Cruzin' with my homies, Youngstown in full effect,
Gotta go and cash my check, and find something to do
But for now we're
Ridin',
Slidin' havin a good time
Just so sublime, findin' peace of mind, in my ridin' time.
Radio's playin' my favorite song, tell my buy to turn it up
The day is short but the road is long, so lets burn it up
When the sun goes down that's okay, keep ridin' away,
It's been one hell of a day, doin' things my own way

[RAP]
Let's ride I got the keys to the Expo Rimslow,
let's go no matter where we go we rock the show
Radio loud drawing a crowd, party's at the spotlight
we rock the mic hyp from Chi-Town to Y-
Town, we gets down look what I found some girls in a rover
pull over got to get that number real
Quick. Yo baby wzup I like your truck your smiles
makin' me blush rolling with Youngstown
Is a must, that's right you know how we do
me and my crew mob action relaxing and stacking
Them chips Kel Rock and them Y-town kids
so throw your hands up and let's roll- come on y'all
