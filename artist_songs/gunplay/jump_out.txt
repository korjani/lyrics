Pulling up, jumping out, pulling up, jumping out
Pulling up, jumping out, pulling up, jumping out
Pulling up, jumping out, pulling up, jumping out
Pulling up, jumping out, pulling up, jumping out
Boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to
Boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to

[Verse 1]
I'm pulling up I'm putting down
Looping up I'm jumping out
Ok, here come that trouble now
Turn your hood to Lebanon
Sling it all, slay them all, let them die
Praise the lord, raise him up, they thought I raised the floor
Boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to
Boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to, boy I'm bout to
I'm pulling up I'm putting down
Looping up I'm jumping out
Ok, here come that shit you want
Leave alive, bet you won't
We ain't letting nothing slide
Choppa okay nothing hide
I'm a human LA Riot, G-U-N-P-L-A-Y!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Boy this ain't no TV shit
Ain't no seen before for my nigga
I got artillery that yeen see before my nigga
Too many toolys, no Home Depot my nigga
Charge this RICO my nigga, all this perico my nigga
I got them sliders on my side, you die if they decide
With that pump to that Polo horse, dump on yo desire
What the fuck is Gunplay thinking, what he drinking, moonshine?
Double desert eagle, that's illegal 2 times
I'm riding like it should have did
Mighta, coulda, woulda did
Killa had a body that, I'm forever not afraid
Long as I got my chopsticks and a box of copper heads
I get ratchet with my ratchet till I see my proper ends

[Hook]
