[Intro]

[Verse:]
I got signed, ain't shit change
I still sell crack, cocaine, loud and mid grade
Niggas talking money, ain't bank nothing yet
Niggas talking bout killing, ain't stank nothing yet
When a nigga slide whole hood said they heard I did it
Threw the throwaways in the air like a Shmurda fitted
Nigga got them hundreds and they coming for your neck
Bitch, I'm about a hundred, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Sold so much dope, man, I should've been the plug
Down with S double M, man, I should've been a blood
Rolling choppa in the club, but it should've been a slug
Tried to be a rapper, but I should've been a thug
Self made definition, razorblade on the dishes
Hoes let me cut, razorblade on them bitches
Gunplay, "Mr. Bible on the Dash"
Don Logan, "Mr. Rifle in the Stash"
I'm a real nigga, ain't scared of the law
Ain't scared of y'all or what ya'll yelling out ya jaw
AK flip clip, that's a mini Draco
Swinging that thing like Jose Canseco

[Outro]
