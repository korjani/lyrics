[Hook - Gunplay:]
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Bang) (Aye)
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Mang) (Aye)
I'm chain smokin' in my chain
(I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin')

[Verse 1 - Stalley:]
I be picking through the stickiest of greenery
28 grams on my Cuban link
Riding shirtless in the TransAm bumpin' Cuban links
Cardies on my face, diamonds in my pinkie ring
Midwest nigga from the streets to the kitchen sink
Grape switcher sweets and a box of Middletons
I go straight to my connect, I don't need a middle man
A zip of blue dream and platinum cookies
This is big dog smoke school, we don't toke with rookies
And my jewels give you that 1989 feel
All solid 24k from david and will
4g out of real on my '76 Seville
Ridin' slow through the hills
I'm Beverly, one toke, two tokes
Got me feeling heavenly
Top down riding around chain smokin'
Chain pokin' for all a y'all to see
And my nigga Gunplay tell em bring some more weed

[Hook - Gunplay:]
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Bang) (Aye)
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Mang) (Aye)
I'm chain smokin' in my chain
(I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin')

[Verse 2 - Curren$y:]
Niggas try to sound like grime lipe [?]
Say they get high like the one in the bubblegum blue 52
Bel Air at the fair rollin gold shoes
Whole shoes fans fair
Very rare you find an ounce of this shit anywhere
Cuz you incredibly square
Nobody trust you, you actin like the feds
Smokin' to my head
Cuz the one that I wanna pass the doobie to dead
My momma and my girlfriend scared, cuz I be outside
But don't worry baby, I know how to play it
Watching while I'm blazin', all my jury on
OG in the bomb space station, home basis
From the club to the fool spot
We all racing, we got paper
We all make it fast as we can spend it
Take a new hundred, roll that weed in it

[Hook - Gunplay:]
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Bang) (Aye)
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Mang) (Aye)
I'm chain smokin' in my chain
(I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin')

[Verse 3 - Gunplay:]
I'm khal jokins [?], chain smokin'
In a sem tray[?], Chevrolet, everyday chokin'
And the paint like white cocaine
My dog say match when I'm like "okay"
Fresh paper, raw paper
Trippy stick, kush or
The color syrup maple
All vapor
To the crib, this bad bitch
I'm gon' take her, then wife her, then break up
Leather seats
My swisher forever sweet
Fresh off probation let's celebr-eat
They be tardy for the party but I'm never late
Put the fire to the tip 'til I levitate
Four strands, loud as four bands
Tryna hold smoke, she tryna hold hands
This shit fire like I'm rolling up a sun
On a back to back run
Coughing up a lung

[Hook - Gunplay:]
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Bang) (Aye)
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Mang) (Aye)
I'm chain smokin' in my chain
(I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin')
