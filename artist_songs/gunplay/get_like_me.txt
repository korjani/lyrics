[Intro:]
Pardon the interruption for this little smoke break
It's Evil Empire
Where nobody broke
They be free
I know
Uh

[Verse 1:]
Man if you try and catch me got to get like me and match me
If a dollar sign on that motherfucker attachment
No disrespect but my life ain't been nothing classic
Just gangsta booze, remy, mars, no cassies
I crank up, I turn, big bangin the herb
Heavy anchor swingin forth and back on my shirt
All these pretty bitches back attackin my nerve
This dick in her mouth, that's what her actions deserve
I serve, I swerve
I surf, I turf
I kiss my Jesus pieces while I double-cross the earth
Chillin, feelin able, willin
Linen, candy sprayed grill and bright lemon
Camel Feragamos, you ain't seen these I know
I'm a show you new shit, some shit you need to follow
I'm a leader off the meter, can't lie I often eat er
She no speakin English so I had to name her Mia

[Pre-Chorus:]
I ride on foes and turn
I'm lookin so clean today
The hoes on me
As I swing in my 60 tray

[Chorus:]
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty

[Bridge:]
I'm so clean when I pull up on them hoes
Hit the parking lot with the shoes and candy doors
Everybody knows bout this nigga round here
Everybody knows that I'm certified trill

[Chorus:]
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty

[Verse 2:]
Yo, it's Quise
She my Gipsby & Giuseppe's
Down key, shine harder than the Jesus piece where my chest be
Full C's where here chest be
My Aphrodite, love goddess
She the hottest with that mac gloss
Her lips poppin, her mouth clean
But she shit talkin, her thisty yea
Just me and my baby
Fuck them other hoes, that's my lady
If you think that she got me whipped
Fuck that, I'm a drive her crazy
Ferris wheels on my new coupe
Couple racks on her new bag
Kinda fucked up from her last dude
With that fuck nigga you was doin bad
But I want you to get like me
Will get you light likely
She picture perfect, no ID
See um, I'm intrigues by her mind
And I'm tryna make her mine
At the same time I'm stuck on her ass
Hoe what's behind that behind
So tell me that you ready
Show me that you ready
Just keep you on yo toes
So I never peddy
Fly nigga hoes want
Little mama all I need
So I never fake the phone, flip down so get like me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I ride on foes and turn
I'm lookin so clean today
The hoes on me
As I swing in my 60 tray

[Chorus:]
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty

[Bridge:]
I'm so clean when I pull up on them hoes
Hit the parking lot with the shoes and candy doors
Everybody knows bout this nigga round here
Everybody knows that I'm certified trill

[Chorus:]
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty
You need to get like me, baby
You need to get like me, Shawty
