[Verse:]
My niggas all dying, all these hoes lying
Rap niggas fake, broke niggas crying
I give my left nut to see a rat nigga frying
[?] hoes I gotta dig a dime
Niggas wanna see me in the pen, without a thing
They wanna see me fall, without a wing
Wanna see me in the winter, without a mink
Wanna see my eyes closed, without a blink
Well, fuck you and your kin then
Pop my collar and rev my engine
Big bag of dope and I'm bout to go bingin'
Throw a cocaine convention
I gotta chill, I got a deal now
So I can't kill niggas over stare downs
But over money, niggas know not to play around
You a killer? Me too, we both hell bound
They wanna know, my unknown whereabouts
They ain't happy till they know I'm in the jail house
But telling is a line I won't dare cross
We all know life just a mere cross
Don't let me do it to 'em, dear lord
My nigga it's whatever, I don't feel law

[Outro: x4]
I don't dig the part, and all mercy
