[Jay Z:]
People look at you strange saying you changed
Like you worked that hard to stay the same
Like you're doing all this for a reason
And what happens most of the time... people change
People change around you
Because they start treating you different
Because of your success

[Gunplay:]
All love to the money game
Loyalty got murdered
That's word to my mother
And my not guilty verdict

Never had a budget and I still been buzzin'
Life ain't worth shit
And it still ain't nothin
Niggas hide behind music all the time
Money can't sell ya nigga
Can't hide behind shine

Homies get rich then switch on you
Friends go broke then blitz on you
Y'all admire these liars
They ain't riding with ratchets
They don't even use pliers
Only see 'em them on the fliers

Helped build an empire then I made my own
Gunplay made Gunplay, did it all alone
Straight up solid, frame ain't [?]
Same nigga, Day one, A-1 product
Earned my keep, never turned my cheek
Slept on so long had to burn my sheets

Stayed down when they didn't
Rolled when they wouldn't
Go where they couldn't
Squeeze the trigger when I shouldn't

Went to war for my nigga
Lost a trinket in a melee
Robbed a nigga, made him dail may-day
Sold cocaine, always grade-A
Sold heroin, oxies, [?] Chevorlet brown [?] gravy
Living. Legend. All weeks [?] paydays
Bitch I'm a real nigga, trill nigga
From the bottom to the top of the hill, Nigga
