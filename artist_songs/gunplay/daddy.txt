[Hook x2: Trina]
Give it to me daddy, give, give it to me daddy
Give it to me daddy, give, give it to me daddy
Give it to me daddy, give, give it to me daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I'll give it you ya', just tell me what you want
Tell me what it do, don't tell me what it don't
Picture emotion, motion picture
Paramount pussy, slow motion hit ya'
She [?], like some sort of scripture
When I break her off, you can now fix her
I get my dick sucked, till my whip stop
And I ain't even gotta hit the ho with [?]
She go down when I roll these tints up
Knock your bitch out the park, put that censor
Mercedez, Lorenza, shining my rims up
Baby girl watch daddy get his wins up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trina]
New shoes, new bag, new this, new that
New money, old money, all that shit getting spent
Got a car on my arm, boat on my neck
Hair do stay fly, cause we are on the jet
They all yelling hot damn, what it do red?
Bad bitch, and the bottom of my shoe red
Yellow girl, same color jewelry
Such a [?] with a Blue-Ray
What color coupe I'm a cop this week
What baller I'm a break wind around, let's see
Need another Benz, head room for a Caddy
Now give it to me daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
So what the play is? What the tab like?
What it add up to? A nigga math right
Wanna ride, I'm a show you what the crash like
I'm a swerve on the curb if she act right
Bitch I'm a dog, I just wanna see a cat fight
This rubber too soft, my hat tight
Bet a pimp, never been a mack type
I'm a, right now, A.S.A.P. type
Ho quit reading all my damn tattoos
She never hear a real nigga rap that rude
Don't make a motherfucker really act that fool
Your ho sleep, better snap snooze

[Hook]
