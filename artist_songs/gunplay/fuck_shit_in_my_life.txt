[Hook]
Niggas fake, hoes snakes, stayed strapped for your sake
It's hard to maintain, it's even harder stayin' sane
With all this fuck shit in my life
Fuck shit in my life
With all this fuck shit in my life
Fuck shit in my life
Niggas, fake hoes, snakes stay strapped for your sake
It’s hard to maintain, it's even harder stayin' sane
With all this fuck shit in my life
Fuck shit in my life
With all this fuck shit in my life
Fuck shit in my life

[Verse 1]
I put out all the fuck shit, fuck niggas, broke hoes, amphetamines
Including the bottom feeders, all the snakes and centipedes
Thats why I beat up the beat and I never let it breathe
Ain't no mercy for the verse, fuckin' let it weep
I'm just another petty thief, never had the spaghetti feast
Mind frame, godfather of the Genovese
Play the game raw, you lookin like a kilo was an 8Ball
To me you was a paint job
Ain't shit without my home boys
Share guns and yell die all in one voice
I'm a motherfuckin' slider, not bein' modest
My bitch a goddess
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't no V, ain't no love
Ain't no show, ain't no nothin'
Ain't no real niggas no more
Too many fuck niggas gettin' money
All the dope look processed, but don't get dropped yet
To the gym, kid again, yeah but that can't stop shit
All this fuck shit in my life, I gon' get that shit right
Where I'm a put all these damn choppers
Where I'm gon' set up another trap
Went and bought a bunch of chickens...
Fuck the niggas in the front, If we the niggas in the back
In my good love buzzard I've been fuckin' up money
Now I'm right back tryin' to turn a little nothin' into somethin'
I'm prayed up till the day I'm straight up
So hope u s-t-r-a-p-p-e-d, bitch I'm AK'ed up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All this fuck shit, fuck niggas, fuck the rules
Fuck these bitches
If they ain't fuckin', fuck 'em, I'm fuckin' rude
Fuck these niggas
If ain't fuckin' eatin' I'm fuckin' schemin'
Realer than me? get out of here, you're fuckin' dreamin'
Fuck you expect to get
Fuck you want for it
JOB means just over broke and I need more money
Roll money, fuck on the floor money, tall money
But all means cause even when you die it's gonna cost money
I treat, went out and live I make that call
Paid my dues, played my part
Paid with your motherfuckin' shot jaws
Fuck your blog, fuck your opinion, I live this shit
Everybody tough in their own hood, I'm tough everywhere

[Hook]
