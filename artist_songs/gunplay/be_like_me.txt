[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I just stepped out the car, all they see is the gold
All I'm sellin' is dope but they think it's my soul
As I step on the corner, they wanna be like me
Watch how I move, I got degrees on my feet
Shoes on the whip, got the tints on the car
Got the .40 on my hip, bad bitch, I'm not a star
Chopper in the trunk, I got a chopper in the trunk
Chopper in the trunk, I got a chopper in the trunk
Once a nigga use it then you know you gotta throw it
Snakes in the grass, motherfucker I'mma mow it
Problems, I'ma don, put in all my effort
Spend a couple dollars nigga, blocka-blocka-blocka
Gunnin' for the throne, yeah boy, you want my crown
Michael Buffet account, Pacquiao, you're going down

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Wanna see a dead body, see a dead body?
Wanna see a dead body, see a dead body?
I'll show it to ya nigga, wanna see a dead body?
Teflon Don, Bon Jovi, John Gotti

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Step on the block, they wanna be like me
Look at his watch, he wanna be like me
Step on the corner, they wanna be like me
I fear no man, it's time to move this key
I put my eye to the scope, never missin' a shot
Shoot for the stars, I'mma rip up your top
Step out the car, all they see is the gold
All I'm sellin' is dope but they think it's my soul

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
So who they wanna be like? Me, that's right, Gunplay
A player that'll take it to the paint without a pump fake
Comin' through the janky bitch shootin' me the fuck face
I ain't sparin' bitches round this bitch, ain't nothin' safe
You know what I'm bout, I'm bout that motherfuckin' action
Lock a loose pit out the gate, broke the latches
Got a $1000 blunt, smoke it til there ain't no ashes
Keep the choppers in my trunk and Bibles on my dashes
Who wanna boot it for me? You don't wanna do that homie
Cause I got a heater with the motherfuckin' cooler on it
Leave a nigga icy in the middle of the summer
Middle of that dice game, tryna roll his number
You talking crazy but me and you know
I take it down like I been here before
I go OD like someone tripled the dose
Screechin on me, loaded clip with some dope

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Step on the block, they wanna be like me
Look at his watch, he wanna be like me
Step on the corner, they wanna be like me
I fear no man, it's time to move this key
I put my eye to the scope, never missin' a shot
Shoot for the stars, I'mma rip up your top
Step out the car, all they see is the gold
All I'm sellin' is dope but they think it's my soul

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
When I step out the 'Vert bitches jump out they skirt
They know what money look like and what a real nigga worth
Gettin' money everyday, not just 15th and the 1st
I whip out my dick, hoes quenchin' they thirst
I be tourin' with a warrant, spillin' Bel-Aire when I pour it
Hoes not allowed to speak english in my foreign
You don't get your issue when you fuckin' with the don
Logan and the loaded rifle that I'm holdin' long
They don't want this pressure, they don't want this pressure
Six pistols sittin' by my brick compressor
Dirty as my draws is (bum-bum-bum-bum-bum)
Knockin' pictures off the walls bitch (hundred in the drum)
Niggas on that Flocka, shootin' grannies off of rockers
Knockin' meat up off of tacos like blocka-blocka-blocka
I be whippin' the rock, you be trippin' on thots
I jump up out the drop like coke out the pot

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Step on the block, they wanna be like me
Look at his watch, he wanna be like me
Step on the corner, they wanna be like me
I fear no man, it's time to move this key
I put my eye to the scope, never missin' a shot
Shoot for the stars, I'mma rip up your top
Step out the car, all they see is the gold
All I'm sellin' is dope but they think it's my soul

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Wanna see a dead body, see a dead body?
Wanna see a dead body, see a dead body?
I'll show it to ya nigga, wanna see a dead body?
Teflon Don, Bon Jovi, John Gotti

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Step out the car, all they see is the gold
All I'm sellin' is dope but they think it's my soul
But they think it's my soul
But they think it's my soul
