[Hook:]
They not knowin' (they not) [x3]
They finna learn shit the hard way

They don't know nothin' (they don't) [x3]
They finna learn shit the hard way

[Verse:]
Big chain my neck hurt Big watch my wrist hurt
Hoes gone went bizzurk a walking blizzard
Beef is just dessert my work never scissored
My shit be white whiter than a grand wizard
My position went from petty to big fete already
Rapin' that white lady golden girl white betty
Ain't steppin' on that ho don't wanna get that white dirty
G-A-N-G-S-T-A and that's for certain
I got me a conan? 2 G's for 2000 throwbacks
Got money power fame now where the hoes at?
She tryna ride but she askin' where the does at?
I see ya tryna get money this is where the most at
Get high compulsive can't keep my composure
Tattoos on my osa heart blacker than vulture?
I just wanna fuck that's what my hoes for
I am a shock to the whole human culture
I run the asphalt here come the bath-salt
Cut the B.S. with a gindogen hacksaw
2LM jack boy fuck all that rap talk
I leave yo whip with one wheel like a catwalk
Nigga? what my name is that's why I came here
And I came with a heron hurricane here
Short stop no prob won't ask if I could slang here
We toastin' votes in I'm a do my thang here
This kid from skid row dirty hat brim low
Lookin' like criminal chief like seminal
If they don't let them know I brung extra extendos
My charges used to let the public defend those
Comprendo compadre middle finger in ya madre
While I pull a benz up to the guard gate
Broad day off safety in ya hallway
I guess they gotta learn shit the hard way

[Hook:]
They not knowin' (they not) [x3]
They finna learn shit the hard way

They don't know nothin' (they don't) [x3]
They finna learn shit the hard way
