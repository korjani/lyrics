[Hook 1: Gunplay]
She actin' like she all that, and all that, and all that
She actin' like she all that, and all that, and all that
What you tryin' to do hoe, fight or fuck
What you tryin' to do hoe, fight or fuck
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I ain't with the mind resting
I'm just tryin' to leave the mac or you might miss it
I'm a motherfucking pimp and it's a live message
I said I play the game raw what's with the fire faces
I ain't a poet and you know it I'm a eye blazer
The boujie bitches turning over like a cloud chaser
Said she's sophisticated but she looking sound basic
It's all about she high make us
And never tried maces, bitch you crazy
I'm a feed you mama luci's and offer you a luci
Take you to the fantasy motel your fantasy's come true now
Got a new batch of bad bitches I recruted
Gunplay the principal slap and there is to it
Hail to the ruler, she bowing picking up them dollars
Hail to the muler looking like Cale in the muller
More watch rock like Van Halen went through there
My pocket looking like my money grew there

[Hook 1: Gunplay]
She actin' like she all that, and all that, and all that
She actin' like she all that, and all that, and all that
What you tryin' to do hoe, fight or fuck
What you tryin' to do hoe, fight or fuck
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
She so sophisticated, so is my pimpin baby
This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga. Follow me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sipping purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Shitting on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash and my bitch so bad, she know sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain't got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)
