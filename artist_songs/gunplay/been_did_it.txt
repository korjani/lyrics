[Bridge: Gunplay]
I've been getting this money, been buggin these hoes
Been slippin off rubbers when I fucked around with no clothes
Been getting this dope but I've spent it all on my notes
Respect, power, money (uh) that's all that I know

[Verse 1:]
All I know is Rolex, all I know baguettes
All I know is the best, all I know is you scratch
All I know is Ferrari, all I know is you sorry
All I know is you wanna be me, you wish you'd trade bodies
All I know is 3 C's, all I know is 2 M's
All I know is build a bird goop, rock booku gems
All I know is these rims, all I know is these sins
All I know I've been broke and ain't been back ever since

[Hook: Ayo, Gunplay]
I've been callin the shots (I been did it)
Mirror face on my watch
Man, I've been getting this gray, ya'll niggas just opened up shop (I been did it)
I've been holding these knots, 50 racks on my arm (I been did it)
I been there, I did that
Ya'll niggas have not
I been did it, I been did it
I been did it, I been did it (Ya'll niggas have not)
I been did it, I been did it
I been did it, I been did it (Ya'll niggas have not)
I been did it

[Bridge: Gunplay]
I've been getting this money, been buggin these hoes
Been slippin off rubbers when I fucked around with no clothes
Been getting this dope but I've spent it all on my notes
Respect, power, money – that's all that I know

[Verse 2:]
All I know is this moolam my Mueller and jeweler
All I know my money long and I don't need me no ruler
All I know is the trill and how to crack seals
And how the back of a black Maybach feel
All I know is these charges – Got dropped and it's marvelous
All I know – these pussy niggas just got put on the list
All I know is this izzy, all I know is precision
All I know is this pimpin, I bet she knows the difference
