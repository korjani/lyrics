Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Daddy tell em
Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Daddy tell em

I'm the truth and that's the truth
I'm the screw that just went loose
I'm the liquor in your liver
I'm the pistol in your boot
Tell em daddy
I'm the dope that's in the spoon
And the elephant in the room
I'm the money under the table
And the one that buy the food
Tell em daddy
I'm the gift, I'm the curse
I'm the hunger, the thirst
I'm the hog in the game
And I'm the reason I'm worst
Tell em daddy
I'm the dice on the grid
I'm the ice in the grill
I'm the steak, I'm the lobster
I'm the sauce from the bib
I'm the report on the news
I'm the cork on the booze
I'm the Bugatti pedal
I'm the sole on the shoe
Tell em daddy
I'm the tape on the pack
I'm the ape on the track
I'm that nigga that you owe
Soon as I double back
Tell em daddy

Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
I'm a G, tell em daddy
Getting fee, tell em daddy
I'm a beast, tell em daddy
Off the leash, tell em daddy
Daddy tell em
Let me tell you
Daddy tell em
Let me tell you
Tell em daddy

I'm the crack in the bag
I'm the flame on the blunt
I'm the fork in the cup
I'm the microwave torching it up
Tell em daddy
I'm the rim, I'm the shine
I'm the nic', I'm the dime
I'm the leather on the seat
Where these big booties bitches sit down
Tell em daddy
I'm the blood in the vein
The breath in the lung
And the thought in the brain
I'm the link in the chain
The mink and the rain
Tell em daddy
I'm the dirty lace in the sneaker
And the bass in the speaker
I'm next
I'm the "Pyrex" printed on beakers
Tell em daddy
I'm the pimp, I'm the John
I'm the run, I'm the arm, I'm the kush
I'm the jar, I'm Bel-Aire
I'm the bar
Tell em daddy
I'm the junkie, I'm the flunkie
I'm the green, I'm the white
I'm the song, I'm the jam
I'm the shit, I'm the hype, (Aye!)
Tell em daddy

Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
I'm a G, tell em daddy
Getting fee, tell em daddy
I'm a beast, tell em daddy
Off the leash, tell em daddy
Daddy tell em
Let me tell you
Daddy tell em
Let me tell you
Tell em daddy

Hold up

Tell em daddy

I'm the perp and the charge
I'm the person at large
I'm the Remy, I'm the chevy
I'm the Hemi in the Dodge
Tell em daddy
I'm the drug I'm the dealer
I'm the Rome I'm the Miller
I'm the one I'm the winner
I put the go in gorilla
Tell em daddy
I'm the dash under bible
The magazine under rifles
The pool of the blood under rivals
The bail jumper, the lifer
Tell em daddy
I'm the ounce, I'm the key
I'm the bounce on the beat
You can ask anybody nigga, I'm MMG
Tell em daddy

Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
Let me tell you
Who the fuck I am
Tell em daddy
I'm a G, tell em daddy
Getting fee, tell em daddy
I'm a beast, tell em daddy
Off the leash, tell em daddy
