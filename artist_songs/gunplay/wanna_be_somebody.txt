[Gunplay:]
Everybody wanna be me but nobody wanna see me
That's what you choose I'm a put you on the news if you wanna be on tv
Everybody wanna be the boss but nobody wanna pay the cost
Nigga wanna ride clean somebody gotta take a loss
Gotta dummy brick if you wanna be a d-boy
Gotta full clip and a nigga won't leave one
Salute a real nigga when you see one
Count money every day like a rerun like a rerun
Everybody want heaven but nobody wanna die
Everybody wanna do dirt get caught but nobody wanna lie
Rat nigga brap brap brap nigga
Black and white paperwork the facts nigga all on yo head them stacks nigga
Everybody wanna be thug everybody wanna mean mug
All them pussy niggas pussy all them pussy niggas need hugs
But me I get it in tho my dogs and my kin folk
Just me n my mini AK lum lum lum hangin out the window

[Chorus]
