[Intro:]
I'm a work my Drake on this one...
Check me out, shout out Young Money Cash Money
And of course, Maybach Music, Triple C's - Carol City
Miss me when I'm gone, Jack - miss me when I'm gone
Everybody time gon' be up one day

[Verse:]
They call me Gunplay - (Don Logan)
Maybach black sheep - (Maybach)
Rifle longer than my rap sheet
Love skinny girls, shout out to the fat freaks
Running with the realest, try and keep up with the track team
Black Caddy, pimp daddy Mack Maine
Ugly in real life, handsome on a flat screen
More dubs than L's -
It don't matter how my stacks seem, my thought's the bills
Reputation dirty, that's the only way to word it -
Let the jury weigh the verdict - guilty or perverted
It was a semi-auto, now it's fully converted
When money and fame came, the loyalty got murdered - (damn)
Toes flashy, she my baby for life
She rollin', I'm rollin' and we ain't even shake dice
Little titties, big ass, cute face shaped nice
Every stone on read as double, praise Christ
I'm walking on water, hover over Florida -
Taking my corner back, rap Tracy Porter
Custom cars and cycles on them, that was just a warm-up
Color cut clarity gon' kill them while they on it
King James on my dashboard, they brought Lebron in
Skyping with your wifey, thank God for electronics
Gunplay, gun charge? - Ironic
Walk slower out here but I run it - (Don Logan)

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah girl, it's on - you know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah, I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for -
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
