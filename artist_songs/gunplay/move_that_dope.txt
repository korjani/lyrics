[Hook x2 - Future:]
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, Aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope

[Verse 1 - Gunplay:]
Belaire, D'usse, don't care what you say
I be bombing on drama like Saddam Hussein
Big body black Benz hogging two lanes
Big, lack heat hot as two blue flames
Young nigga move that dope
Nigga, move that hard, nigga, move that soft
Nigga, move that raw, nigga, get that off
Pushers be pushing, dealers be slanging
Banana clip on the bottom of the stick hanging
And I'm riding with that thing too, show you what my name do
Took a rough left quicker than I came through
Living legend in the kitchen chefing
While the sunlight bouncing off my wrist and Chevy
Thug nigga, drug dealer, none realer, they just rebels
I'm the entrée, main course, they just samples
Two dice, three dice, major gambles
Woodgrain in the whip like it came with campers

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pharrell:]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
Young nigga move that dope [?] move that ho
When I move that rope I can move your ho
When she hit a motherfucking note from her throat
When I sing la, la, la on Ferrari
Red on red light, the imperial army
Mami, I am sorry, that was just my ego on me
Women's my army, surrounded, they always be on me
Just want that peace like they Ghandi
Close my eyes, pray to the omnificent
Just to wake up the insomniacs
Let me help you lift your shit
Hit it right and ignite your shit
See it, build it, sell it, IPO, but don't swipe your shit

[Hook]
