Toby was alive and feelin' free
Cutin' loose to see what he could see
Searchin' for a friend to share my time
Lookin' for a mountin I can climb
Ain't afraid of death or no voodoo
Do the best that I can do

With the spirit of the wild runnin' free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me,Yea

Angry at the state of world affairs
Angry at the fools that just don't care
This is guaranteed to go no where
Even like a dog, that's been abused
I will never ever loose

With the spirit of the wild inside of me
I got the spirit of the wild runnin' free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, Yea!

Got the spirit of the wild yea!

Won't believe the lie that time will tell
Gonna tell the world to go to the

Spirit of the wild is runnin' free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me, Yea, YEA!
Spirit of the wild, is runnin' free, I got the spirit of the wild
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me,oh yea
Can you feel it, Can you feel it,got the spirit, of the wild
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me,oh
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Spirit of the wild, of the wild
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
