I need you, baby
Like a dog needs a bone
I need you, baby
Like a man needs a home

I need you, baby
Like a cloud needs a rain
But I've got to have you
Cause you drove me insane

[CHORUS]
Well, you can yank me
And you can crank me
But don't you wake up
And don't you try to thank me

I need you, baby
Like a dog needs a bone
I think I got one of my own

I like your legs
They're soft to the touch
Wrapped around me
I like it so much

I need you, baby
And a couple your friends
I'll bring em round
And we can do it again

[CHORUS]
You're wasting my time

[CHORUS]

I said, I need you, baby
Like this dog needs a bone
I need you, baby
Like some man needs a home

I like your legs
They feel so soft to the touch
Wrap em round my face, baby
I think I dig it so much

Well, you can yank me
I said, crank me
But don't you waste my time
I don't want you woken up
Just so you can thank me

[CHORUS 3X]
