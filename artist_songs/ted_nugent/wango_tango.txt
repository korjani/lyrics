A rock 'n' roll sensation
Yeah I like it baby, I do it every night
I got to do it 'cos I like it so much
Oh honey believe it baby
You see it's a crazed gyration of the rock generation
It's my motivation to avoid the nauseation, frustration
When I need some lubrication - Baby!

You take her right ankle out
You take her left ankle out
You get her belly propped down
You get her butt propped up

Now what you gotta do, I'll tell you what you gotta do
You got to pretend your face is a Maserati
It's a Maserati

It's a fast one too man, that thing's turbocharged
You feel like a little fuel injection honey?

I'll check out the hood scoop
I gotta get that hood scoop off, shine and shine and buff
I gotta buff it up, buff it up, buff it up, buff it up, buff it up,
Yeah, shiny now baby, heh heh heh
You've been drivin' all night long
It's time to put the old Maserati away
So you look for a garage, you think you see a garage
Wait a minute, Hey!, there's one up ahead
And the damn thing's open
Hello!  Get in there!
