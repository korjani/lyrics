Ooh, snakeskin cowboys
Who the hell you think you are
You're dancin' around with your high-heeled boots
Don't think that should get you far
Just hangin' around with your fancy pants on 
Aint got nothin' on me
Thinking you got it right here on the stage
Stick around boys, maybe I can set you free

Snakeskin cowboys
Who the hell you think you are
You're dancing around with your best pants on
Don't think that should get too far
Just hangin' 'round with your high-heeled sneakers and 
Dancin' all 'round the stage
Well, stick around boys I got some news
I'm gonna set you, I'm gonna set you free

Snakeskin cowboys
Who the hell you think you are
You're prancin' around with your high-heeled boots
Don't think that should get too far, no-o

Snakeskin fly-byes
Who the hell you think you are

Just hangin' 'round with your fancy pants on 
Aint got-a nothin' on me
Thinkin' you have a right, here on my stage 
Stick around boys, maybe I can set you free

Snakeskin cowboys 
Who the hell you think you are
Just strutting around with your fancy hairdos
I know you'd like to be a star no-no

Snakeskin cowboys 
Who the hell you think you are
Dancing around with your high-heeled boots 
Don't think that should get too far

Oh, snakeskin fly-byes 
Who the hell you think you are
Just dancin' around with your best pants on 
Aint gonna get too far

Oh, snakeskin cowboys
