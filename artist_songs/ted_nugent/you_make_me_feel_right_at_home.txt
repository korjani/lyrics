Cruisin' down the highway of life so long
You barely remember my name
Something you do brings me back to life
I can barely feel the pain

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Another night, another town ahead
I'm on that road again
That something you do brings me back to life
It's so good to have a friend

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Because of that I'll never leave you alone

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Cruisin' down the highway of life so long
You barely remember my name
Something you do brings me back to life
It's so good to have a friend

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home

Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
