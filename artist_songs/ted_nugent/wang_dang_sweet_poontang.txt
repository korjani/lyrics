(Wang dang sweet poontang)

That Nadine, what a teenage queen
She lookin' so clean, especi'lly down in between
What I like 
She come to town, she be foolin' around
A-puttin' me down as a rock-and-roll clown
It's all right 

(Wang dang sweet poontang)
(Wang dang sweet poontang)

Wang dang, what a sweet poontang
A-shakin' my thang as a rang-a-dang-dang in the bell
Ooh, baby
She's so sweet when she yanks on my meat 
Down on the street you know she can't be beat
What the hell 

(Wang dang sweet poontang)
(Wang dang sweet poontang)

All right, baby
You see what I got here in my hands
I got it right in my hands
Just for you, baby
I think I'm gonna yank on it one time
Look out!

Wang dang, what a sweet poontang
A-shakin' my thang as a rang-a-dang-dang in the bell

She's so sweet when she yanks on my meat 
Down on the street you know she can't be beat
What the hell
