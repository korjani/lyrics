Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?
I said hey now, baby
Where you been all my life?
Well, I'm searching all over
Still ain't found me no wife
I said, I'm searching all over
Still ain't found me no wife

Oh, you naked women, running 'round in my head
I said, all you naked women, running 'round in my head
Lord, you'll just have to be there
Till I'm buried and dead
I said, Lord you'll just have to be there
Till I'm buried and dead

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?
I've been searching all over
Still ain't found me no wife

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?
I've been searching all over
Still ain't found me no wife

I said hey, baby
Where you been all my life?

I said hey, baby
Where you been all my life?

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?

Hey, baby
Where you been all my life?
