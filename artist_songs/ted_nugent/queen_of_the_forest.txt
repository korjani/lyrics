Do you remember her name
She's standing for a long long time
She's got the magic wand
To make it rain or sunshine

She's got the power to turn out the light
She's got he power over day and the night, oh yeah

You mess up when she's angry
Cause she can level your town
When she throws a temper-tantrum
It's like the sky is falling down

She's got the power to turn out the light
She's got the power over day and the night, oh yeah

She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
Queen of the forest

She's the queen of the forest

She takes care of the creatures
She supplies all of their needs
With her they have a much better chance now
To stay happy and free

She got the power to turn out the light
She got the power over day and the night, oh yeah

She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
Queen of the forest 

The queen of the forest
She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
