Musta been the way that you touched me 
Coulda been the way that you looked 
Musta been the way that you loved me 
Coulda been the way that you shook 

But I need you, need you bad yes I need you, need you bad 
I'm in pain when your not around me 
I'm in pain when I'm not around you and I need you, need you bad 

Musta been a true desperation 
Couldn't put a feeling aside 
Maybe I was just getting horny 
It's a feelin that I just cant hide
