In the early morning hours there's a din in the air; 
mayhem's on the loose. 
Stormtroopers comin', and you better be prepared. 
Got no time to choose. 

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'. 

Comin' up that street, jackboots steppin' high. 
Got to make a stand. 
Looking in your windows and listen to your phone. 
Keep a gun in your hand. 

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'. 
Get ready. Stormtroopres comin' around. 

Two hundred down, and it's comin' 'round again. 
Got no second choice. 
Where's the justice and where's that law. 
Raise your healthy voice. 

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'. 
We'll be ready. Stormtroopers comin'. 
Getting ready. Stormtroopers comin'. 
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'.
