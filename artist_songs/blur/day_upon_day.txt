Waiting on this empty day
It's just the same as any day
And although I've nothing to say
I'm going to say it anyway

Day, day upon day, day upon day
Day upon day

Everybodies here with me
We're in the smallest room you see
And although we've nothing to do
We've got to do it adieu adieu

Day, day upon day, day upon
Day upon day
