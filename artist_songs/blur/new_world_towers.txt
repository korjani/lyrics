Green, green, the neon green
New world towers
Carved out of grey white skies
Twenty four hours
I glide through the glass arcade to Hollywood
The cycle path it leaves me dreaming of

Love, love, so far away
New world Towers
Logging your name and pray
Twenty four hours
Green turns to red and blue
And time relates
To us all again
And see the rescue

Green, green, the neon green
New world towers
Plane flying overhead
Satellite showers
Falls like confetti on the cavalcade
The flashboat sea
No longer is
Reflecting in you

Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on a left hand side
Seven on me
(Seven on me)
(Seven on me)

Love, love, so far away
New world towers
Carved out of grey white sky
Twenty four hours
Green turns to red and blue
And time relates
The flashboat sea
No longer is
Reflecting in you

Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on a left hand side
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on the left hand side
Seven on me
