You're taking the fun
Out of everything
Making me run
When I don't want to think
You're taking the fun
Out of everything
I don't want to think at all

[Chorus]
There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do
Is watch them play

You're taking the fun
Out of everything
You're making it clear
When I don't want to think
You're taking me up
When I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all

[repeat chorus]
