I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is 
No

[chorus]
Woo-hoo
When I feel heavy-metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[repeat chorus]

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
