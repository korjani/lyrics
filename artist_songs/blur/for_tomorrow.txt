HE'S A TWENTIETH CENTURY BOY, WITH HIS HANDS ON THE RAILS
TRYTNG NOT TO BE SICK AGAIN AND HOLDING ON FOR TOMORROW
LONDON ICE CRACKS ON A SEAMLESS LINE, HE'S HANGING ON FOR DEAR
LIFE
SO WE HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHTLY AND HOLD ON FOR TOMORROW.

[CHORUS]
SINGING LA LA LA LA LA
HOLDING ON FOR TOMORROW

SHE'S A TWENTIETH CENTURY GIRL, WITH HER HANDS ON THE WHEEL
TRYING NOT TO MAKE HIM SICK AGAIN, SEEING WHAT SHE CAN BORROW
LONDON'S SO NICE BACK IN YOUR SEAMLESS RHYMES, BUT WE'RE LOST ON
THE WESTWAY
SO WE HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHTLY AND HOLD ON FOR TOMORROW

[CHORUS]

[MIDDLE]

TRYING NOT TO BE SICK AGAIN AND HOLDING ON FOR TOMORROW.

SHE'S A TWENTIETH CENTURY GIRL HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE
SO WE HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHTLY AND HOLD ON FOR TOMORROW

[CHORUS]

(JIM STOPS AND GETS OU THE CAR, GOES TO A HOUSE IN EMPERORS GATE,
THROUGH THE DOOR AND TO HIS RROM, THEN HE PUTS THE TV ON, TURNS
IT OFF AND MAKES SOME TEA, SAYS MODERN LIFE IT'S RUBBISH, THEN
SUSAN COMES INTO THE ROOM, SHE'S A NAUGHT GIRL WITH A LOVELY
SMILE AND SAYS LET'S TAKE A DRIVE TO PRIMROSE HILL IT'S WINDY
THERE AND THE VIEW IS SO NICE, LONDON ICE CAN FREEZE YOUR TOES
LIKE ANYONE I SUPPOSE)

HOLDING ON FOR TOMORROW
