All those dirty words
They make us look so dumb
Been drinking far too much
And neither of us mean what we say

[Chorus]
WELL YOU AND I
COLLAPSED IN LOVE
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE MADE IT, YES IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
MADE IT TO THE END

What happened to us
Soon it will be gone forever
Infatuated only with ourselves
And neither of us can think straight anymore

[Chorus x 2]
