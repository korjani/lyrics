Streets like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday 
Love in the 90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances looking for

[Chorus:]
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work
Because there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
Get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schön
But we haven't been introduced

[Chorus]
