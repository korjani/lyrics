A FERVORED IMAGE OF ANOTHER WORLD
IS NOTHING IN PARICULAR NOW
AND IMITATION COMES NATURALLY
BUT I NEVER REALLY STOP TO THINK HOW
AND EVERYONEIS A CLEVER CLONE
A CHROME COVERED CLONE AMI
SO IN THE ABSENCE OF A WAY OF LIFE
JUST REPEAT THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

[CHORUS]
HEY HEY COME OUT TONIGHT
HEY HEY COME OUT TONIGHT
POPSCENE
ALRIGHT

I'M LEAVING TOWN TO RUN AWAY
RUN INTO YOUR TWISTED ARMS
NO QUEUES AND THERE'S NO PANIC THERE
JUST DANGLING MY FEET IN THE GRASS
MY LACK OF NATURAL LUSTRE NOW
SEEMS TO BE LOOSING ME FRIENDS
SO IN THE ABSENCE OF A WAY OF LIFE
I'LL REPEAT THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

[CHORUS]
