Sitting in a SDT
Waiting for an underground trail
To rumble underneath my feet
Bang goes another day
Where it went I could not say
Now I'll have to wait another week
Where all is said and all is done
What was said was never done
Don't panic
It's not really worth your while
Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear 
Everybody's doing it so do it too

[Chorus (x2):]
I don't need anyone
But a little love
Would make things better

Sitting on the early bus
Passing through the morning rush
It makes no difference
That I'm not with you
Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it
I'll do it too

[Repeat chorus]
