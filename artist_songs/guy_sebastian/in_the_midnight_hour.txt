I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am
Ooh yes I am
One more thing I just want to say right here

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine
You're the only girl I know
That can really love me so
In the midnight hour
Oh yeah ..In the midnight hour
Yeah, alright, play it for me one time

I'm gonna wait till midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait, way in the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
Just you and I...Ooh Baby
Just you and I 
Nobody around baby, Just, you and I
I'm gonna hold you, In my arms
