Darkness is breaking, the windows are shaking
It has begun, our time has come
Come closer to me let me feel your heart beat, baby
Chest to chest, no time to rest
Like there's an asteroid approaching, it's approaching
The clock is ticking, and I'm leaving nothing unsaid, nothing undone, nothing untouched

So tonight I'm gonna love ya like it's the last day on earth
It's the last time I'll get to show you all that you're worth
Like there's no going back, before the sky turns to black
I'm gonna love you so there's no regrettin'
Like it's Armageddon

This building may crumble but under the rubble there they will find us intertwined
As there's an asteroid approaching, it's approaching
The clock is ticking, and I'm leaving nothing unsaid, nothing undone, nothing untouched

Tonight I'm gonna love ya like it's the last day on earth
It's the last time I'll get to show you all that you're worth
Like there's no going back, before the sky turns to black
I'm gonna love you so there's no regrettin'
Like it's Armageddon

There's a million things to do but I only wanna be with you
Us together, nothing better, you're all I have to lose
So if this is our final hour,
I'll show you without a doubt how strong, how deep my love can go

So tonight I'm gonna love you like it's the last day on the earth
It's the last time I'll get to show you all that you're worth
Like there's no going back, before the sky turns to black
I'm gonna love you so there's no regrettin'
Like it's Armageddon
Oh, Armageddon
I'm gonna love you so there's no regrettin'
Like it's Armageddon
