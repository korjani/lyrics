I remember how it burns, how it burns
Slowly like a cigarette
It’s like water in my lungs, in my lungs
‘Cause I’m drowning in my regret
Everyday is getting worse like a curse
I’m becoming insomniac
And I just can’t get over it

If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

These memories are like a stain, like a stain
And it’s branded on my brain
Oh I wanna fade away, fade away
‘Cause every stranger has your face
And if I didn’t know my name, it’s ok
Girl as long as you’re erased
‘Cause I just can’t get over it

If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

Who said it’s better to have loved
Then to have never loved at all
They were wrong, they were wrong
‘Cause nothing will ever compare

If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
Wish that I could forget you, forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

I wish that I could forget you, forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia
