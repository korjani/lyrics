There's two empty glasses on the mattress
Bottle gone
In this broke down palace
We got Savage 101

We went round for round
Early morning now
Coffee in the cuff
Think we did too much
That's how we do love
Just when I want out
You remind me how
I can't get enough
I've got my mind on

Last night
'Cos I'm still feeling it
Your high is as good as it gets, oh yeah
One time can we do it again?
Want to do it again, I
I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah
I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah

All the same old issues
They continue coming back
But they go to rearview in this bedroom
Fade to black

We went round for round
Early morning now
Coffee in the cuff
Think we did too much
That's how we do love
Just when I want out
You remind me how
I can't get enough
I've got my mind on

Last night
'Cos I'm still feeling it
Your high is as good as it gets, oh yeah
One time can we do it again?
Want to do it again, I
I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah
I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah

I've got my mind on you
(Got my mind on, mind on)
I've got my mind on

Last night made my whole body trip
Can't lie with the truth on my lips
One time, can we do it again?
When we do it again, I

I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah
I've got my mind on
You
Got my mind on you, yeah

I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on
