I've been tryna lose you baby
I'm getting kinda used to failing every try
I guess we both refuse to face it
Neither one of us will ever change our stripes

Why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yea we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Linger

On and on, on and on, on and on
(Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on

So I keep the fire burning
But I'm wondering why I still can feel the cold
And I squeeze and I squeeze as hard as I can
Hoping I will get some blood out of this stone

Why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yea we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Linger

On and on, on and on, on and on
(Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on

[Lupe Fiasco:]
We'll make it last 'till the last one
Each release is just a lease that repeats the past one
Song that never ends, that was Lamb Chop
Exodus, but the sex in us is a welcome mat back to Jamrock
So even when the band stops
Guitar still playin' even though the hand's not
And all of this amounts to poltergeists and haunted houses so
Even when we die, we'll still be alive

Why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yea we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Linger

On and on, on and on, on and on
(Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on
