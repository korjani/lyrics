I've been loving you too long
to stop now

You are tired .. and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger,
as you become a habit to me
Ohh, I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now

With you my life huh
Has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

You are tired .. and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger
as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you a little too long
I don't want to stop now

ohh, ohh, ohh

I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now

ohh, ohh, ohh

And don't make me stop now
Oh baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now

I love you, I love you, I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please don't make me stop now

Talkin' 'bout heart and soul
That I love you
I love you

Good God almighty but I love you
