Is it something that I said
Never meant to be difficult
I guess I've been out of the house
By some miracle
I make it home in time
For the sun to set and rise
Heaven forbid I don't arrive
To see your face in candle light

Don't know where to start
When you see me start the car
I see it break your heart
It's tearing us apart
So I beg you baby
(So I beg you baby)

Have my phone
Have my keys
Bury me
Make so I can never leave
Slash my tires
Rip my clothes
Don't let me go
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home

Is it something that I did
Give a hint, am I terrible?
For making sure the bed that I slept isn't miserable
Just because I'm vacant
Don't mean I'm not taken
Not like I'm not staying
Still wake up to eggs and bacon

Don't know where to start
When you see me start the car
I see it break your heart
It's tearing us apart
So I beg you baby
(So I beg you baby)

Have my phone
Have my keys
Bury me
Make so I can never leave
Slash my tires
Rip my clothes
Don't let me go
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home

Lock up all the doors I don't want anybody getting through
(Keep me home)
Chain me to your body 'cos I'm dying to be close to you
(Keep me home)

Have my phone
Have my keys
Bury me
Make so I can never leave
Slash my tires
Rip my clothes
Don't let me go
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
(Yeah)
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
(Yeah)
Anything you gotta do
To keep me home
