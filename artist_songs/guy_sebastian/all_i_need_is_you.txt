You're all, you're (I know) all that I Need
You are (yeah), you're all that I Need 

I remember in the day being oh so independent
I remember how I'd say I could never fall I was cynical

Funny now in the days
Since you came into my life
Now I'll never be the same
Baby I'm amazed by the love you gave

Finally I can see
What a life really means to me, to me babe

[Chorus:]
All I need is you in my life forever
All I need is you everyday by my side
Got to let you know you're the one that I treasure
I can search the world but never find
A better love that is between you and I (I)
All I need is you (Yeah, oh, oooh, yeah, I)

When I look into your eyes
There's a feeling that I can't explain babe
That is when I realise
That all I desire is to lay by your side
Know whenever I'm alone
I wonder how I lived without you
Should've known all along
That my only world is with you in it girl

Finally I can see
What a life really means to me yeah, to me Yeah

[Chorus]

How did I find such a love so sweet
When I've only done a little right
Now I can see that it can be deserved
That the freedom that you give is mine (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus x2]

(You are, you're all that I need)
All I Need is you
(You are, you're all that I need)
Go to let you know
(You are, you're all that I need)
You're all, you're all that I need (Hey)
You are, you're all that I need
You are, you're all that I need
You are, you're all that I need
