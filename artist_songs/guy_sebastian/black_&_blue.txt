No one could hate me more than I hate myself
Cause I only blame me if you fall for someone else
I'm lost under these sheets
I'm haunted, tortured by your ghost
I couldn't be everything you wanted and that's what hurts the most

Somebody's gonna love you
Love you like I never could
When you were mine to hold
I never held you like I should
Somebody's gonna touch you
In places I could not get to
My love was not enough
And it leaves me black and blue
And it leaves me black and blue

I tried to replace you
I tried to cure my thirst
But that didn't erase you
It only made it worse

Somebody's gonna love you
Love you like I never could
When you were mine to hold
I never held you like I should
Somebody's gonna touch you
And do the things we never do
My love was not enough
And it leaves me black and blue
And it leaves me black and blue

I hope he doesn't make the same mistakes
I hope he gives more than he takes
My heart is locked in this fight with fate
I can't accept that it's too late, oh

Somebody's gonna love you
Love you like I never could
My love was not enough
And it leaves me black and blue
And it leaves me black and blue
And it leaves me black and blue
And it leaves me black...
And it leaves me black and blue
