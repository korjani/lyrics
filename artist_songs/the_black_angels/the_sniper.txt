It's quiet and loud
No one hears it but us
Some starving and proud,
No one chooses but us

You can hide up upstream,
We will trap and scalp you
Change the colour of your skin,
But sure as night we'll find you

Never meant to hurt no one,
Only meant to move myself
Yeah, I try and I try,
'til I'm red in the face

We decide what goes inside your head

You see yourself in me
How'd you do that? How'd you?
Beyond your towers wall,
He waits on the killing call
And he tries and he tries,
'til he's red in the face

We decide what goes inside your head
