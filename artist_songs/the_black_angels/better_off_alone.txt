I feel so low.

Try me out for the evening. Living in a lie.
Your figure is alarming, take me to that fire.
I'm better off alone.

Living with a lady, one who helps me to decide.
Take me to that room girl, get me through this night.
I'm better off with one.

Punish yourself on the weekend, you sneak into that bar.
Open up that box girl, all that whisky is gone.
I'm better off alone.
