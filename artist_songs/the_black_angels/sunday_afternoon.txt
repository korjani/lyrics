Come on, over here
It's all right, over here
In the silent, empty places,
It's shining, in the shadows

It's all right, over here
It's OK, over here
Up in my tree, where you can see
Crystal visions, on a Sunday

You know that you don't even know 
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You think just like they told you to
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Look within you for the Kingdom,
Then you'll see, you can see.

Come on, over here
It's all right, over here
In the middle, of the daytime,
Fell the colours, pull from inside

And come on, over here,
It's all right, over here
With your new eyes, turn on your light
Let your love glow, leave your Ego

You know that you've just got to go
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You were blind, trapped inside their sty
(Yeah yeah yeah)
But now you see that you know nothing
So just go and let it show
