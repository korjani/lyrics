Trail away, an endless day,
It happens once in your life
To be enthroned, in your home
Well, meet me by the drum
Amen

(River of blood, river of blood)
(River of blood, river of love)

Wreckin' days, you're flawless in ways,
We break for the countryside
The rebels were all shocked to find
No food or guns in those mines
You're sitting ducks (river of blood)
On this river of blood,
On this river of

Safe to stay, streams of red and grey,
It happens once in a while
A freedom chase, right next to me,
You've brought them their last wife
But, it's not enough (river of blood)
On this river of blood
On this river of

I hear footsteps coming near us
They're getting louder, I am frightened
This is it yeah, we are ready!

Superkilling rings headed for me,

If they get me

Probably be dead by tomorrow
You and I, will never know
You and I, you can know you and I
It wasn't like they told me
(I can't believe we got away)
This isn’t like they told me
In the same room,
With the same blood,
Speaking freely,
Talking has never been so easy

On this river of blood
On this river of
On this river of
