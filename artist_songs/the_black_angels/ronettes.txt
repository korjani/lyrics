See the light, inside of your cage...
Feel the power, as you try to escape...
Feel feed light, you stay away...
Similar eyes, movement and shape...

It taste like honey...
It feels so good to me...
It feels so to me...

Then came, and she brought her new dimension...
Control free, entire as she sings...

It sounds like empty...
It feels so good to me...
Feels so empty...
