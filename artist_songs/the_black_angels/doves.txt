Like one little dove,
I think you're nervous,
Prove me wrong
Well, sometimes in your life,
You spend searching,
Looking for love

You look all day
Oh, you can't sleep one time

I found you in a puddle of water, 
Open your eyes, we need you tonight
Well some, some think you're sleeping,
Prove them wrong, we need you to fly

You look all day
Oh you can't sleep on time

Like two little doves,
I'm in love
I thought you were mine
Well some, some think you're hollow,
Open your mind, we need you to fly

You look all day
Oh, you can't sleep on time
