I had a woman.
She had me too.
She was subverted.
Convincing youth.
She was so loaded,
And mesmerizing,
I had to follow
Her black horizon.

No, I will not kill for her again.
No, I will not kill for her again.

She had precision,
A perfect view.
Clear out the chambers,
Seducing youth.
It was so brutal
The way she moved.
The perfect sniper,
One hundred proof.

She took us to the killing field.

It's just a heart she's stealing.
It's just a heart she's given.
It's just a life that's taken to...
It's just a life that's taken.
It's just your life that's taken.
It's just your life that's given.

There was a city
That we all knew.
She stole its freedom
And then she flew.
A broken angel
Inside the room.
Took all the children
And then she flew.

No, I will not kill for her again.
No, I will not kill for her again.

It's just your heart she's stealing.
It's just your heart she's giving.
It's just your life she's taking to...
It's just your life she has taken.
It's just your blood that's taken.
It's just your blood that's taken.
