I don't stay after 6
Oh no, it's way to dark
"You're frightened," she said
"No one can hear us at all"

There was this thought I was sane
Until I met that red dame

"Don't be worried,"
Is all she said
"Oh baby you whine
Yeah, you cry all the time"

The bed spread is green
You talk, dress, and think
We leave before it gets dark
Walk steady with you in arms
So don't be around me,
Yeah, I'm gone you see

"In the night I roam
Hey, hey, hey"
I guess I'll pack my things

"In the night I roam
Hey, hey, hey"
"In the night I roam
Hey, hey, hey"
"In the night I roam
Hey, hey, hey"
