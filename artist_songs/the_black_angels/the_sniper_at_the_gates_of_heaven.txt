Where do you go when heaven calls you
What do you do, who do you turn to
How old will you be when they finally catch you
Don't stop moving, they're right behind
When there's no one left on this earth you know
Who can save you kid, so just wake up wake up wake up

What is it like when hell surrounds you
How hot does it get, I think I've already felt it
Is there any way out, you better find one
Where do you go, down down the (no idea)
When there's no one here in this world of truth
Who knows first hand, so just wake up wake up wake up
