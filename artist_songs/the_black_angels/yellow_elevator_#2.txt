Picture the skyline right over the sky
Picture your image right over your eye
Now you see you see it fall
Now you see you see you fall

See your friends around the temple on the street downtown,
Run forth to tell them all the truth that you've found
One by one they go up inside,
I thought that I'd been left behind too

Yellow elevator, yellow elevator,
Yellow elevator, yellow elevator

Stuck on the ground 'til
I found another way there,
Now you take a ride
On that yellow elevator

Seeing thru golden light

Pierce that ceiling with the light that you find
Try behold the spirit it can burn your eyes,
You hold the fire and catch your soul
I held the fire and I want it so, again

Yellow elevator, yellow elevator,
Yellow elevator, yellow elevator

Nothing's the same after that elevator
Nothing's the same after that yellow elevator

Seeing thru golden light

Now I can see how the seasons all repeat
And that love makes new things out of nothing that it needs
The generation born will grow from all the crimes before,
And then stack up with all the heads
That are piled outside your door

I understand that I exist in the between,
Of what was and what will be in those blurry vision scenes,
That appear but pass us by and for a moment get you high,
'til you find your way back down
Become the truth you've found
