You gave a gift to me
In my young age
You sent me overseas
And put the fear in me
And I ask what for now
Why me, why war?
And I ask what for now
Vietnam War?
Spent my time there by the shore

Oh we got off that boat
Charlies everywhere
A lotta killin' and dyin'
And no one seems to care
I ask what for now
We say hell no
And I ask what for
Why me, why war?
And I spent my time there by the shore

Sixty thousand men died
While you were here
You came into our homes
And you took our kids
And you ask for more now
For this new war
And you ask for more now
Vietnam War
I spent my time there by the shore
