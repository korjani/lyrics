Oh my my
My boat is sinking
I'm floating here
On my sacred bed
I'm drifting away
With all my belongings
What do I do to keep the sunshine in

Well I will hold you
I will help you
I'll be there when you need me
I'll be there when you don't see

Well well well
Thank you for thinking
But I just found out that my house is in flames
Now whatchyew you gunna do for me ?
Whatchyew gunna say to me ?
To keep me moving honey
To keep the sunshine in
Well I will hold you
Ya I will help you
I'll be there on your birthday honey
I'll be there when you need me
Well well well
I found out I'm dying darling
Now what do I do
To keep the sunshine in?
Now what you gunna sing to me
What you gunna do for me
To keep me moving
To keep the sunshine in
Well I will save you
Ya I will hold you
I'll be there when you need me
And I will die with you

You loosen me,
You make me feel
You loosen me
You make me feel

Ohh my my
My boat is sinking
I'm floating away on my sacred bed
I'm drowning here
With all my belongings
What do I do
To keep the sunshine in

Well I will hold you
Ya I will save you
I'll be there when you need me
I'll be there when you don't see.
