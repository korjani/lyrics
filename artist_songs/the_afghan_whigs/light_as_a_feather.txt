Say you're coming for the rest of me
Sounds good, I like what you're doing
Let me demonstrate
And though I've said it before
I'm gonna be breaking your heart, baby

Now if your limits should convince the sky
You sidle up proper, baby
You will never die
I know I've said It before
I'm gonna be breaking your heart, baby

Cross the river to get next to me­
You're like the dawn
You're either gonna let go
Or come get some more
Don't ever let go
Come get some more

Our love from mouth to mouth
My kingdom from the South
So come collect your feelings

Light as a feather, child
I got nothing to lose

O, no
These consequences
