Baby, I see you've made yourself all sick again
Didn't I do a good job of pretending
You're saying that the victim doesn't want it to end
Good, I get to dress up and play the assassin again
It's my favorite
It's got personality

I should have seen this shit coming down the hall
Every night I spent in that bed with you facing the wall
If I could have only once heard you scream
To feel you were alive
Instead of watching you abandoning yourself

Baby, you can open your eyes now
And please allow me to present you with a clue
If I inflict the pain
Then baby only I can comfort you, yeah

Out of the night we come
And into the night we go
If it starts to hurt you
Then you have to say so

Out of the night we come
And into the night we go
If it starts to hurt you
Then you have to say so

Out of the night we come
And into the night we go
If it starts to hurt you
Then you have to say so
