Now that the blood has begun
I'd like to see how it's done
Behind my back, up to my face,
Let's take the money and run

Before you go for that, son,
You better think about luck
While you're debating, I'll be waiting
For the sound of a bomb

If my desire for your company
Made this motherfucker point his gun at me
Every complication, every little crime that you hide
I will find if you ever do change your mind

I'm over you, I'll tell you why
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with me

They say that fate is a card
And that the sun is a star
I'm throwin' shade, we got it made
I think I'll have a cigar
I got a number for it
There ain't no way it can fit
I'm so excited you decided
To come over and beg

I'm over you, I'll tell you why.
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with me

Baby, I'm over you, I'll tell you why
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with me
