Hey cuz, hey cuz, hey cuz
How you doing, how's it hanging
Don't leave me hanging, I can't be
I'm talking down to you now, and I said
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong
Oh nothing's wrong, my lips are cracked I've been
Smiling all day long
My red eyes are shining
Attention your blinding

Hey cuz, I'm holding
Who wants to get high
Come to you crawling
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry

What's up, what's up, what's up
What's up,
Don't be holding out on me
I come to you when you're sleeping tonight
My red eyes are shot

Hey cuz, I'm holding
Who wants to get high
Come to me crawling
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry

When I see your red eyes
I go out of my mind

Not enough [x8]

Hey cuz, I'm calling
Who wants to get high
Come to me holding
Hey cuz can you cry, cry, cry
