Over and over I get to know myself.
Over and over there ain't nobody else
Imperceptible the lines I draw to you.
It kills to watch you love another.

I should have known better
when I caught you wild;
you were incredible.
Never knew you like I know you now.
You are illegible
Imperceptible the lines that form the screw.
It kills to watch you love another.

Over and over I get to know myself.
Over and over there ain't nobody else
A receptacle of lies, construed to waste your time.
It kills to watch you love another.

Over and over I get to know myself.
Over and over there ain't nobody else
A receptacle, the lies construed to waste your time.
It kills to watch you love another.
It kills to watch you love another.
It kills to watch you love another.
