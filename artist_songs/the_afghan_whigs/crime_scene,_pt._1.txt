Tonight, tonight, I say goodbye
To everyone who loves me
Stick it to my enemies tonight
Then I disappear

Bathe my path in shining light
Set the dials to thrill me
Every secret has its price
This one's set to kill

Too loose, too tight
Too dark, too bright
A lie, the truth
Which one should I use?
If the lie succeeds
Then you'll know what I mean
When I tell you I have tecrets to attend 

Do you think I'm beautiful?
Or do you think I'm evil?
Will you take me for a ride?
The one that never ends? 

Too loose, too tight
Too dark, too bright
A lie, the truth
Which one shall I use?
If the lie succeeds
Then you'll know what I mean
When I tell you I have secrets to attend

Tonight, tonight, I say goodbye
To everything that thrills me
As I throw the chains
I forged in life
To shatter on the floor

As I dream, all the evidence
Is piling up against me
As I breathe all the essence rare
Is falling off the vine
And if you knew, just how smooth
I could stop it on the dime
You could meet me at the
Scene of the crime
