So what you make me hard
If I was harder now I would crack into a million things
Things I didn't really need
But how I wanted so
What a nice dream
Didn't want to wake up
So I kept it dark all the time
Dark enough so not to see
But not as dark as the plans that you have for me
So what you made me smile
I had smiled at lesser things before I ever thought of you
Before I thought my soul was mine
Now I think about me only when I can find the time
Flowers all around
Put your lover in the ground
Flowers everywhere yeah yeah yeah
Nowhere you can be found
I have put you in the ground
Nowhere is everywhere
For you my flower
Better get myself a drink
Better get a couple so I can look you straight in the face
Tell you that I think of you
Almost as much as you think of you
