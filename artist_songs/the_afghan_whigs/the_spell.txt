It was sabotage until
Dream transcended purpose
In time the revelator comes for thee

Who cut the demons down?
Laid bare to show you how
One comes a distant memory

Play dead for a moment, child

I wanna go deep down
To where my soul lets go
And take my fantasy
And lay it on the table
And are you gonna see the light?
Or are you gonna be the light?
I wanna free the light
And lose control
And lose control

Here come flat top candy cane
He come slithering down again
If I'm on fire
Then you best follow me home

If black is invisible, baby
And fact indivisible, baby
Be the light
O, lord
Free the light
O, lord

Day not wasted
Dream not tasted
There's no faking lust this time

Be the light
Free the light

And so it goes
And so it goes
