Start the car
Check the mirror
Shut the door
Slap the gear
We leave tonight, ain't nothing but the stripes
Ain't nothing but the stripes

See the light, be the night, feel the road
River rise, synchronize, bleed some more
We leave tonight
We leave tonight

If I'm uncivilized child, that's okay
You're gonna see me light a fire on my days
But you don't see me
You don't see me
You don't see me
I can't see you anymore

If all in vain I call your name as though the end was near
A slow decay, a sad refrain, and then I disappear
We leave tonight
Ain't nothing but the stripes

As those city lights die, I'm on my way
You're gonna see me light a fire on my days
But you don't need me
You don't need me
You don't need me
I don't need you anymore
