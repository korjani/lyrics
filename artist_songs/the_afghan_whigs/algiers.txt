Faith, the diamond in the chain
Still I was a slave, waiting to be saved
Dream, the body sleeps but I
Am not too proud to roam
On the back streets
It's oh, so simple when you know
You'll know this when it's time to go

Stray, and soon you'll leave behind
The loneliness you've sown, paradise leans
Scream, the body leaves the bone
To sit upon the throne
The battle waged for light

Dream, dream your sins away
Sin your dreams away
You're holding back, stop holding back
Unchain!

Say you'll love me tonight
Save your love for me tonight
And I feel you now
Lie awake and love drunk
I feel you now

Heavenly daemons outside my window
Sent here to see me outside this world
I call the shadow, you call the season
And that's solitary
