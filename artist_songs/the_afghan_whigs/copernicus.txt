Naked but for tears
While the sky falls down
Panting for the rush
Hissing thru the crowd

Waving at the wheels
But I can't slow down
I'm riding, riding thru your town

So say what you got to say
Play, but you got to pay

Heavy is the head
But you wear no crown
Hang it in the sky
And step inside your dream

I know what I know
And with the lights down low
I'm riding, riding down your street

So say what you got to say
Play, but you got to pay

She went to California
Painted in light
Til all the colors ran­
Wild

You came to mesmerize her
She came with consequences in her eyes
In her eyes
Deep in her eyes

Listen in the the distance
As the sky begins to fall
Raining down like crystalline
Apocalypse in thrall
Rolling under
Torn asunder
Blinded by it all

Once there was a way­
Then you were gone
