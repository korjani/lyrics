Nightime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
And dressing so sweet, all the people to see
They're looking at me, all the people to see

When I set my eyes on you
You look like a kitty
And when you're in the moon
Oh, you look so pretty

Caught a glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies
Glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies

Walking down the freezing street
Scarf goes out behind
You said get them away
Please, don't say a word

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
I hate it here
Get me out of here

Nightime, I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and on my way
Nightime, I go out and see the people

Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
