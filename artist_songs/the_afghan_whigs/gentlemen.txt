Your attention please
Now turn off the light
Your infection please
I haven't got all night

Understand
Do you understand?
Understand
I'm a gentleman

I stayed in too long
But she was the perfect fit
And we dragged it out so long this time
Started to make each other sick

But now I've got time for you
For you, you, you and you and me too
Well, come and get it, come and get it
Cause I'm done

Understand
Do you understand?
Understand, I'm a gentleman
I'm a gentleman

I waited for the joke
It never did arrive
And words I thought I'd smoke

Let me in I'm cold
All messed up but nowhere to go
You got indecision, and indecision is my enemy
Well, unlock the cabinet, hey
I'll take whatever you got, got, got
Now I'm on it, now I'm on it
And you're done

I waited for the joke
It never did arrive
And words I thought I'd choke
I hardly recognize
