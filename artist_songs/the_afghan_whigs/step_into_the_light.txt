Whenever the light shines
And the stillness is shaken
And the drug of your smile has gone
And left me alone

I need it bad, I need it now
Won't you come and give me some?
I need it sweet, baby please
Won't you answer the phone?

Step into the light, baby
Just give me the word and I will begin
Step into the light, baby
And see the trouble I'm in

The light has gone
My love has gone
The good times have gone
Away

I have to ask, I need to know
Was it ever love?
I need it sweet, baby please
Won't you come and give me some

Step into the light, baby
Just give me the word and I will begin
Step into the light, baby
And see the trouble I'm in, I'm in
