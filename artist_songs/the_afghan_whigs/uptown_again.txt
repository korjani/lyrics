Uptown again
Nobody home
Feelin' surrounded
Should never left me on my own

Remember nothing, hypnotize
They say the eyes they never lie
Your eyes have failed you dear, deny
Deny, deny I know you'll try

Baby, untie me now
I'm ready to get down
Get down and move around
Baby, you cry too much
I'm tired of the sound
You're such a baby

Uptown again
Throw me a bone
Feelin' surrounded
I've never done so well alone

Baby, untie me now
I'm ready to get down
Get down and move around
Baby, you cry too much
I'm tired of the sound
You're such a baby

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
