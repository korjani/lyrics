I know you're sleeping with another demon
Love destroyed by love
And I know you couldn't care because we're legion
Love demeaned by love
This all night or get it right
Loaded to the teeth
Once a malady, since a rhapsody
Love thy neighbor, love thy neighbor

Bow down or kill the crown
The royal cream is love diseased by love
Come back, you dirty rat, behold the dreamer
Love believed by love
This all night or get it right
Rolling through the reeds
This apology kills a part of me
Love thy stranger, love thy stranger

If I would become what I dreamed as a child
I'd be fearless, devoted, alive

Jump back or kiss the Jack
This lowlife's feeling low
Run now or take a bite
You'll only hear this once

I know you're sleeping with another demon
Love destroyed by love
Come back, you dirty rat, behold the schemer
Love deceived by love, deceived by love
If I have a breath inside of me
I'll drink the blood of royalty
They're running
They're running
They're running, oh
