I'm the chosen one
I'm the setting sun
Hottest car on the block
Faster than you'll take me

Picture where I've been
Underneath within
I could love you, I could steal your light
Day conjoined with night
And I could hide away
I'd see you through, I'd see you through

Take me there if you're coming
What to wear? Where you going?
What would you like for me to know?
And would you die to tell me so?
You said recovery is slim...
I could complicate it
I could recreate it
My only cover was a con

Succinctly,
Distinctly,
Completely knew

And this is where it's gone
And this is why we came
As long as we're apart, the game is not the same
I see you eternal
I'm burning encircled
If day can turn to night
Then I could ride away
