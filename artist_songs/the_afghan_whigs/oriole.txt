Light the candle
Lock the door, too
Draw the circle
I'll fall into you

Divination
Cleromancy
Comes the card that
I refused to see

The was a violence In my head
I was surrounded In my bed
And from a slender perch
I vowed that I would fly forever

Flying
Flying
Flying

Thru love I wander
Seek my thunder
Slip my number
Undercover
Free at last
Cage burned
Cages burn
So true, unglued
Where and when no matter
I will find you
Until then
Hang on, hang on
So true, unglued
Where and when no matter
I will find you
