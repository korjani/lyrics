White light
Conceit
If I saw what you say that you see in me

Allez
My Love

Too late
My lie
Had been cast to the dark side of
Do or die

Allez
My love
My dear
My love
My tears

Too soon
Too late
Complete

And from way down deep inside
Like a wave I had crashed on the
Reason I
Was there

My love
My dear
My love
My tears
Come See

Tell me, is this real?
Everything I feel?

Tell me this is real
