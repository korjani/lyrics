Criminal
I'd bet you're bad
See the knife in the water
Send you back to bed

All over your body
This electricity
It was all that I wanted
Now it's killin' me

You say you're ready
If I'm an animal
Let's get a room real soon
We'll call it supernatural

All over your body
Now say it back to me
Some call it chemical
I call it bittersweet

Sympathy
If your light should go unseen
And I'll be there to share
If you don't mind the company

All over your
Your bastion bed
So far inside you now
I am your silhouette

You can believe me now
This isn't happening
You're not the first to be stoned
You're not the last to believe

Sympathy
If your light should go unseen
If you're not ready now
You're never going to be
All over me
All over me
If you're not ready now
You're never going to be
