Staring blindly through blizzard
Chasing after your restless heart
Mind is buzzing like Helicopter
Cutting quickly through the dark

Smoke is pouring from my windows
And I'm reaching out my hand
Hoping someone's at my fingertip
That can help me understand

That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

Yelling for the sun as the water rises
Feeling like smoke, filling up your eyes
Swinging at a ghost, go and lock that door
Leave that wreckage, let it wash ashore

Go save yourself up, it's a hell of a ride
Feel your heart racing in the middle of the night
Step out of your mind into the wild, wild, wild, wild

That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

We're all fighting to make something for ourselves

Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
