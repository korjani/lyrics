And if you say say say
We're holding that weight together, together
And if you break break break
We're holding that weight together, together

Staring at the universe
Falling out of space headfirst
Walking with your torch burned out
You were always full of doubt

Covering the trail we crossed
Higher than the things we've lost
Looking down the dragon's mouth
I'll never let you hit the ground

Even if the walls are melting in
The sand will wash away the ghost again
A beacon in the night will take those
Black waves and turn them blue

And if you say say say
We're holding that weight together, together
And if you break break break
We're holding that weight together, together

If it was any other moment
Tangled up in time
We would end up broken
Drowning in the night

So won't you stay stay stay
We're holding that weight together, together

Driving through a broken town
Where people go to lay it down
Caught up in the whiskey wind
Pushing on the best of friends

Stumbled down a darker path
Two fists full of shattered glass
Searching for your living room
The light is always on for you

Even if the walls are melting in
The sand will wash away the ghost again
A beacon in the night will take those
Black waves and turn them blue

And if you say say say
We're holding that weight together, together
And if you break break break
We're holding that weight together, together

If it was any other moment
Tangled up in time
We would end up broken
Drowning in the night

So won't you stay stay stay
We're holding that weight together, together

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And if you say say say
We're holding that weight together, together
And if you break break break
We're holding that weight together, together, together

And if you say say say
We're holding that weight together, together
And if you break break break
We're holding that weight together, together

If it was any other moment
Tangled up in time
We would end up broken
Drowning in the night

So won't you stay stay stay
We're holding that weight together, together, together
