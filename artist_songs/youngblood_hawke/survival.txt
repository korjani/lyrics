That fire burning deep inside the start
You know, you know
You just keep that fire burning
That fire burning deep inside your heart
You know, you know
You just keep that fire burning, fire burning

Now I hear survival calling
Red house we had is fallen
It's gone

Tearing down the walls and
Building up and launching
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm sure I'll miss you when I'm gone

That fire burning deep inside the start
You know, you know (hey)
You just keep that fire burning
(You just keep that fire burning)

That fire burning deep inside your heart
You know, you know (hey)
You just keep that fire burning
You just keep that fire burning

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart

Hurricane rain but it's all dried up
If we survive this then it's easy
To have it all

Faint signals from above
Now this is what I want
This is not where I die
Won the loves to a black hole 
With a ladder gone 
I'm moving on, I'm moving on

'Cause when the arrows start to fly
I'm halfway home
When the hurricane rain is gone

That fire burning deep inside the start
You know, you know (hey)
You just keep that fire burning
(You just keep that fire burning)

That fire burning deep inside your heart
You know, you know (hey)
You just keep that fire burning
You just keep that fire burning

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart
In your heart, in your heart

(now) I hear survival calling
(now) I hear survival calling
(now) I hear survival calling
Calling, calling, calling...

You just keep that fire burning
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart
In your heart

You just keep that fire burning
(You just keep that fire burning)
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart
In your heart (in your heart)
In your heart (in your heart)
In your heart
