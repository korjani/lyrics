I'm going back through time
before the war this crime
who would have believed
that they would do it
One April morning
without a warning
the sirens woke us up
two minutes to live we got

I'm dying I'm crying
still I'm the lord
I'm fighting denying
still I'm the lord
of the wasteland

Now I'm alone here
the last man on earth I'll be
walking through chaos land
there's just black mist and sand

I'm dying I'm crying
still I'm the lord
I'm fighting denying
still I'm the lord
of the wasteland
