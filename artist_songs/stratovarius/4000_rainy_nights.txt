These empty days are filling me with pain
After I left it seems my life is only rain
My heart is longing to the better times
When everything was still so fine

I wonder why it happens so fast
You give your heart away knowing it might not last
I'm still here waiting for the rain to fall
And to see you once again

4000 Rainy Nights
4000 Nights I'd be with you
4000 Rainy Nights with you

I keep your memory in my heart
You give me hope when everything is so dark
That thing nobody can take away
Forever in me

4000 Rainy...
