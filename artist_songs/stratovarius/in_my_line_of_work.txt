You deserve everything
Everything that you need
And all that you long for

But I, I'm rarely around
Every train feels outbound
I wish I could give you so much more

I must roam
Follow the road I've chosen
Leave our home
The land is dark and frozen
Night by night
You're still in my mind
Everything I must do
Is your burden too

Still the road goes on and on
We just have to play along
Days are lonely, nights long
In my line of work

This is how the story goes
Highest highs and lowest lows
Home is never too close
In my line of work

Here the rules don't apply
Another town passes by
New faces, new strangers

And you could use someone new
Someone better than me
But I still hope you will be waiting

I must roam
Follow the road I've chosen
Leave our home
The land is dark and frozen
Night by night
You're still in my mind
Everything I must do
Is your burden too

Still the road goes on and on
We just have to play along
Days are lonely, nights long
In my line of work

This is how the story goes
Highest highs and lowest lows
Home is never too close
In my line of work
