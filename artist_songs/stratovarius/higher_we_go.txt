Feeling so sad and tense
Confusion on my mind
Nothing makes any sense
Things are entwined

Hopeless soul in the haze
Trying to find the way
Out of this wicked maze
To a new day

We will rise out of agony
And find a way to victory

Higher we go
Climbing up to the skies
Higher we go
A new day will arise

When all is crashing down
I know the time will heal
In this insanity
We'll find what is real

Together we are so strong
Holding our heads up high
We will carry on
'Til the day we die

We will rise out of agony
And find a way to victory

Higher we go
Climbing up to the skies
Higher we go
A new day will arise

Higher we go
Climbing up to the skies
Higher we go
A new day will arise
