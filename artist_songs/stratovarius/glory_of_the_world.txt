The sun is setting on the pain the people freezing in the rain the
Earth is rolling in her grave
I beg the light up in the sky to make me whole,
to tell me why I can't be bothered to be brave
and I've been waiting, and hesitating, and then I see the curtain fall:
the wonder of it all
my heart was blind, but now I see I know the power and the glory of the world
I took a breath and now I'm free I feel the glory of the world
the demons sometimes find a way there's nothing keeping them at bay
but for the power of my mind
the road to paradise is long and halfway there,
I'm heading wrong I'm leaving all the pain behind
the wonder of it all my heart was blind,
but now I see I know the power and the glory of the world
I took a breath and now I'm free I feel the glory of the world
