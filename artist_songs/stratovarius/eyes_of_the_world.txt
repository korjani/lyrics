Everywhere I go I see people staring at me
It makes me feel so strange
why won't they just leave me be
So take a look in the mirror
and maybe you'll see all the things that happened
while you were looking at me

Am I really so different
In the Eyes of the world
you are no different to me
In the Eyes of the world
is it so hard to see now

Everything we do is running to the sand
And who is to take the food away
from the children's hand
We all could be friends now
and it's not a crime
But we have to be quick now
because we don't have much time

Are we really so different
In the Eyes of the world
you are no different to me
In the Eyes of the world
is it so hard to see now
