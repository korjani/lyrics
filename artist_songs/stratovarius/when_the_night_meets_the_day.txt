Look around there's no time to waste
Life goes on nothing's gonna change
Feel the winds of life blowing cold
It won't take so long you are growing old
There is no answer to be found
It is so easy to fall without a sound

Days of loving and gold
Kept me from feeling so old
Times I'll always recall
When the night meets the day
Gates of heaven I saw
While flying through the misty dawn
Those days I'll always recall
When the night meets the day

I don't wanna let you out of my sight
But here I'm lost and alone in the night
