I was sent out
To the world
From the mission
I just returned
The dust has not settled down yet
Still I am needed more fame to be earned

I thought I could have some rest
But I feel like I am possessed
I shouldn't be complaining cause I am blessed

Must have been the Gypsy
The Gypsy in me

All the pressure
On my shoulder
I can feel
It makes me older
I've given everything tonight
It is enough I still have to fight
My heart is beating so fast
If this breath would be my last
Would I die happy or would I regret my past

Must have been the Gypsy
The Gypsy in me

Must have been a mistake
But I agreed
