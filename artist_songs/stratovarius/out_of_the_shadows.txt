Out to the light from the mist
From the shadows I go
Facing the new world the odd things
The places unknown
Far away I sail away today

Seeing a new face impression the moment
The thought
Unarmed and naked defendless
My mind is caught
Far away it sails away to stay

Out of the shadows we go
There's no reason to hide anymore
Out of the shadows we go
Into the new horizon
Towards the new shore we go
