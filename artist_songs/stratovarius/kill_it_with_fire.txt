Alone in the prison I made of my mind
like many mornings before
I stare in the ceiling until I go blind
it's hard to take anymore
I ask from the fools how they slumber away
with all the evil around
but no one can answer and no one can say
and there's no peace to be found

A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away
if we are to live we will have to unite
kill it with fire! Burning higher!

At five in the morning I'm drowning my fears
it seems the right thing to do
a blanket of calm in this valley of tears
tomorrow rises anew

A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away
if we are to live we will have to unite
kill it with fire! Burning higher!

Like cockroaches baking in sunlight of day
the world is bustling along
while lawyers and bankers are nibbling away
we have to try to stay strong

A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away
if we are to live we will have to unite
kill it with fire! Burning higher!
