Shades of night
I'm walking through sleeping village
that is having a dream of thousand dreams
Moon is guiding my way through the land
the snow is silently falling
from the sky that is lit by million stars

Nightfall
I feel the breeze
Nightfall
on my face
Nightfall
and the trees are
Nightfall
covered with white lace
