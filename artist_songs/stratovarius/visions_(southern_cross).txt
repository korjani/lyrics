I have seen the future of mankind,
The wisdom of my prophecies you'll find.
Follow the truth and be careful, are we the last?

Hundred years has passed what have we done,
Inconceivable damage under the sun.
I think it's too late to change the man - we are the last.

The world keeps turning while people yearn for more,
Mother nature is crying for change,
The time will come when we all must pay for what we have done,
Are you prepared for that?

As we are reaching the end of the century
There's message we can send,
Be strong and bold and never lose your mind
'cause we are the last.

The world keeps turning while people yearn for more,
Mother nature is crying for change,
the time will come when we all must pay for what we have done,
Are you prepared for that?

Signs of the end I see,
Let them hear my voice in every corner of the world,
Take heed of the warnings that I give,
I have seen the Southern Cross forming in the sky.

"There shall be heard in the air the noise of weapons
and in the same year the divines shall be enemies.
They shall unjustly put down the holy laws
and by thunder and war, true believers shall die"
[Nostradamus: Century I V:43]

"For forty years the rainbow shall not appear
For forty years it shall be seen every day
The parched earth shall wax drier every day
And a great flood when it shall appear"
[Nostradamus: Century I:17]

After us the road goes on forever
Many changes lie along the path
That's the price we pay for our selfishness
We are headed for the end

"From the skies shall come the powerful kind
Before and after the Mars reigns at will
Not far from the great age of Millennium
Buried ones shall come out of their graves"
[Nostradamus: Century X:72, 74]

When the comet tears out the sky
You and I must die
After all this the time will come for the chosen ones
To rise from their graves to be free again

The beast is gone forever, there's no more pain
Instead so many things for us to attain
The sun is shining brightly after the rain
The land is green and full of life again

The sorrows wiped away now
It's time to smile
And learn from the past
Together we will try

"Twenty years of reign of the moon having past
Seven thousand years another shall hold his monarchy
When the sun shall resume his days past
Then is fulfilled and ends my prophecy"
[Nostradamus: Century I:48]
