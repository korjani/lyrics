Life will go on
Soon it is gone
It's bigger that we can conceive
Wink of an eye
A thousand years
Into eternity we shed our tears

I'm changing,
Rearranging my destiny

Learning to fly
Touching sky on my way
Learning to fly
High above the sorrows
To a new day I fly

Not where you stand
Nor where you are
It matters only where you look
To take the good
With (all that's) bad
It is the only way to go

The minutes
The hours
The years
Run fast

Learning to fly
Touching sky on my way
Learning to fly
High above the sorrows
To a new day I fly

Learning to fly
Touching sky on my way
Learning to fly
High above the sorrows I fly

Learning to fly
Touching sky on my way
Learning to fly
High above the sorrows
To a new day I fly
