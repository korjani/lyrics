Climbing mountain
Big stone on my back
Hopeless feeling
Everything is black

What am I fighting for?
What am I living for?
That is the part that I don't know

You gotta fight
Fight for your life
Until you die
Fight for your life

Endless searching
In the cyberspace
All is turning
Into a disgrace
What am I searching for?
What am I running for?
That is the part I don't know

You gotta fight
Fight for your life
Until you die
Fight for your life
