I set my goals higher every day
I make my own rules that I will obey
As long as I live

This is the life I was born to lead
A unique chance for me to express myself
And fulfill my dreams

I'm in control of this ship of mine
And everything will be just fine

Like the wind I'm free to go anywhere
I got my song, it dances in the air
Now I know what to do with my life
So you will hear my freedom call

All those bad things I once went through
Changed into blessings when I changed the point of view
I needed them to grow

I've changed so much, I'm finally free
To do what I want without feeling of guilt or fear
It's so amazing

I'm in control of this ship of mine
And everything will be just fine

Like the wind I'm free to go anywhere
I got my song, it dances in the air
Now I know what to do with my life
So you will hear my freedom call

Like the wind I'm free to go anywhere
I got my song, it dances in the air
Now I know what to do with my life
So you will hear my freedom call
