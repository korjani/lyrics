If I could stay awake for awhile
I would see another morning
Don't wanna fall asleep now when
Everything seems so far and beyond

Walking down a familiar road
But the darkness is misleading me
I know I should feel fear inside
But still the shadows is where I wanna be

Just an ordinary day stealing all the hope away
Wanting me to be the one who has dreams made of clay

My fading confused mind
Creating phrases unknown

I know I shouldn't stay awake
If I fall asleep they just might find me
Now all is so clear
I can finally proceed

My fading confused mind
Creating phrases unknown

Waiting for the dawn
Soon to arrive
So few options that I have
And I can use
Life's circumstances
Can be so cruel
If I take a chance I just might
Make the wrong move
