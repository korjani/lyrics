Went into the plane was scared like hell
tried to relax for awhile
But when we took off I feared we would fall
waving goodbye to this life

I'm flying through winds tonight
no sign of the dawn or light

Silhouettes in the sky
wings are carrying me through the night
Silhouettes in the sky
destination unknown - Distant Skies

Then after awhile I tried to sleep
but watched two movies instead
The fear struck again how I hate this plane
Hope this would come to an end

I'm flying through winds tonight
no sign of the dawn or light

Silhouettes in the sky
wings are carrying me through the night
Silhouettes in the sky
destination unknown - Distant Skies
