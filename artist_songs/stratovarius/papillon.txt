Flying to the day
One day to play
With eyes open wide
I am Papillon

I watch the world
Curiously
World is my home
I am Papillon

I have no God
Life is in me
I am in life
I am Papillon

Brightest of days
Holds me in embrace
I am free
I am Papillon

In my dreams
In my life
In my soul
In my eyes
In my heart
I am real
Ah, I am Papillon

In my dreams
In my life
In my soul
In my eyes
In my heart
I am real
Ah, I am Papillon

I watch the world
Curiously
World is my home
I am Papillon
