I'm staring out the window
wondering will I soon know
the answers to the questions within
where should I begin
I'm delusioned by a clear crystal night
While trying to find some insight
the solution is close at hand yet still so far away

I'll turn the tables 'round and find another way
I'll leave all this behind and move on today

I will take things as they come
look out for number one
and I'll be back tomorrow
Feeling strong and brave inside
my head up high with pride
yes I'll be back tomorrow

I'm facing my nightmares again
determined that I won't bend
now the answers are coming to me
I'm learning how to believe
I know now that this is the way
I've found my red-letter day
I've been there out on a limb
but now I've finally come in

I've turned the tables 'round and found another way
I've left it all behind for a better day

I will take things as they come
look out for number one
and I'll be back tomorrow
Feeling strong and brave inside
my head up high with pride
yes I'll be back tomorrow
