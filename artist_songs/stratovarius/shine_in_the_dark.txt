When I was young and life had only just begun
The days were long and bright
So warm and full of light
I never knew that one day you would fade away
Your colors fade to gray
It seems like yesterday

Still you're shining in the dark
You're still safe within my heart
Where my memories lie and
I will follow you
Wherever you go

[Chorus:]
I am what you made of me
Your blood is my blood, and your heart is my heart
We are what we leave behind
An eternal stream
You flow through me

And I fear no more though you're gone
I know we'll meet again
I know you're there, still somewhere
You are waiting

You are the mystery that only I can know
The gentle wings that blow
The glitter on the snow
I never speak about you
Never say your name
It's not that I don't care
It's just that I'm not there

You're still gone and I'm still here
Yet I always feel you near
Wherever I go

[Chorus]

Still you're shining in the dark
You're still safe within my heart
Wherever you are

[Chorus 2x]

And I fear no more though you're gone
I know we'll meet again
I know you're there, still somewhere
You are waiting
