Come to me my disciples
Said the stranger who came
Healed the sick fed the poor
Spread the joy and the cure

He will rule our land
With his leading hand
We'll achieve our deliverance
Is it just an illusion
Or the mass confusion
Is it just the work of the False Messiah?

Victims of mass confusion
Fools will follow this man
He leads us to destruction
Tending us to damnation

He will rule...
