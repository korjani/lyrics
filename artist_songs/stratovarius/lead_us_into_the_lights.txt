Hey you take a look around
Can you feel the change begin?
Soon it will be too late
If you don't wake up
Outside the winds are bloring
And the people are staring so cold
The look that's in their eyes
Tells me something's wrong

Lead us into the light

It's so strange
We have gone too far
Still knowing what will happen
When we close our eyes
Is this the hell on earth?
And the heaven is out of our sight
Open your eyes and realize
It's not too late

Lead us into the light
