When clouds are covering the sky
I can't help thinking what's behind
In a fading evening
I can feel strange thoughts in my mind
What if we aren't alone here
there's a clone of everyone somewhere
that duplicates all that we do
not like me not like you but our other ego
there ain't no wars or crises
only joy and compromises
time has stood still

why don't you take me there
wanna feel some infinity
why don't we just dare
coz after all remains ... Eternity

A landscape with no trees
and a mist arising from the distance
an illusion just for me
or a proper reward and a chance
there ain't no wars or crises
only joy and compromises
time has stood still

why don't you take me there
wanna feel some infinity
why don't we just dare
coz after all remains ... Eternity
