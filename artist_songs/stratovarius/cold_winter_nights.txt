Summer's gone a while ago
The daylight dims away
I'm watching here how the snow begins to fall
Yesterday's like a dream
A memory in my head
Like the life's gone behind the winter wall

I'm lighting up the candles and lock the door
Sitting by the fire
It's time to dream some more

I have to find a way how to survive
I am surrounded by the starlight
I have to find the path
How to escape from the Cold Winter Nights

And in the morning there's no trace of the sun
Just gray fog hanging above my head
All the birds are quiet hiding in the woods
Can't see no movement are they all dead?
