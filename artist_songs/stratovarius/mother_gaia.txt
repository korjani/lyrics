Time waits for no one So they say It goes on forever
The tears of pain
I see in your eyes
How can we change for the better?
Hate and greed's getting stronger day by day
Injustice rules the world
Killing the lungs of the Earth
How far are we prepared to go?
I have seen the Light It came into my life There's no second chance
We should have learned by now
But it's not too late to change the course
There's so much more than this, oh Mother Gaia
Can you see, can you feel all the beauty that we have in this world?
There's so much to see, forever Ignorance, arrogance
Keep us from being ourselves so we just follow our leaders - Why
