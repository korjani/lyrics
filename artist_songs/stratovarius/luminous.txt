Luminous we shine
Like the stars on the evening sky
Through the universe
And centuries
They are calling
Hear them calling
Luminous moonshine
Is guiding my travel through life
Through the wind sometime
I hear angels calling
Hear them calling

No tree has branches so foolish
As to fight among themselves
We share the same biology
We are one
We are luminous

Luminous when we die
We return to the great ocean
Of the living energy
It is calling
Hear it calling
Luminous my life
A breath in the cosmic play
Without reason or rhyme
It is calling
Hear it calling

No tree has branches so foolish
As to fight among themselves
We share the same biology
We are one
We are luminous
