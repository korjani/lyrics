This is my way, these are my rules
These are my rhymes, this is my song
Don't take me for some bloody fool
For I still dream, you can't hurt me, I'm strong

You can try to bring me down, to keep me down
I will rise and I'll be fighting back
There's no way you can break my will

My dreams are guiding my every step
I have a destiny to fulfill

No one can bring me down
I will defend my beliefs
And I will stand my ground
I need to see where it leads

No one can bring me down
I will defend my beliefs
And I will stand my ground
I need to see where it leads

You can try to bring me down, to keep me down
I will rise and I'll be fighting back
There's no way you can break my will

My dreams are guiding my every step
I have a destiny to fulfill

No one can bring me down
I will defend my beliefs
And I will stand my ground
I need to see where it leads
