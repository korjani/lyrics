When you tell me that your truth
will set me free
Don't believe you and I wish
you'd let me be
From the cradle to the grave
I feel your pain
But I'm trying to erase
you from my brain

Carry me to the shore,
Carry me, I can't stand it anymore

I am blind, but I can see you in my mind
I am blind, but I can see you
I am blind

When you say you have a way
to make me talk
I just wanna turn around
and start to walk
Can't you see, don't want
to be inside your mind
Set me free leave me be
and make me blind

Carry me to the shore,
Carry me, I can't stand it anymore

I am blind, but I can see you in my mind
I am blind, but I can see you
I am blind

I am blind, but I can see you in my mind
I am blind, but I can see you
I am blind
I am blind, but I can see you in my mind
I am blind, but I can see you
I am blind
