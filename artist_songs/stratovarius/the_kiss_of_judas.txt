I hear footsteps closing in
I recognize them from my early days.
The times are different the image remains the same
Repeating back flashes remembering the name,
Approaching visions of things I can't recall,
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises, the night awaits, the act of confidence

The kiss of Judas I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas haunts me once again
In your privage chamber, you're all alone.

The well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
The flame of the candle casting movement to the wall
Your eyes filled with guilt keep staring at the door
Approaching visions of things I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises, the night awaits, the act of confidence

The kiss of Judas I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas haunts me once again
Unkept promises, the night awaits, the act of confidence

The kiss of Judas I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas haunts me once again
Unkept promises, the night awaits, the act of confidence

The kiss of Judas I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas haunts me once again
