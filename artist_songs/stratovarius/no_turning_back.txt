So long I have been accepting what I've seen
Never really speaking my mind
Now the heat's leaking out
I'd like to scream and shout
I want to leave it all behind

There's no one else to turn the wheel
I've got my own life to steer

No turning back
Coz I wanna know who I am and I want to live my life
No turning back
Tomorrow's awaiting, I'm on the way

Hard to find the right words
And not to make it worse
A choice that has to be done
It is just my life
Can't make no compromise
And to stop what has begun

There's no one else...

I have all the strings in my hands
The choices that's been laid for me
I am not taking more commands
Coz now finally I'm free
