I will call for you,
Said the man to the fool as he rode,
Out with his gold in his hand.
Finally I know the truth, thought the fool to himself,
I really understand.

Paradise calling me,
After life, eternity.
No more life, the divine set me free...

Gloria, (Gloria),
Is awaiting me there.
Gloria is my destiny.
Gloria, (Gloria),
Is awaiting me there.
Gloria is my destiny.

Many years have passed,
No one came, not a sign from the gods,
No one believes the end of the world.

Paradise calling me,
After life, eternity.
No more life, the divine set me free...

Gloria, (Gloria),
Is awaiting me there.
Gloria is my destiny.
Gloria, (Gloria),
Is awaiting me there.
Gloria is my destiny.
I come home...

Gloria!
