More that I live More clear it's each day We got to change our ways
There is no way to go back anymore Eons rumble through space
We must find new ways to live I know there's so much more to give
Millennium - Where do we go?
Millennium - Time will show
Forevermore - The light will be guiding our journey
Millennium - Show us the way
Millennium - To the new day
Forevermore - Give us a chance to change
People may come and people may go But dance of time is eternal
What is the meaning of this cosmic play?
Will we see another day?
We must find new ways...
