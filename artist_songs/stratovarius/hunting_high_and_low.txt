I feel the wind in my hair, and it's whispering, telling me things,
of the storm that is gathering near full of power I'm spreading my wings
Now I'm leaving my worries behind Feel the freedom of body
and mind I have started my journey,
I'm drifting away with the wind I go I am Hunting High and Low
diving from the sky above looking for, more and more, once again
I'm Hunting High and Low Sometimes I may win sometimes I'll lose
It's just a game that I play
After the storm there's a calm through the clouds shines a ray of the sun
I am carried from all of my harm there is no-one that I can't outrun
Now I'm leaving my worries behind Feel the freedom of body
and mind I have started my journey, I'm drifting away with the wind I fly,
