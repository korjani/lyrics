Hear my call don't waste your time
remember what we're fighting for
Hear my voice take my hand
We've got to win this war

We were meant to be free
not to live in slavery

To the other Galaxie we go
gather all our strength before they know
Soon the time will come for all of us
to unite our souls and hearts
save the universe
