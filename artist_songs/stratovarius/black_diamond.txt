Again I see you standing there watching me.
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly, inviting me to get close to you,
can't help myself.
There's fascination in the air.
I try to fight this strong sensation but there's no chance to escape
from this temptation.
Feels like I've known you before, repeating phrases,
but I yearn for something more.
I know I can't stay by your side forever,
but I know I won't forget your beauty,
my Black Diamond.
