Season of change life feels so strange
Look into my eyes do you see the truth
I'm lost and alone feelings unknown
Come to me stronger than before

On winds of time my soul will fly
The angels are knocking at my door
Oh now I need to be free
From all this hatred I feel inside

Let it be my dreams
Let it be my thoughs
All those things in my heart
One too many days
One too many years
I wasted for nothing

I never realized
The truth is inside
Of every man for all to see
Listen to me now
I'm so close to you
Never felt like this before

The carousel is spinning fast
better enjoy while it lasts
Every moment is like gold
you'll remember when you're old
And the meaning of this life
is to live and is to die
Make the best out of your dreams
they're the world where you are free
All the sorrow and the pain
will be washed away by rain
An eternal joy will come
it can be found by everyone
Though the end is drawing near
I'm not feeling any fear
I have found the truth inside
after all the tears I've cried

Season of Change...
