Today is just an other day
of my life too short to live
I should have some kind of meaning
a destiny to believe in
before I go to sleep

I find some pictures of a time
when everything was still so fine
although the years have passed by
I will give it all I have inside...everything

I'm away lost in my thoughts
everyday my life goes by
at the speed of light
