You've faded away
And woe is all that remains
And I have gone astray
My mind full of fury and stains

I'm carrying a seed of insanity
A burden of faded memories

Delusion, destruction, salvation
Now I am forsaken

Bleed in this creed
Awareness all numb this time
Underneath the skin
You're still drilling in

And what I've come to find
A state of mind
I need to find
A way to clarify
My soul will once again be free

But first I need to bury the stain

Infernal Maze
I'm lost within an infernal game
Infernal Maze
My demons are calling out your name
Infernal Maze.

Infernal Maze
I'm lost within an infernal game
Infernal Maze
My demons are calling out your name
Infernal Maze.

Infernal Maze
I'm lost within an infernal game
Infernal Maze
My demons are calling out your name
Infernal Maze.

Infernal Maze
These demons, these demons,
Haunting me, Infernal Maze
Infernal Maze
Infernal Maze.
