Feel the night, conceal your fright
It came from your right
Look what you found lying on the ground
Shiny ball you don't know anything at all

Look through yourself there's a mystery full of you
Always condemn though you never understand
Why you resist never knew how to fight
You touch the light
It's Fright Night
It's Fright Night

In the dark the shining spark
Follow this mystery ball
But don't look back there's force of evil so black
Ready to take you away

Look trough...

Look around is this the end you see?
Wrapped inside the pain and misery
Is it true when you say that you never would give up
Memories fill my mind I can see childhood again

Look I've found my old toys
They bring mem'ries in my head
And now we are big boys and that feeling
Is dead and it's gone

Glimpse of the childhood appears to me so clear
Tales from Sherwood they fade away disappear
Where am I going I can't see a solution
I'm here alone in the heart of the darkest night

It's Fright Night
