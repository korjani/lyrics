I am facing the truth I got to change the way I live
Can't go on this way The price is too high to pay
After the rain I feel the sun
See how I run to my destiny
Life is a game I got to learn how to play I make my own rules
'cause now I am free to choose
Courage and faith will show me the way Se how I run to my destiny
Like the Phoenix I rise From the ashes of life I don't need fortune
or fame Just some peace of mind
Like the Phoenix I fly leaving the lies behind
Future's golden for me There is no one who can stop me now
I'm noble and strong I'm walking down the road that I choose
Each day is a gift And I know that I can't lose
Glorious future is waiting for me See how I run to my destiny
Like the Phoenix...
