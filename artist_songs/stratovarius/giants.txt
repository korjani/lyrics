Haven't you ever been drowning in sorrow?
In the morning,
Because you're never gonna fly.

So insignificant, waiting for daybreak,
With a heartache,
Under the black and evil sky.

Life is unfair,
And nobody cares,
But did you think for a moment that you are so rare?
We are the hope of a world in despair.

We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And we will carry this power to the skies.
We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And take a look inside of you,
Then you'll see your power too.

Look at your life and reflect on the magic,
That you're given,
From many kin you never met.

Life is unfair,
And nobody cares,
But did you think for a moment that you are so rare?
We are the hope of a world in despair.

We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And we will carry this power to the skies.
We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And take a look inside of you,
Then you'll see your power too.

(We are the glory! We have the power!)
(We are the joy of a world without care!)
(We are the glory! We have the power!)
(We are the hope of a world in despair!)

Did you think for a moment that you are so rare?

We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And we will carry this power to the skies.
We stand on the shoulders of giants,
And take a look inside of you,
Then you'll see your power too.
