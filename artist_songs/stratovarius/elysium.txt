[Part 1]

I've never felt like this before
Am I awaken or drifting?
There's a hole in the sky
Am I alive? Did I survive?

Broken pictures on my wall
A story of fallen heroes
Now stare ahead with their blind eyes on
Lost horizon

Sometimes the traces of life with you
Are clearer in my mind than ever
I'm reaching this feeling
It's misleading me away from you

Tonight I'll find what I've been searching for
You can rip off my wings once more
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore

[Solo ‒ Matias / Jens]

Sometimes the traces of life with you
Are clearer in my mind than ever
I'm reaching this feeling
It's misleading me away from you

Tonight I'll find what I've been searching for
You can rip off my wings once more
I'm not afraid anymore
I am ready to fall
I'm not afraid anymore

[Part 2]

I am lying on the frozen ground alone
I've got lost on my way, my time is up
I'm done

I need to find the key
To eternal life and see
The joy, the smile,
The overwhelming love of your heart
Is what I need

Give me a sign, and show me the way
To the sacred place

I can hear you calling my name
From the distant skies
I am holding a falling angel
In my arms

Your shadow lurking in the corner of my eye
I'm losing sense of what's real
and what's a lie

I need to find the key
To eternal life and see
The joy, the smile,
The overwhelming love of your heart
Is what I need

Give me a sign, and show me the way
To the sacred place

I can hear you calling my name
From the distant skies
I am holding a falling angel
In my arms

How all began?
Your faith was not mine
Remedy this fallen life

I feel it burning with me ahead
The earth is turning to red
I'm staring at the flaming skies
Too tired to figth, I just close my eyes

[Solo ‒ Jens / Matias / Duet]

I can hear you calling my name
From the distant skies
I am holding a falling angel
In my arms

I am holding a falling angel
in my arms

[Part 3]

This life has been too long
There's hope everywhere I go

Do you believe in hope and faith
Or eternity?
In the end, you will see
Let this soul be free

Eternal light
Blinded my eyes

Feel no sorrow
Joy will follow
Now lay down
And rest in my arms

[Solo ‒ Jens]

Do you believe in hope and faith
Or eternity?
In the end, you will see
Let your soul be free

Be afraid no more,
Just take my hand,
I'll guide you through the storm
We're finally home

Do you believe in hope and faith
Or eternity?
In the end, you will see
Let your soul be free

Be afraid no more,
Just take my hand,
I'll guide you through the storm
We're finally home

We're finally home
