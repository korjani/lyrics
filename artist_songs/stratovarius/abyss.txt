I'm out on the open sea
the wind is embracing me
I'm watching the setting sun
Far far away from you
there's not much that I could
Do you know what's the only way for me

Into the depths I fall
into the unknown darkness I go

Down, Down, Down
down, down, down
falling into the Abyss

A morning of no recall
no memory no nothing at all
the sun is blinding my eyes
The pain I feel in my head
I think I go back to bed
Or should I have just one more

Into the depths I fall
into the unknown darkness I go

Down, Down, Down
down, down, down
falling into the Abyss
