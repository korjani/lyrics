On the long and winding road
If I say there's no tomorrow
If I say there's only sorrow
Would you ever let me be?

'Cause I'm drowning in despair
I can barely stay in focus
And I can't get it together anymore
Anymore

But somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
But somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes

When you're tired to the bone
And your batteries are empty
When your dreams have turned to ashes
Would you ever just let go?

I would hope you change your mind
'Cause the road goes on forever
And a song can help find your
Way back home

But somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
Somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes

Somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
Somehow it's all worth it and the pain inside me dies
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
When I see the fire light up in your eyes
