I don't know what to do I don't know who you are I'm calling from the silence
We have gone too far
I try to understand you, your life has been so cruel
Please try to see it my way I've got something to say
All those years Were not in vain
Even though there was much pain I try to learn from my mistakes
I want to make it up to you
A Million Light Years away from you
I am
A Million Light Years away from you
I hope that you?d respect my Honesty and faith And maybe you'd forgive me
If I could make you see I want to say I'm sorry
For what I did to you I'll get on with my life I hope you do that too
All the years...
