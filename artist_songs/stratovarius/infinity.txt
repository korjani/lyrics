Mother watch your children
The iron fist of fear is ruling our lives
It's not too late to change the course
We can make this world a better place to be in
How much more do we want until we're satisfied?
What happens when we have what we want?
Acquiring more , still there's never enough
We forget those who really are in need
The end is near, or so they say
Selling peace with guns
Infinity - Where do we go from here?
Infinity - Where do we go from here?
Infinity - Where do we go?
Infinity - Where do we go from here?
Guns spitting (out the) message of peace everywhere
Is it really that we don't care?
See mercenaries of fear selling love
Telling salvation comes from above
Arrogance and fear walking hand in hand
We must see that there's much more to life than this
Mother see your children
Make us understand and help us to find the way
The answers lie inside
They are locked inside to the vault of truth for us It's time
to spread the word around
Be yourself and do what you want to do with your life
Remember, you get just what you give
You reap all what you sow
You are in charge of your own life Infinity...
You make your own way As long as you are here
Find your place in life
Make your dreams come true
There's so much more than this
A million ways to live
Unlock the door
To the universe with love
Free your soul
