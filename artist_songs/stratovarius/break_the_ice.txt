Why do you stare at me?
It's hard to please when you're
feeling ill at ease
Hey let it go
You have feelings inside let them show

Grim craven mind
Timid all the time
Can't come out of your shell
It's hell

Shame on you
There are so many things that you could do
Hey can't you see?
Love is a stream that endlessly flows in me

Grim craven mind
Timid all the time
Can't come out of your shell
It's hell

It's time to break the ice
