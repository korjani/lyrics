In the year before we lost our empire
We were children on the march
We were told we had to serve our empire and die
In our wake we only left destruction
Sent their children to the graves
In the year before we lost our empire and died

The war was lost but we went on
Our king was dead and in the end nobody won

We were told to march to death and glory
We were told it's for our land
In the end our tribe was left with nothing and died
In the time when all our hearts were frozen
We were soldiers for the king
In our wake we left their castles burning and died

The war was lost but we went on
And when the harvest came we found our king was gone

The war was lost but we went on
And when we paid the price we found our king was gone
The war was lost but we fought on
The war was lost and in the end nobody won
