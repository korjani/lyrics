Living on the edge of falling down
Like each day would be your last one
Reaching for the stars that shine so far
Take my hand it will be alright
For you and me to go

Look into my eyes they are black as night now
You can see your reflections I tell you no lies
You are the prisoner of your own feelings it's true
There's something inside you but you just won't
let it come out

When the night comes you won't be alone
'Cause I will be there I will be there
When the darkness enters into your room
Don't be afraid 'cause I'll be there
When the darkness enters into your room

They will put you down with their minds of steel
Despise and scorn you just because they cannot feel
Hell is eternity hell is your destiny
I can see it in your eyes that you want to say
But you can't

When the night comes...

Listen to me hear what I say
You're playing so dangerous games
There is no time to waste anymore
Because it is getting so late
Get what you got, give what you can
Leave all the mem'ries behind
They'll be haunting you forever
