Since you were born pushed into corner
and left all alone
Told what to do, obey all the rules
be just like everyone else those fools
Day at the school
teacher's a bully
You're mobbed as a rule
nothing from TV
Your folks are away
you are trapped inside this house you must stay - home

Now it's time for you to move on
Leave the shadows of your past
Don't let them haunt you forever

Hold on to your dream
Somewhere there's a beam of hope
which is guiding your way through the dark
This is your chance
Your love your romance
Hold on to your dream and never give up
in your life - Hold on to your Dream
