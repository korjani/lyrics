What I feel inside my mind
Is driving me insane 
It's so hard to explain
What lies behind it all, what goes around
So I'm twisting here within loneliness

And all the pain inside now
Don't matter anyhow

There's something in the air
Something isn't there
Something that I had just yesterday
Every time I try
Reaching for the sky
Something's coming up and blocks my way
And I know that-I just need
To walk away from this 
There's something in the air
Something isn't there
The storm rages on
I'm waiting for my halcyon days

I will try to avoid it all
But they try to pull me back
If I try will I fall off this track

I don't care cos I'm free 
I'm still twisting here within loneliness

And all the pain inside now...
There's something in the air...
