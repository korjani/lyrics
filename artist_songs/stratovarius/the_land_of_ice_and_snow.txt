The land of ice and snow
Where the midnight sun blows
Hundred thousand lakes glow
In the land of ice and snow

Northern lights guide our way
Come whatever may
Forest god protects our day
In the land of ice and snow

Where Koskenkorva flows
Where the freezing wind blows
Summer nights are white and warm
In the land of ice and snow

Some might say that we are cold
Don't believe all that's been told
Our hearts are made of gold
In the land of ice and snow

We didn't bow under oppression
We fought and we died
Redeemed in blood
The land of ice and snow

Here I was born and here I've lived
And one day here I will die
Under northern starry sky
In the land of ice and snow...
