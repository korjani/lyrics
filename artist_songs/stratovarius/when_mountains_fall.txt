It was just like yesterday
When you choose to leave and I to stay
It was a warm and sunny day
But my heart felt as heavy as stone

Never told me where you went
Then again I never try to ask
Now I know in life you have one chance
And you better use it well

When the mountains fall
And the oceans flood
I'm still in search of you
Only thing I want to say
I'm still in love with you

Finally I found your place
Sadly I came three summers late
Now I'm sitting by your grave
And I sing this song for you

When the mountains fall
And the oceans flood
I'm still in search of you
Only thing i want to say
I'm still in love with you

One last thing
I have to say
I'm still in love with you
