Reach a star, travel so far or find out who you really are
Climb a hill, learn a skill, all of your dreams you can fulfill
Take a dream, make it real, don't let yourself give in to fear
Come with me you can make it anywhere

Sing along, to this song, and let it show that you're strong
Don't pretend, help a friend, they are with you until the end
You will see, you can be whatever you would like to be
Come with me you can make it anywhere

Fantasy, I want to meet you there
You will see, fantasy can become reality
Come with me, this is my fantasy
I believe, fantasy can become reality
Can you be my fantasy

Take your time, it's not a crime cause life it's always in its prime
Show you care, if you dare, because true friendship's really rare
Take a dream make it real, don't let yourself give in to fear
Come with me you can make it anywhere

Fantasy, I want to meet you there
You will see, fantasy can become reality
Come with me, this is my fantasy
I believe, fantasy can become reality
Can you be my fantasy
