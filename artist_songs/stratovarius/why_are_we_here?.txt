When the stars are gone forever and planets are turned into dust
It's a good escape to lie in the haze
In the past I found the answer in music and drinking and lust
Waiting for the end and counting the days

But I want to find an answer, so what if my terror dies
And I want to find an answer, I look in your eyes

Why are we here?
Maybe you hold the answer
Why are we here?
Maybe you hold the answer

When the sky is dark and winter has hidden the city in snow
I remember summer's not far away
And it seems the days are shorter and hours are passing so slow
It's a nice escape to roll in the hay

But I want to find an answer, so what if my terror dies
And I want to find an answer, I look in your eyes

Why are we here?
Maybe you hold the answer
Why are we here?
Maybe you hold the answer
