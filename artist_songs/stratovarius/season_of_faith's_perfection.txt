Seasons they come seasons they go
Observing them in their perfect flow
Changing my life as they pass me by
Drying my tears letting them die
In the sunrise I am born again
In the sunset I die again

What will you do when all fails?
When you feel like a ship without sails
When desperation fills your mind
And the pain makes you blind
In my silent truth I scream these words
THE HOPE IS LOUD!
Never give up

Season of faith's perfection
Hold on to your good thing
Every day there's a new chance
To start once again
Season of faith's perfection
Forgive yourself
Let go of the past
Be gentle, understand...
