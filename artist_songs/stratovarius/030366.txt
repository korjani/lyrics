I'm your god computer's my name
Give the password or you will fail
I will lock you into my mind
Your number is all you will find

Don't try to run
(I'll take your life and the will of your power)
Under the sun
(There is no place where you can hide)

If you are a virus instead
Go away there's nothing for you here
Log you out of my system
No use commands are always the same
