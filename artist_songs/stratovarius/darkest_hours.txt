These frantic memories
They bring me down, tormenting peace
The darkness drowns me
I'm restless without sleep
When day breaks, I'm still awake,
I recall my mistakes

I'll be never alone, never again, never alone,
I'll be never alone, never again, never alone...

When all my hope is gone,
I'm waiting for the dawn
I raise my head and find my own way out of the dark
I've left my past behind
I'm reaching for the light
I'm not afraid to live my life - I'll take what is mine.

I'll make my way through the darkest hours of my days!

Those frozen memories
Laid out for me, all I can see
The night surrounds me
Destroying harmony
What lies beneath, demise in me
I've lost my purity

I'll be never alone, never again, never alone,
I'll be never alone, never again, never alone...

When all my hope is gone,
I'm waiting for the dawn
I raise my head and find my own way out of the dark
I've left my past behind
I'm reaching for the light
I'm not afraid to live my life - I'll take what is mine.

I'll make my way through the darkest hours of my days!

When all my hope is gone,
I'm waiting for the dawn
I raise my head and find my own way out of the dark
I've left my past behind
I'm reaching for the light
I'm not afraid to live my life - I'll take what is mine.

When all my hope is gone,
I'm waiting for the dawn
I raise my head and find my own way out of the dark
I leave my past behind
I'm reaching for the light
I'm not afraid to live my life - I'll take what is mine.

I'll make my way through the darkest hours of my days!
