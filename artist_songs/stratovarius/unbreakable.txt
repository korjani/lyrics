Reckless wheel of time, we follow how it flies by
We still keep believing in white and comforting lies.

When it's our turn, together we stay stronger
We lay still and silent and watch how our world burns for eternity.

You carry me away, 'til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait, this moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole.

I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore.

I hold my breath and wait.

Reckless wheel of life, we see how years keep flying by
I never really cared until I opened my eyes.

The final day awaits, and the firestorm's getting closer
Under falling stars we will seal our fate for eternity.

You carry me away, 'til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait, this moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul,
You make me whole.
I want to live this second forever,
Always together, forevermore.

I hold my breath and wait 'til the end, until 'morrow we're unbreakable.

[Solo]

You carry me away, 'til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait, this moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul,
You make me whole.
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore.

We are stronger than ever, always together, forevermore.
We are stronger than ever, always together, forevermore.

I hold my breath and wait 'til the end, until 'morrow we're unbreakable.
