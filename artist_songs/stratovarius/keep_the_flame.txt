The shadow falls on me today
Why can't it fade into the distance?

And darkness calls, no other way
I rage at the riddle of existence

The day's almost gone but you'll carry on
Can you keep the flame for me?
The day's almost gone but you'll carry on
Can you keep the flame for me?

A broken plan, a fleeting past
How do we always keep on trying?

A tired man, is free at last
What would the purpose be of lying?

My life's almost gone but you'll carry on
Can you keep the flame for me?
My life's almost gone but please carry on
Could you keep the flame for me?
Will you keep the flame for me?
