I still remember when I was a child
So curious, adventurous and wild
Looked at the world with open eyes
I couldn't tell the truth from all the lies

I was taught how to live, how to behave
I was told, how to walk, to talk, to know my place
All those years I was searching for my way
All the world was my stage

So I will turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me

I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

Now I can see it all so clear
There are no boundaries and no frontier

I wouldn't change the road I'm on
My dream lives on long after I am gone

I have learned I must do whatever it takes
I make mistakes, I must fall to rise again
Break the rules, all the chains that hold me down
I may sink but I won't drown

So I will turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me

I'll show that I can't be tamed
When I'm gone remember my name
And I won't give up the fight
Go gently into the night

I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

Turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me

I'll show that I can't be tamed
When I'm gone remember my name
And I won't give up the fight
Go gently into the night

I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

I'll go on, I'll be strong alone
All I need is my eternal dream
