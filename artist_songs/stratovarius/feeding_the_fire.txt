Reading all the daily news
Full of crime, hate and abuse
Where is this world heading to

Can't you get it in your head
No brighter future lies ahead
There's nowhere to hide
We're lost and we're out of time

So hear me now
The time has come to make a stand
We lost, no one won
We fell one by one and
All we had slipped out of our hands

We will be the last
The die is cast
Open your eyes, hear the dreams burn
And light up the skies

No return, no lesson learned
We watch and we wait while everything burns
And we're just feeding the fire

While you're watching daily feeds
Have you done all of your deeds
To make our world a better place

It is not so hard to tell
It's all going straight to hell
We'll leave like we came
We'll be gone without a trace

So hear me now
The time has come to make a stand
We lost, no one won
We fell one by one and
All we had slipped out of our hands

We will be the last
The die is cast
Open your eyes, hear the dreams burn
And light up the skies

No return, no lesson learned
We watch and we wait while everything burns
And we're just feeding the fire

So hear me now
The time has come to make a stand
We lost, no one won
We fell one by one and
All we had slipped out of our hands

We will be the last
The die is cast
Open your eyes, hear the dreams burn
And light up the skies

No return, no lesson learned
We watch and we wait while everything burns
And we're just feeding
The fire that will rise
The die is cast
Open your eyes, hear the dreams burn
And light up the skies

No return, no lesson learned
We watch and we wait while everything burns
And we're just feeding the fire
