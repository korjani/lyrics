I've been lost far too long,
Need to find my way back home.
Dig a hole and hide inside,
Live to see the morning break.

Just a wayward soul,
Played the last card, lost it all.
All is gone but one remains,
In your hands I place my life.

Take me in,
Wash away the sin.
Make me whole again,
In your sanctuary.
Hideaway,
I'm your castaway.
Let me fall asleep,
Wake up to brighter day.

Take me in,
Wash away the sin.
Make me whole again,
In your sanctuary.
Hideaway,
I'm your castaway.
Let me fall asleep,
Wake up to brighter day.

Take me in,
Wash away...
Make me whole again,
In your sanctuary.
Hideaway,
I'm your castaway.
Let me fall asleep,
Wake up to brighter day.
