I worked so hard to get my aim
Pulled out wrong card is this my last game
Too fast too son you know it takes time
Hasty deeds spoilt the chances of mine

I'm burning inside outside seems all right
Try not to think about it much
It's hard to say when I will play againg

Shattered, Shattered my hands are shattered
Shattered, Shattered my life is shattered

I'm dressed to kill and ready to score
Third pain pill and there's pain no more
I can't break out, out of these walls
Walls that sometimes the skull is caled

I'm burning inside outside seems all right
Try not to think about it much
It's hard to say when I will play againg

Shattered, Shattered my hands are shattered
Shattered, Shattered my life is shattered
