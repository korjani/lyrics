I'm waiting for the rain now
To settle the dusty air
Clearing up my emotions
Facing it all if I dare

I've been thinking
I've been trying
But I've always been denying
Wasted days are still inside of me
It's time to set them free

Why don't we see what is going on?
There are not so many years to be wasted
Until the damage is done and the beauty is gone
Save Our Souls
What is the price that we pay?
Save Our Souls
Do we have nothing to say?
