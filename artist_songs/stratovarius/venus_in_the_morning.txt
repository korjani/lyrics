It's 4 in the morning
I'm gazing the sky with
Millions of stars
A moment before the Dawn
The endless Universe fills me all
Where are you now?
Alone just like me and Venus in the Morning?

I touch your face that's filled with pain
I kiss away the tears from your eyes
I've waited YOU for 8000 days
Now I've come here to set you free

But where are you now...
Forget the future don't live the past
Live for today because life goes too fast
Go find the Key to your Divine Mind
Open the Door so many answers you'll find

Like Venus in the Morning
