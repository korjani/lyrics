Scam is the way
How they play
How they make their move
Damned everyday
What they say
How they forge our truth

We've seen it all so many times before
Make a stand, their demands don't matter anymore

Uprising, uniting, all those who fear no more
Confusing, misleading, media's hard to read

What is real, what's the deal
Is it all done in the name of greed

What we feel is right and true
What we have is still
Inside our burning heart
Not torn apart, now we need to
Rise above it
They can write another lie
They can try to make us weaker
We won't bend, fight 'til the end
We won't yield
We'll rise above it

What they write isn't right
It doesn't matter if it serves the plan
Don't believe what you see
Just try to understand

We've seen it all so many times before
Make a stand, their demands don't matter anymore

What we feel is right and true
What we have is still
Inside our burning heart
Not torn apart, now we need to
Rise above it
They can write another lie
They can try to make us weaker
We won't bend, fight 'til the end
We won't yield
We'll rise above it

What we feel is right and true
What we have is still
Inside our burning heart
Not torn apart, now we need to
Rise above it
They can write another lie
They can try to make us weaker
We won't bend, fight 'til the end
We won't yield
We'll rise above it

We'll deny their every lie
And we, we'll rise above it
We won't bend, we won't yield
They'll see we'll rise above it!
We are free, you and me
And we, we'll rise above it
We won't bend, we won't yield
They'll see
