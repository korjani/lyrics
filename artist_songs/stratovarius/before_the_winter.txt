Before the summer turns to winter, before the dreams will turn to snow.
I see the yellow leaves are falling and soon I know I have to go.
But I'll be back before the summer, next year you're in my arms again.
The winter breeze will send my message, it will keep you warm until then.
The path to home is long and winding.
I'll keep the flame alive for you until I am back.
You and I will walk that road together,
I'll show that all the dreams are true
if you only let them be before the winter.
