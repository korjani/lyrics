Tears of Ice falling down my cheeks
forming a lake in it's surface
I see you face and I watch it till it's gone
There were times all I did was cry out your name
only thing I feel now is pain

Tears of Ice frozen heart icy drop fall to the ground
forming stream golden dream
that will lead me to your door
There were times all I did was cry out your name
only thing I feel now is pain

Baby you should see what you did to me
now I am crying tears of ice
Baby you should feel like I felt in those days
now I am crying tears of ice
