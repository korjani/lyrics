And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
Of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky
And I fell behind

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"
Into the fortress and you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all I built the wall

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't, they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet
