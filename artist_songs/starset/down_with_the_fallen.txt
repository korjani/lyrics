Tired eyes, barely open
Crippled by a promise broken
I have seen an empire falling
Hopeless, can you hear me calling?
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

Searching through the darkness below
For a light in seas of shadows
Far from you, but I could never
Abdicate, I'll fight forever
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

I will not run
I will not fall
I will not bury it
This is war!!!!
War!!!!
This is war!!!!
War!!!!

Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again
Ooooo
