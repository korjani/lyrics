Darkening skies
Coming this way
Falling behind
Into nothing

But if you lead I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me

Blinded I wait
The end is forming
You are my fate
Give me warning

If you lead I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me

Far across the emptiness I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above the worlds to be the guides
But they are pale against the light in your eyes

In your eyes

And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me
