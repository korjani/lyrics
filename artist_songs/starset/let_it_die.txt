I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

And you left me more dead
Than you'll ever know
When you left me alone

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[3x]
Let it die
