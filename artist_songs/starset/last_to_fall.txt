And I fly
Further away
Than I've ever been before
It's safe to say
This sky
Is lonely and grey
But every night I feel your gravity waves

And the world is cold
But it's beautiful
I wish you were here now
I miss your soul
But you lost your light
When the darkness called
But I stand here waiting

The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall

And I fly
Above the enslaved
My soul is burning
Like an earth reclaimed
And I try
A final crusade
This world is changing
But I'm still the same

And will you be bold
Will you lose control?
I could never desert you
I could never let go
If you fall in line
And the zenith calls
I'm standing waiting

The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall

It's your magnetic hold
A gravity pull
I can feel you in waves
When your melody comes
It falls from above
I will not be afraid

The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
