Galloping through the morning dew,
There is only one thing that I want to do to you,
And its true that I'm going to do it soon.

Rory rory ride rory
Rory rory ride rory
Rory ride me slowly,
Ride me raw raw raw.

Stride on your back rocking to ride,
I got the feeling we're gonna gallop alright,
And It's true that I'm gonna do it soon.

Galloping through the morning dew,
There's only one thing I that I want to do to you,
And it's true, that I'm gonna to do it soon.
It'll take three to satisfy me,
'Cause I'm more of a man than you'll ever be.
Rory, ride me slowly, ride me true, ride me true.
