She said to me, would you like to be,
I got plenty of time, It's gonna take some time.

Ahhhh I'm hanging out.
I'm hanging out baby, I'm hanging out,
Ahhhh I'm hanging out.
I'm hanging out baby, I'm hanging out,
Ahhhh I'm hanging out,
Come on now, come along sing my song.

She said to me, we're gonna lie on the floor,
Cause we don't need to go and can choose some more.

I'm dying for something, oh what will it be,
I'm dying for you to do something to me.
