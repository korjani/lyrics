I'm a real bitch,
I'm a twisted witch,
I'll screw you around,
When your feeling down.

I wonder around with my nose in the air,
I bug all these losers, but I don't care,
They might think they're better than me,
But I'm gonna make them history.

I've been around I've done all I can,
I'll mess you a bud, I'll even steal your man,
I've tried to hard, been pushed too long,
Gonna put all you man where you belong.
