I've lived my life on the edge of a knife,
And I can't give it up.

In the fast lane of misery and pain,
And I can't give it up.

I've had a good time on the weeds and the wine,
And I can't give it up.

I've been up and down, below and above ground,
And I can't give it up,
And I can't give it up.

Better under the table than under the ground,
And I can't give it up.

I like what I take, but my life's a mistake,
And I can't give it up.

It all went wrong the day I was born,
And I can't give it up.

I've tried to invest, but my life was a mess,
And I can't give it up,
And I can't give it up.

It's hard to refuse, when there is nothing to lose,
And I can't give it up.

I need to drink more, cause my life's such a bore,
And I can't give it up.

I've had my fill and I made out my will,
And I can't give it up.

I drink all I can cause it makes me a man,
And I can't give it up,
And I can't give it up.
