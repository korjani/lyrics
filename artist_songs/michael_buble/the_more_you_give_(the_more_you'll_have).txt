It's that time of year I treasure
The time for giving, the best part of living
To celebrate with friends we hold so dear
Well, I can feel it in the air
All bundled head-to-toe
Too cold to bear, it's the best time of the year

I got my stocking, got my Christmas tree
Got my loved ones next to me

It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give, the more you'll have
The fire's bright now
And snow comes down
Grab your friends; hold them near
Christmas time is here
(Whoo!)

Every house on every corner
Stringing up the Christmas lights
People caroling, "O Christmas Tree"
"How you shine so bright for me"
Children 'round the world
Shouting "Santa's on his way"
Hoping to hear those sleigh bells ringing on his sleigh

I'm gonna wrap my arms around you tight
On this cold December night

It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give, the more you'll have
The fire's bright now
Snow's coming down
Grab your friends; hold them near
Christmas time is here

I hear his sleigh and I know the big guy's on his way
Man, I'm hoping he comes through
I hope he brings me you

Well, it's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give, the more you'll have
Well, the fire's bright now
And snow comes down
Grab your family; hold them near
Christmas time is here

Well, it's almost here
So spread some cheer (come on, baby)
Let's give love and get some back (come on, baby)
The more you give, the more you'll have (whoo-hoo!)
Well, the fire's bright now (you gotta, you gotta)
And snow comes down (you gotta, you gotta, you gotta)
Grab your family; hold them near
Christmas time is here (the more you give, the more you'll have)

Fire's burning bright
Hold me tight, baby
Just give it up, baby
Come on, baby
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give, the more you'll have
