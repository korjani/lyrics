Baby, I get a little bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
When I'm thinkin' on you
Maybe, I might get a little reckless
But ya gotta expect that
What else can a boy do?
My mamma taught me how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care
'Cause I want you, I need you all for me

And I don't want anybody, lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
And I don't want anybody, thinkin' just maybe
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

And I know, when you got a lovely lady
It might drive the boys crazy
When she's lookin' so fine, whooooaaahh
I know-know-know, no one would ever blame me
The only thing that could save me
Is just knowing you're mine
My papa told me, once or twice
Don't be cruel but don't be too nice
'Cause I want you, I need you all for me

'Cause I don't want anybody, lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
And I don't want anybody, thinkin' just maybe
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

(Hey!)
(Nobody, nobody)
(Hey!)
(Nobody, nobody)

I know, I can be a bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
I'm so in love with you

I don't want anybody, lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
I don't want anybody, lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

Ooh my papa told me once or twice
Don't be cruel, don't be too nice (nobody, nobody)
My baby needs no lines from me
Whoaaah, and I know how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care (nobody, nobody)
My baby don't need no one but me-eee-eeee
