Keep twisting the kaleidoscope of colors
With every turn my body tumbles
These feelings adhere to others
Late day rain gon' make more puddles
Won't let them take away what's locked in my fist
It's the purr from the makeshift skiff along with the bathwater mist
Float some more this boat won't tip no no
The reflection of the blue sky hits the green sea
See it all into my city
If my heart stops to beat at least I'll have what I've seen
Gotta defend this for my life
Gotta save it from the shade and make it shine up in the light
Gotta make it mine
And keep it in storage before the whole ocean gets swallowed up by the storm

[Chorus:]
Don't step up in my way again
Cause I'll take it, cause I'll take it wrong
Don't step up in my way again
Cause you'll have it, cause you'll have it
Don't step up in my way again
Cause I'll take it, cause I'll take it wrong
Don't step up in my way again
Cause you'll have it, you'll have it on you

I'm living through new experiences
I'm tense only when I think about it
I'm drunk off palms and picket fences
Clean conscience from that as a shower
Main grove, old stones, capos, just singing sweet songs
Outside drinking calling shots
Sunrise I won't fall
Tide goes in, tide goes out sometimes I wish I could forget about the way it used to be
But today is new for me
And I'm loose in it, yeah yeah
Touch the water before you dive into the reef (dive into the reef, dive into the reef)
Good rest without it
Blow out the window along with the breeze

[Chorus]
