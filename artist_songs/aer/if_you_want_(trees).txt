Yo! New Kicks! (Where'd you get them bro)
At Bodega, stay repping FAM you already know, (Where the money from)
Pushing product to your pocket that'll make you rocket off, never stoppin'
Cuz I know you heard from her that I got that shh
Keep it on the down low if you're tryna pack good
If the quantity's got me impressed, I'll ride
I travel for nothing less than a slice unless a ten's tryna cop a dime
Scheming some high stakes plans they stay opaque
Reupping before the weekend come I bet the flip'll take, how long?
About an hour, why?, it's cuz it's sour
Kingpin I come to win, she just alleviate the power

[Carter:]
I'm making plays all day, can't hang
Which crab's gonna get a bag full of shake
Green slick whipping, no slip ups or mistakes
This is just one of the couple ways I'm out getting paid

[David:]
If you want trees!
I'll be there for ya, phones blowin' up got another order
If you want trees!
Tell me where your dorms at, 20 for the daps, yup thats the format

[Carter:]
Nobody is capable of moving or shape shifting like me, that's why I'm at the top
Got kid's clogging up my spot, betting on a quick fix, well as long as it's bought
No explanation for the neighbors, if she's coming I can save her, half of what I'm lighting, celebration of the majors
That personal stash to the side, you in debt, I'm all right, it's that green, it saves lives, I'm around, just give it a try

[Carter:]
Hopping over fences, mending every sentence so that I can keep this cover hidden
(But you're on fire)
Man I know that but I gotta keep my head level enough to be controlled yeah
(I like your style)
Well thanks, but thank me when you've unpacked that Armageddon dank
(You're on my speed dial)
I appreciate it, tell your friends I got a question for them just like this

[David:]
If you want trees!
I'll be there for ya, phones blowin' up got another order
If you want trees!
Tell me where your dorms at, 20 for the daps, yup thats the format

[David:]
Since '09 we just been grindin' dimes and bags of dro kid
I get fly cause my assignment is to kill these shows
Some people don't know how
Fresh top to bottom we just don't, give a fuck about your style

[David:]
Yeah, FAM movement, its like that, the bright side, sup Roo?
Aye Griff, Miggz, hold my coat
