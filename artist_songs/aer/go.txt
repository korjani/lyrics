Get Out, Get Out, Get Out, Get Out
Get Out, Get Out, Get Out, Get Out
Get Out, Get Out, Get Out, Get Out
Get Out, Get Out, Get Out, Get Out

[Carter:]
Yo, we all know every minute longer that you remain in your sheets
You're giving a lit up Olympic torch to your competition to beat ya
No buts or ums, cuz that ain't fun,
Finally hear your feet knockin on the floor of your room
Now learn a new task, become a maven
Then give it a couple weeks of training you just need dedication
I'm who moves the roosters from the coop to get you up and at em'
Saturday morning doing shit you couldn't ever fathom
You got ideas then do something
Instead of worrying bout who the fuck is looking just keep it movin
So my brothers and my sisters, everyone in the FAM
Can be bold, stand out and yell
"Fuck the plan!"

Don't, give it up, give it up if you put it down
I can do this till' I'm dead's how it should sound,
If you pressin' snooze, you bout to lose
I'ma bust down the door, open up my mouth and start yellin to ya.

[Chorus - David:]
Get out
Get outta bed and step out
Just live above and stick out
Cuz we got your back
Yea, We got you
Get out
Get outta bed and step out
Just live above and stick out
Cuz we got your back
Yea, We got you

[Carter:]
Ten eighties came in and greatly increased my productivity
Give me a reason you're ain't trying that yourself, bro
You gotta be kidding me
Mathletes, track meets, artsy girls all bumpin this song
Fuck yo clique if you think this shit won't stick, you happen to be wrong
I'm comin' up on that dream while you watch TV
You were born with the power so why not succeed?
I wasn't built in a day, yea you better believe
Even on stilts you don't look down on me
Erase the boundaries
Put by yourself
Step out the comfort zone
It's for your health
Without askin, the answer's no
It's the fam that can hand you the plan to own

Don't, give it up, give it up if you put it down
I can do this till' I'm dead's how it should sound
If you pressin' snooze, you bout to lose
I'ma bust down the door, open up my mouth and start yellin to ya.

[Chorus - David:]
Get out
Get outta bed and step out
Just live above and stick out
Cuz we got your back
Yea, We got you
Get out
Get outta bed and step out
Just live above and stick out
Cuz we got your back
Yea, We got you
