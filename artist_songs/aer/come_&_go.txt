[Carter:]
A bit more time till I get that sign that tells me I can go
Evolution the solution, heres some tickets to my show
Escape this in case you can’t identify my flow
Gotta wake up and make my take of this forsaken word
Fitted cap on ready to get my night on
A-life grey covering’ up my toes, feline’ double oh seven
Sneaking up in the darkness, showin’ up is the hardest
I’m alarming, the door kicks open
I see my boys and some kush gettin’ smoked in
In and out the door, ate a bit, refrigerator with the 40s
Priority of tonight is unite us

[Dave:]
Hear the rhythm and bump
Fall in love with the funk
Let us hand off the vibe to you
Hands up high if you want it
Give me nothin’ I’ma write a song
Give a shit what outsider’s on
Never have and I won’t stop
You can tell me anything you want

[Carter:]
Even, thinkin’ about, and drinkin’ that
Shit from last night, I can’t do it
Weak stomach, spendin’ cash on the rum and the drugs
Even if the stocks have plummeted
To the ground, compensation with a good time
And it sounds like you gotta go, no more time for me
It’s like a rhino muy thai fighting a freak
But then I jolt awake, bout to break, headache stronger than the power of fate
And I remember back, it goes
1 shot, 2 shot, 3 shot, all the way to ten like Lil Jon’s living in the back of my head
Then the blackening begins, sins were happenin’ like the rapture being captured again

One, two, three
Scream out loud
Fighting for you
I said we fight for the youth
(The Reach, aha! Yeah!)
