[Dave:]
You like the feel I bring

[Carter:]
Block out haters, embrace my behavior
My music'll be your savior, later maybe later
I can sing something for ya
Deliver it to your door then
Spread positive vibrations that's what I'm about
Take my phone, click remote
Then you control the Bob Marley that can continuously flow
Through the amp, go to my hand
We sittin' in my backyard
Forgetting that life can be hard

[Dave:]
You like the feel I bring
(Run out to the rope and hope you hit the water cold
So you can soak in the kaleidoscope)

The heat brings out my aura
Sends me out the door
I'm moving forward either way
Pass out on the floor
I'm waking up for more
Then falling asleep again
You like the feel I bring

[Carter:]
Gettin high with my guys slappin high fives
Step aside I ain't sittin on the sidelines
Say what's good if you see me fly by
Feel I bring my vibes get you bye high
Rep a side get denied simmer down now
Listen up to my lyrics get a shout out
Sname run the game and Piffs gettin with it
Glove pass the bong to Coop to rip it
