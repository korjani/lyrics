[David:]
So come with me, some rum and tree,
Hands in the air I don't plan on nothing,
Heavy with doubt I'mma lift you to the ceiling, come around,
It's a new day!

[Carter:]
Been hitting the stage at a teen age, I'm stepping out of this phase,
Surveying the land around me, picking at herbal blends and sage,
I got the FAM helping me, taking the game over stealthily,
Looking for clues that'll lead me to ladies, who'll come to the house with me,
We go by rollers, buyers, I'm at the front of a long line and I know,
This is where that I'm meant to be, splitting leaves, fill it with trees now,
You gotta breath out, relax now!

[Carter:]
It's quick in evicting the shittiness isn't it?
Flicking the stick in a tray never middie's kid, (you never know!)
I'm thinking of gripping this business, that FAM shit,
Can't miss this, no longer gonna be restless,

[David:]
So come with me, some rum and tree,
Hands in the air I don't plan on nothing,
Heavy with doubt I'mma lift you to the ceiling, come around,
It's a new day!

[Carter:]
Tryna stop this heavy fronting, right now, no more questions,
Thought I wasn't cool at first, but now I've got them second guessing,
Finna sip water on the moon, but the problem's not the reach,
I'mma fly to the bright side, a bag of that green's what you need,
Wayland High's got something in the water, it's been steady spewing stars,
George Guest on the back of Sammy Adams breathing Fresh Aer, now we in charge,

New day, next try, life long, that's right, I wanna climb without a fall at all,

[David:]
So come with me, some rum and tree,
Hands in the air I don't plan on nothing,
Heavy with doubt I'mma lift you to the ceiling, come around,
It's a new day!

[Carter:]
It's the time, that we go, never stop, go for the gold
I've been waiting for this day, for so long
