Alright enough fucking around
I don't got the time to sit down
Gotta keep pushing and reaching for the clouds
The top is gonna deliver the rock infused the rap and the hip hop
Styling of new music that'll suck you in to the sitcom of our life
Episode in South Carolina imploding my mind
With the types and the thoughts of the southern women I get lost in it
Withering away the cold weather today, ya see me?

Fraternity brothers are giving us one color green
In the form of weed, I'll smoke while they're chasing diplomacy
I'm gonna get the money you owe to me, solo in the fleet
Photoshoot in the sea, tides pull back on the water
We'll wonder the sidewalks of a broken city
I can't honestly believe where I've come and where I'm gonna be after two more weeks fuckin with the reach

[Chorus:]
Yeah get it with the movement
Come and join us for the ride [x2]

I been spendin' time blowin' out all these ghosts
And with no lies you can knock on my door
Fresh Aer keeps you livin the moment
Singin' bout the want for the greater love
Rollin' one back to the left side
Rollin' one back right side
Rollin' one back to the left side
Rollin' one back right side
