[Hook x2:]
Can you, can you keep it, oh yeah
Can you keep it coming round
Can you, can you keep it, oh yeah
You left me something I could sing about

Friday night, no parents
Gonna be at her crib
So maybe we can sit out on the terrace
And sip on the drink, but either way
I'll be gone for the night
Laying down, feeling alright
Your silence is cut by Pilot Talk on the speakers
Hooking up and untying her sneakers
Taking off my new t-shirt
She want to turn off the lights but then I can't see her
Before I say I'm down to play some more
My phone's off, the clock says to start the tour
Of the body, the life inside the mind
Connected in sections of the brain but outside
I can see that she's into me
Digging the feeling I'm givin' her like the Boston symphony
But that shit's too sweet
I'm just passing through underneath the sheets

Can you, can you keep it

Let me ride you
Summertime on through
Wintertime and do it all
Freezing fingers outside, it's on me
See the breath of a liar leave my chest

[Hook x2:]
Can you, can you keep it, oh yeah
Can you keep it coming round
Can you, can you keep it, oh yeah
You left me something I could sing about

She gonna see I'm-a that guy
Coma the floor, no bed
I'll assign myself to the betterin' of tonight
The veteran of this crime
I fill my cup up with somethin'
Foam with a bit of lime
I wanna skip the fine dine
Maybe after high times
If your friends come by
Maneuver as our bodies are fuming from accumulating relations
After conversation
Full body elation
And it comes and it goes
And we both know it won't last long
So we gotta roll with it while we can
Never whip up in her hand
Never rip up a too talented eye kind of man
Like me, coming up from the MA
On the up and up and open up an account in her name
I'm just playin', babe
I don't have the type of money to be playing with the game
