I surround this side of town
With the mouth getting down looking at the ground
When the bass touch her face she start that sound, sound
She blaming the kush that we lit up
Once I began to land to get it up
She ran with this hand on the wood I set out
Cause it feels so good
Unzip my zip and dip your head below
And I sip, I rip, we kiss, blow the L and go
And I roll, yeah, I get it so yeah
And off away I'll send her away by the end of the day
I'll be waving to that ho

[Hook x2]
I said, I, I, I'm gonna take your girl
And I'mma show her a side of a different world
And I'mma fuck your girlfriend till she never ever come back home, oh

I'mma get what she got
Whether she's single or not
No flaws just a ten
From the bottom to the top, yeah
Driving through the roadblocks, summer sun so hot
Lips on the blow pop
She got my eye
Now I'm on lock
Gotta drop my drink and stare
She got my attention so well
Shit I was scared
And if you got a boyfriend you better leave him
At least let me join in for a threesome
I'm just kidding girl but you don't need him
Is this him?
Okay yo check it out

[Hook x2]
I said, I, I, I'm gonna take your girl
And I'mma show her a side of a different world
And I'mma fuck your girlfriend till she never ever come back home, oh

I said I, I, I, I'm singing this bitch for you
I said I, I, I, I won't fuck it up cause it's for you
