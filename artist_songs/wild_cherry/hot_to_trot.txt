(Stand back)
I see you standin' over there
Just checkin' me out

(Stand back)
What'cha lookin' for honey?
What'cha comin' on strong about?

(Stand back)
I might be too much for ya honey
Do ya know what I mean?

(Stand back)
I'm just a dancin' fool
And I'm lookin' for a struttin' queen

One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not

I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot

(Stand back)
You better step aside, baby
This ain't your scene

(Stand back)
I'm coming for you on on my feet
So you better hang on to your genie

(Stand back)
You better leave me alone
Because I need to spend 'em on the floor

(Stand back)
You're taking one hell of a chance
Just hanging out in store for more

One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not

I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot

(I want you to listen while the Cherry Brothers tell you all about it)

When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot

(Stand back)
You ain't got no style
You're no match for me

(Stand back)
You're just a lead foot mama
It's so easy to see

(Stand back)
You know you just can't dance
Hear what I say

(Stand back)
Until you learn how to do it,
Better come back another day

One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not

I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot

Bye Bye
Hey Cherry Brothers, tell them one more time

When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
