Don't want no cloudy morning
Won't you hear what I say?
There won't be no tomorrow
If you're not with me today
I won't live without you
I don't need to be free
It's your sweet sweet, love I need
And now it's easy to see

I know there's been times when I should not have left behind
All the things that you said
But being a man makes it hard to understand
How a woman gets mislead
And if I ever blow this thing
I got to have myself shot
Of all the people in the whole wide world
You're the best friend I got

Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Hey, come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Ooh, come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Ooh yeah

Life has its problems, I know I've got my share
Put them all together honey, wouldn't come close to you not there
Where could I go now? Tell me, what could I do?
Everything I live and breathe is automatically you

Sometimes I sit and think of all the stupid things
I've said and done to you, babe
It never crossed my mind until the moment that I tell you
What a fool I've been made
Don't go, baby, don't go, baby doll
Let's give it one more try
Hold me tight, don't let me go
Help me take away these tears that I cried

Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Ooh, come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Ooh yeah

Oh yeah...

Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Yeah, come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me

Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
(Come on baby)
Come on, take your time, don't you ever leave me
Hold on
