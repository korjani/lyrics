Lost and afraid
Young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is
The easier it scars your soul
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something
Don't let me go

Up and away, I'm an alien
I need a moment
I don't know what to believe
All I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make you see
Make you need me?
Maybe I won't ever know
Maybe I'll end up alone
Running in place
Circles, in circles with you
Don't mind me
Out in the rain
I didn't mean to be here
Watch me go

I don't wanna let you down
So promise you won't let me drown

How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside my head?
I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions
About how I need to handle the stress
I'm acting all funny because of the money
It's making my tummy upset

How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside my head?
I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me and fast
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions and paying the rent
Emotions and paying the rent

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati—
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati—
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati—
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati—
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
