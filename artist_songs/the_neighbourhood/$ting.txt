I tried to be someone
I lied to be someone else... for you
If I had done something a little bit differently
We would've moved in a better direction than this, baby

If you were human
If you were who I assumed you were
You wouldn't have done this
I thought I did something
But she would do anything to bring me down
And she brought me down

You say that you love me
But you act like you don't
You used to adore me
Laughed at all of my jokes
Don't take this the wrong way
You put me in harm's way

When we had our first kiss it was your favorite thing
And you weren't lying when you said it would sting
Don't take this the wrong way
You put me in harm's way

Imagine our children
How fucked would they be?
Mommy's a psycho
Daddy lives in a dream
Don't take this the wrong way

I told you I'm sorry
Couldn't thank you enough
I thought that I loved you but
We weren't in love
We weren't in love

You were my dream
The way we would fuck
You liked to think
We would push through the bad
Ignoring the problems just to hold what we had
Don't take this the wrong way
Don't take this the wrong way
