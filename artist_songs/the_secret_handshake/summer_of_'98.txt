I wrote some songs cause I love her
Then played some shows in the suburbs
It was the middle of summer in Texas
I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked out at school then
I was feeling like a champ then, in summer

This this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this this could be the summer when I grow up

I wanted to be just like him
He looked just like all the cool kids
I wanted to wear what he wore in summer
I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked out at school then
I was feeling like champ then, in summer

ok

This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this this could be the summer when I grow up

Its never been like this
I am just starting over

Its never been like this
I am just starting over

This, this could be, the summer the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
