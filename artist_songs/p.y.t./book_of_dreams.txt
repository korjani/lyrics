Every night before I go to sleep
I open a book no one knows I keep
I hold my special secrets to myself
Things that I couldn't tell anybody else

[CHORUS:]
Memories in each and every line (each and every line)
Can't take that away from me (away)
Because you will always be
In my book of dreams (my book of dreams)
My hopes and memories
Takes us to a place in time 
Where the sun will always shine
My book of dreams (my book of dreams)
My lands of fantasy
I just close my eyes and fly
And I'll always have you in my
Book of dreams

I found a page I wrote when we first kissed
Now I know that there is no greater love than this
The words I wrote that are still true today
Remember I love you
In a perfect way

[REPEAT CHORUS]

So very real you see
Just like your love
Each page is a part of me

[REPEAT CHORUS]
