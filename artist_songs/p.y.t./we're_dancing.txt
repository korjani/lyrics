When the going starts to get rough
And you feel like you've had enough
Let the music take control of your soul
Take a chance and do what you feel
Your a force they cannot live without it
You gotta break the chain yeah yeah

There's a passion inside
An inner strength that drives
Can't nobody take that away from you
It's the greatest high
You set the floor on fire when you come alive

[Chorus:]
And we're dancin'
And it feels alright
I can't control my desire
And we're dancin'
And it feels alright
Yeah
And we're dancin'
And it feels alright
Can't hold me down
Gotta reach for the sky
And we're dancin' 
And it feels alright
Yeah

Some people don't know the love you possess
They pretend what they don't understand
It's natural
You're in a world of your own
Ohhhhh oh

There's a passion inside
An inner strength that drives
Can't nobody take that away from you
It's the greatest high
You set the floor on fire
When you come alive

[Repeat Chorus]

Push it too the max
Feel the room fall at your feet
Don't you dare hold back
Cuz it feels so good
Inside

There's a passion inside
An inner strength that drives
Can't nobody take that away from you
It's the greatest high you set the floor on fire
When you come alive

[Repeat Chorus]

And we're dancing
