Ah ohh ohh ohh
Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Oo Oo Oo Oo
Ah ah oh whoa

I've been waiting
Watching you from a distance baby 
Thinkin', wonderin'
If you're gonna be here with me
You're on my mind baby all the time
I hope someday you will realize that

[CHORUS:]
Sooner or later
You're gonna be mine
I want you forever 
I can't stop now
I wish you could love me
The way I love you
But sooner or later
I will get to you

Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Oo Oo Oo Oo
Ah ah oh whoa

Something tells me
That you and I should be together
So I won't wait
Run away to something better
You're on my mind baby all the time
I hope someday you will realize that

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I never thought that I could feel this way
(ohhhh)
So don't be afraid
I ain't gonna hurt you
I promise my love is truuuuuuuue

Sooner or later (sooner or later)
You're gonna be mine
I want you forever (I can't stop now no)
I wish you could love (wish you could love me)
But sooner or later
I will get to you

Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo Oo Oo Oo Oo
Ah ah oh whoa
