Baby, can I get your number?
I wonder if you wanna get with a real thing
Tell me what you need
I guarantee that I'll never do you wrong
So bring it on, my love is strong
Tell me what you want

I know that you're shy
But you caught my eye
You don't know what you do to me
Whenever you're around
I want you to know I'm down
I'll never let you go

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of
They say I'm too young for me to understand
About a man
Ain't no ifs or ands about it
I know how I feel about you
And I, boy I know that it's true
That I'm diggin' you
And all that I want is someone like you
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will

Baby, I know that I'm young
But I ain't dumb
Tell you exactly what I want in love
For me, and I...
(And I will never do those things to you)
(That other girls would do to you)

I know you're shy but won't you
Give me a chance and I'll show you
Whenever you come around
I want you to know I'm down
And I'll never let you go

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of
They say I'm too young for me to understand
About a man
Ain't no ifs or ands about it
I know how I feel about you
And I, boy I know that it's true
That I'm diggin' you
And all that I want is someone like you
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will

Break it down for me
Oh, oh oh oh (ah ah ah)
(Ain't no ifs or ands about it)
(I know how I feel about you and I)

I know, I know
That I'm young
I'd never do you wrong
(And I will never do those things to you)
(That other girls would do to you)

I don't know if it's love that I'm thinkin' of
They say I'm too young for me to understand
About a man
Ain't no ifs or ands about it
I know how I feel about you
And I, boy I know that it's true
That I'm diggin' you
And all that I want is someone like you
Ain't no ifs or ands about it baby
I know I'ma make you mine, and I will
