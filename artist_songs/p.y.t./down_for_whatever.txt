DFW
DFW

Me and my girls
Chillin' on the boulevard
Take a good look
You can see how fine we are
It's a hot night
We're lookin' air tight
Like movie stars
Lookin' for some fun
Lookin' for someone
Cuz this is where the good times are

Come on baby, let's go
(What's your pleasure?)
Is it hoppin' or slow?
You've just gotta know
PYT forever

[Chorus]

DFW
DFW
Down for whatever with PYT
DFW
DFW
Down for whatever with PYT

Out on the floor
Runnin' hot and looking cool
Down with the DJ....
