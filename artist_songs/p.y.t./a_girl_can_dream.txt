When I was a child the story would say
Somebody would sweep you off your feet someday
That's what I hoped would happen with you
More than you could know
I wanted to tell you that my heart's in your hands
I prayed for the day when I would get the chance
Just when I worked up the courage to try
Much to my surprise
You had somebody else
Cuz these feelings I keep to myself

[CHORUS:]
I may never get to hold you so tight
I may never get to kiss you goodnight
I may never get to look deep in your eyes
Or so it seems
I always will be wishing you were mine
I think about what could be all the time
All the happiness that I could find
Baby a girl can dream

From the moment I wake up
'Til I fall asleep 
I imagine you not with her but with me
Talkin' and laughin'
Sharin' our dreams
It's just a fantasy
Cuz you had somebody else
Cuz these feelings I keep to myself 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

A girl can dream it's true
And to call you my own
Is the sweetest dream of all

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Oh a girl can dream
