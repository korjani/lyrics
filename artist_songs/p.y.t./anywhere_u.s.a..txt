Everywhere we go we see you
We feel the energy you've given back to us
We've traveled many miles to be with you
And we'll do it again just because
Because between us theres no distance
Even though we come from many worlds apart
It really doesn't make a difference 
Anyway anyhow where we are
Being here with you this way
Reminds us of a place

[CHORUS:]
Anywhere USA
No matter where we go
London Paris Rome
It feels like
Anywhere USA
It never to feels too far away from home

From home ooh anywhere

Everybody's got a bad bone
Let's get together raise the roof right off this house
We speak the language, the same one
Isn't that what it's all about
Being here with you this way
Reminds of us a place

[CHORUS:]
Anywhere USA
No matter where we go
London, Paris Rome
It feels like
Anywhere USA
It never to feels too far away from home

From hoooooooome

Anywhere USA
No matter where we go
New York Tokyo
It feels like 
Anywhere USA
It never feels too far away from home

Do what we're saying
When the groove is playing
Keep it moving cause you'll never want to stop
This is what we have together
Ohh can't get no better
Anywhere is home when you got what we've got

Anywhere (Anywhere)
Anywhere (Anywhere)
Anywhere (Anywhere USA)

We're goin' Tokyo or New York City, 
Canada Paris Miami
We raise the roof, we're PYT
Rock the world we're all family
Anywhere is home when you got what we got
Kick back relax until we hit your spot
Boston, DC, LA, and Philly, Bombay
Anywhere USA

Hey hey hey hey hey anywhere USA

No matter where we go

It feels like
Anywhere USA
It never to feels too far away from home

Hey hey hey hey hey anywhere USA
