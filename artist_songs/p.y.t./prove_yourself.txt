If you really want me babe
Prove yourself to me

Straight up (uh huh)
Get real (alright)
Just tell me what you feel yeah
Wise up (uh huh)
Be true
If it's gonna be just me and you

Let's wait a while and think it over (think it over)
I don't know why you behave this way (mmmm yeah)
Don't you think that I know you
And all the things you say
This is what you gotta do
You gotta change your ways
Wise up
Step back
If you want this love to last

[CHORUS:]
Prove yourself to me boy
I think you're movin', movin' way too fast now
Prove yourself to me boy
Come on and get real
Show me what you're feelin'
Cuz if you really want me babe
Prove yourself to me

Straight up (uh huh)
Get real (alright)
Just tell me what you feel yeah
Wise up (uh huh)
Be true
If it's gonna be just me and you

Stop fooling around 
And make your mind up (make your mind up, make your mind up)
It's about time you give me some space (ohhh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Don't you think that I know you
And all the things you say
This is what you gotta do
You gotta change your ways
Wise up 
Step back
If you want this love to last

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Straight up (uh huh)
