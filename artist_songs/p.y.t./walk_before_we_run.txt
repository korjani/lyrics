Ohhhhh

I see that look of passion
All in your eyes
Late at night you'v been creepin'
To my surprise
Better get your heart in check
You better realize
My feelings can't be tampered with
We might have to cut the ties
We don't know just how far
We could go
Only time will tell
Is it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
We better be sure
Is it no no no no no

[CHORUS:]
Baby let's walk before we run (walk before we run)
Takin' it slow is half the fun (take it slow)
Because this feeling's just begun (ohh)
Baby let's walk before we run
Walk before we run

You say you're dyin' for what your body needs
Don't wanna lead you on
I don't want no people teased
But I like the way you're playing
That old school game
I don't want this thing to be the same old same
We don't know just how far we cold go
Only time will tell
Is it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Time will tell
Is it no no no no no

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x's]

Baby if we rush
The moment that we touch
We might get swept away
And if hesitate
It still won't be too lat
And then I know you'll stay

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Baby let's walk before we run (walk before we run)
Takin' it slow is half the fun (ohh, take it slow)
Because this feeling's just begun
Baby let's walk 
Baby let's walk 
Baby let's walk
