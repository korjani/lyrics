We swore our love forever
And stick always together
(yeah ohhhhhhhhh) (uh huh)

[CHORUS:]
Love is a 
Love is a 
Love is a most simple thing
But you're never gonna make it
If you're gonna fake it

The first time we met
We shared equal respect
How far do you have to go until you forget
We started as lovers
With devotion and love
Now the chance it broken
Life's tough

I tried to tell you boy you're not right for me
When you cheat on me with every girl you see
Just give it up
You're sorry please
Cuz it's not meant to be
If you want me boy 
I'm afraid you've lost my sympathy

Don't look back just go for what's ahead of you
Don't look back I've go a different point of view
Don't look back just go for what's ahead of you
Don't look back I've got a different point of view

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I'd rather know the painful truth
Than a soothing lie
Life's much too short
So please except my goodbye
There's no turning back
Please don't even try
You've just gone too far
You've gambled too high

You played your games on me
Playing with my heart
Didn't care about me
That was tearing me apart
I'm through with it
The only one I should really love
That is me, myself but really that's in love boy

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Don't look back just go for what's ahead of you
Don't look back I've go a different point of view
Don't look back just go for what's ahead of you
Don't look back I've got a different point of view

When you find yourself alone
Feeling stronger on your own
And you're looking into the unknown
That's when you've finally grown

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Life's much too short so please except my goodbye
