I see your album in the Billboard
Your video's on TRL
We haven't spoken since the springtime
You got my number and your cell
I remember all the sweet times
It wasn't very long ago
And now you've gone and hit the big time
I don't wanna let you go
I want you (you)
To talk to (to)
You know I miss you oh so much
I wanna hear your voice (wanna hear your voice)
Baby keep in touch (call me any)

[CHORUS:]
Call me anytime
I've got you on my mind (my heart is on the line)
My heart is on the line (call me call me)
I want you to be mine
Call me anytime
I'm waiting on the line (waiting on the line)
Hit me one more time (baby one more baby one more)
I want you to be mine (want you to be mine)

I know you've got my number
I'm waiting
Call me anytime

I ain't drivin' with nobody else
It's time we break it down to real (to real)
Don't wanna put my heart up on the shelf
I don't think I have to tell you how I feel (to feel)
I hope to see you 'round the way soon
Not just in a magazine
Get back to where we left off 
And wake me from this dream
I want you (you)
To talk to (to)
You know I miss you oh so much
I wanna hear your voice (wanna hear your voice)
Baby keep in touch (call me any)

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Call me anytime
I'm waiting on the line
I want you to be mine (be mine)
Call me anytiiiiiiiiiiime

Call me anytime 
I've got you on my mind (and I miss you)
My love is on the line
I want you to be mine (want you to be mine)
Call me anytime (call me baby)
I'm waiting on the line (anytime)
Hit me one more time
I want you to be mine
Call me anytime 
You know what
Call me anytime
I've got you on my mind
I wanna hear your voice
Please keep in touch
Call me
Call me
Call me anytime
