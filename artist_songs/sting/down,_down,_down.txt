Strange, when you leave me, rain comes down, down, down.
When you withdraw from me, towers come tumbling down, down, down.

Here comes the sound that I've been waiting for,
The sound that tells me when you're walking out my door.

Rob me blind, defenseless, my heart sinks down, down, down.
I can't wave, I'm drowning and sinking fast, down, down, down, down.

Here comes the sound I've been expecting all these years,
Here comes the sound of everything I've ever feared,
Here comes the sound, the floors below me disappear,
Here comes the sound, I force my fingers in my ears.

I'm drinking from this bitter cup,
The only place that's left is up,
I could not fall no further than this, down, down, down, down.

Here comes the sound of someone crying in the rain,
Here comes the sound of someone pouring out their pain.

All lines of communication, down, down, down, down.
My forces in retreat and running from this battleground.

Here comes the sound I've never heard before,
The sound that tells me when you're walking out my door.
Here comes the sound of someone calling out for aid,
Here comes the sound of someone falling.
