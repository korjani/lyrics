Optimists say,
The future's just a place we've never been.
Histories say,
We're doomed to make the same mistakes again.

Between the two I can't decide,
Really I must choose a side.
I guess I’ll wake up smarter,
One fine day.

Apologists say,
The weather's just a cycle we can't change.
Scientists say,
We've pushed those cycles way beyond.

Dear leaders, please do something quick,
Time is up, the planet’s sick.
But hey, we'll all be grateful,
One fine day?

Today the North West Passage just got found,
Three penguins and a bear got drowned,
The ice they lived on disappeared,
Seems things are worse than some had feared.

...It's progress of a kind,
Who knows what else we're going to find?
So do you trust your head or heart,
When things all seem to fall apart?
I guess we'll wake up smarter,
One fine day.

Today it's raining dogs and cats,
Rabbits jumping out of hats,
And now what's got us all agog,
Tomorrow it's a plague of frogs.
We must do something quick or die,
When snakes can talk and pigs will fly,
And we'll all be so much wiser,
One fine day...
