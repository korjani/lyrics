How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?

How many lonely, sleepless nights 
How many lies, how many fights 
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?

"Love is pain," I hear you say 
Love has a cruel and bitter way 
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain

How could it be that what you need the most 
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking 
Through an old book in rainy weather 
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together 
You could be walking down the street 
And who should you chance to meet 
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money 
We're starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back 
I'm thinking in a brand new way 

Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her 
Starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across 
Started up a brand new day

It could happen to you - just like it happened to me 
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it 
And sometimes no reflection is there

Baby wait a minute, wait a minute 
Wait a minute, wait a minute 
Wait a minute, wait a minute 

Turn the clock to zero, honey 
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money 
We're starting up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero, Mac 
I'm begging her to take me back 
I'm thinking in a brand new way 

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across 
Started up a brand new day 

Turn the clock to zero buddy 
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy 
Started up a brand new day

I'm the rhythm in your tune 
I'm the sun and you're the moon 
I'm a bat and you're the cave 
You're the beach and I'm the wave 
I’m the plow and you’re the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station 
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl 
Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Starting up a brand new day

I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I’m the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train

Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl 
Stand up all you lovers in the world 
Starting up a brand new day

You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We'll go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
