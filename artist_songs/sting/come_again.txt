Come again! sweet love doth now invite 
Thy graces that refrain 
To do me due delight, 
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, 
With thee again in sweetest sympathy. 

Come again! that I may cease to mourn 
Through thy unkind disdain; 
For now left and forlorn 
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die 
In deadly pain and endless misery. 

All the day the sun that lends me shine 
By frowns doth cause me pine 
And feeds me with delay; 
Her smiles, my springs that makes my joy to grow, 
Her frowns the winter of my woe. 

All the night my sleeps are full of dreams, 
My eyes are full of streams. 
My heart takes no delight
