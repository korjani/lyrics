We rode all night across an endless desert
We had no moon to light our way
And though a million stars were slowly turning
We lacked the consciences to pray

Our horses running like a devil chase us
Their feet, they hardly touched the ground
Yes, I'm familiar with a grey wolf howling
But I'm certain I never heard that sound
Devil to pay on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?
This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

I've been the lowest of the low on the planet
I've been a sinner all my days
When I was living with my hand on the trigger
I had no sense to change my ways
The preacher asked if I'd embrace the resurrection
To suck the poison from my life
Just like an existential cowboy villain
His words were balanced on my knife
Devil to pay, on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?

This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

Every night
Every night
All my distances afar

This cowboy song, is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
This cowboy song, this cowboy life
I'll be your dog-star shining tonight

Dog-star...
