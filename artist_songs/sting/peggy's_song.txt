Ye promised me my Jackie,
On the day that we got married,
Ye'd build a boat of dreams for me someday.

A vague romantic notion,
That we'd sail off to some ocean,
But in my dreams we'd get there one fine day.

He hasn't been the same since the yard closed down,
Like all the other men in this broken town,
He'd end up by the river as his thoughts turned black,
I said, "Pull yourself together pet, and come home, Jack."

Whenever we had sorrows,
We'd always say tomorrow,
We'd catch that ship of dreams and sail away.

What happened to my Jackie?
That big bold man I married?
It's hard to watch your fellow waste away.

He sits and stares at nothing,
That chair's an upright coffin,
The cat's got his tongue and there's nothing I can say.

He's never been the same since the yard got closed,
But he's dressed every morning in his working clothes,
Cuppa tea and a sandwich from his old rucksack,
But it never should've happened to a man like Jack.

If I came into money,
It'd be all for you, me honey,
And we'd build that ship of dreams and sail away.
