I sat down and wrote this letter
Telling you that I felt better
Since you've gone and I was free
I'm so happy

I have so little time to spare now
I'm wanted almost everywhere now
I make out like Casanova
Friends are always coming over

I signed my name as if I meant it
And sealed it with a kiss and sent it
The letter headed through my mood
Happy in my solitude

But halfway home I changed my tune
And when I saw my lonely room
The mirror caught my eye
When I sat down, I cried

Big lie, small world
It was a big lie, small world

I had to intercept that letter
Telling you that I was better
I raced to catch the postman's van
He was leaving as I ran

I missed the bus, I missed the train
I end up walking in the rain
Big dog chased me down the street
Hadn't had a bite to eat

Feeling sorry for myself
And wishing I was someone else
I walked across the city
Because I couldn't stand your pity

Big lie, small world
It was a big lie, small world

The place you live looks opulent
And obviously a higher rent
Than a cozy little room
I had this sense of doom

Your landlord says you're out of town
But your new boyfriend's always around
The hour was getting late
So I sit down and wait

Here's the postman with my letter
Coming down the path he better
Give that thing to me
I have to make him see

Begging doesn't do the trick
He thinks that I'm a lunatic
But then who comes upon the scene
But your new boyfriend, Mr. Clean

I hit the postman, hit your lover
Grabbed the letter, ran for cover
The police arrived in time for tea
They said they'd like to question me

But I can only curse my fate
I had to face the magistrate
It hasn’t been the best of days
I'd like to fly away

Big lie, small world
Big lie, small world
It was a big lie, small world
Big lie, small world
