I can't stand it for another day
When you live so many mile away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay
You took me over, let me find a way

I sold my house, I sold my motor, too
All I want is to be next to you
I'd rob a bank, maybe steal a plane
You took me over, think I'll go insane

What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you

I had a thousand girls or maybe more
But I never felt like this before
I just don't know what come over me
You took me over, take a look at me now

What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you

I saw the doctor, he said, "Give it time, son"
I got a feeling gonna lose my mind
When all it is is just a love affair
You took me over, baby, take me there

What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
Next to you
Next to you
Next to you
Next to you
Next to you
