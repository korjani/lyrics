Always this winter child, 
December's sun sits low against the sky 
Cold light on frozen fields, 
The cattle in their stable lowing. 

When two walked this winter road, 
Ten thousand miles seemed nothing to us then, 
Now one walks with heavy tread 
The space between their footsteps slowing 

All day the snow did fall, 
What's left of the day is close drawn in, 
I speak your name as if you'd answer me, 
But the silence of the snow is deafening 

How well do I recall our arguments, 
Our logic owed no debts or recompense, 
Philosophy and faith were ghosts 
That we would chase until 
The gates of heaven were broken 

But something makes me turn, I don't know, 
To see another's footsteps there in the snow, 
I smile to myself and then I wonder why it is 
You only cross my mind in winter
