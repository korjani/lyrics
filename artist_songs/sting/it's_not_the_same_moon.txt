Did you ever hear the theory of the universe?
Where every time you make a choice,
A brand new planet gets created?

Did you ever hear that theory?
Does it carry any sense?
That a choice can split the world in two,
Or is it all just too immense for you?

That they all exist in parallel,
Each one separate from the other,
And every subsequent decision,
Makes a new world then another,
And they all stretch out towards infinity,
Getting further and further away.

Now, were a man to reconsider his position,
And try to spin the world back to its original state?

It's not a scientific proposition,
And relatively speaking...you're late.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And these are different stars,
And these are different constellations,
From the ones that you've described.

Different rules of navigation,
Strange coordinates and lines,
A completely different zodiac,
Of unfamiliar signs.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And those planets are misleading,
I wouldn't even try to take a bearing or a reading,
Just accept that things are different,
You've no choice but to comply,
When smarter men have failed to see,
The logic as to why.

It's not the same moon,
It's not the same moon,
In the sky.
