Fine knacks for ladies, cheap, choice, brave and new, 
Good pennyworths but money cannot move, 
I keep a fair but for the fair to view, 
A beggar may be liberal of love. 
Though all my wares be trash, the heart is true. 

Great gifts are guiles and look for gifts again, 
My trifles come as treasures from my mind, 
It is a precious jewel to be plain, 
Sometimes in shell the Orient's pearls we find. 
Of others take a sheaf, of me a grain. 

Within this pack pins, points, laces and gloves, 
And divers toys fitting a country fair, 
But in my heart, where duty serves and loves, 
Turtles and twins, Court's brood, a heav'nly pair. 
Happy the man that thinks of no removes.
