In darkness let me dwell; the ground shall sorrow be, 
The roof despair, to bar all cheerful light from me; 
The walls of marble black, that moist'ned still shall weep; 
My music, hellish jarring sounds, to banish friendly sleep. 
Thus, wedded to my woes, and bedded in my tomb, 
O let me dying live, till death doth come, till death doth come. 

In darkness let me dwell
