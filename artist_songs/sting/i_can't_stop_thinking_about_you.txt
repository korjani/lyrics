White page, an empty field of snow,
My room is 25 below,
This cold pen chasing ghosts,
A road lies underneath the buried posts.
Dogs search the under forest,
We scour the empty streets,
The fact remains until we find you,
Our lives are incomplete.

Do I hear laughter through a veil of snow and ice?
Where could you be on such a lonely Winter's night?

I can't stop thinking about you,
I can't stop wanting you this way.
I can't face living without you,
That's why I'm searching night and day.
This heart's a lonely hunter,
These hands are frozen fists.
I can't stop thinking about you,
I don't care if you exist.

Do I hear laughter from behind this veil of midnight?
What are you hiding in the frozen heart of Winter?
Somewhere a church bell tolls,
I know you're close, your scent's still warm, 
and then the trail turns cold, cold, cold.

I can't stop thinking about you,
I can't stop wanting you this way.
I can't face living without you,
That's why I'm searching night and day.
This heart's a lonely hunter,
These hands are frozen fists.
I can't stop thinking about you,
I don't care if you exist.

Do I hear laughter in the silence of the snow?
I know you're hiding in this frozen heart of Winter.
A midnight church bell tolls,
I know you're close, your scent's still warm, 
and then the trail turns cold, cold, cold.

I can't stop thinking about you,
I can't stop wanting you this way.
I can't face living without you,
That's why I'm searching night and day.
This heart's a lonely hunter,
These hands are frozen fists.
I can't stop thinking about you,
I don't care if you exist.
I can't stop thinking about you,
I can't stop wanting you this way.
I can't face living without you,
I can't stop wanting you…
