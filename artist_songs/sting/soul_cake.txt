A soul cake, a soul cake, 
Please, good missus, a soul cake, 
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry, 
Any good thing to make us all merry. 
A soul cake, a soul cake, 
Please, good missus, a soul cake, 
One for Peter, two for Paul, 
And three for Him that made us all. 
God bless the master of this house 
And the mistress also, 
And all the little children 
That round your table grow; 
The cattle in your stable, 
The dogs at your front door, 
And all that dwell within your gates 
We'll wish you ten times more. 
A soul cake, a soul cake: 
Go down into the cellar 
And see what you can fi nd; 
If the barrels are not empty 
We'll hope that you'll be kind; 
We'll hope that you'll be kind 
With your apple and your pear, 
And we'll come no more a-soulin' 
Till Christmas time next year. 
A soul cake, a soul cake: 
The streets are very dirty, 
Me shoes are very thin, 
I have a little pocket 
To put a penny in; 
If you haven't got a penny 
A ha'penny will do; 
If you haven't got a ha'penny 
God bless you. 
A soul cake, a soul cake:
