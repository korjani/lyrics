[VERSE 1:]
This escapee was never gonna stay
On an unfamiliar building on the rooftop where we lay
Where all the constellations shine to pave the way
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go a stray
And I won't delete it
He won't delete it, wha-ha-ho!

[VERSE 2:]
Light bolts hover over you all day
Oh darkness can be difficult like needles in the hay
I need to flick the switch and show you how to hide
And love is not the answer if you're taking me for a
Ri-i-i-i-ide
For a ri-i-i-i-ide

[VERSE 1 REPRISE:]
This escapee was never gonna stay
On an island way too difficult to be stuck in a daze
And all the competition's overcome what may
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go astray
And I won't delete it
He won't delete it, wha-ha-ho!

[OUTRO:]
I'm escaping, you're escaping
I'm escaping, you're taking me for a
Ri-i-i-i-ide
For a ri-i-i-i-ide
I'm escaping, you're escaping
For a ri-i-i-i-ide
I'm escaping, you're escaping
For a ri-i-i-i-ide
I'm escaping, you're escaping
I'm escaping, you're escaping
