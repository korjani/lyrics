Maybe you can owe me? 
Or should we wait and see? 
'Cause I've been saving up for something we need, 
As long as you're open to the possibility, yeah. 

Surely, there's a story in counting all the minutes 'til July the 1st, 
But you counted all the seconds and it made you feel worse, 
I don't wanna be here, 
You just wanna be there, 
But it's awful complicated and you're warning me to beware. 

And honey, there's no hurry, 
I know it's overdue there's a key to the door, 
To the room where I'm staying, 
You can sleep on the floor, 
Half way through the night can we talk and see? 
'Cause there's no way that I'll sleep when you're near me
