Carve your name into my arms, 
'Cause I long to feel your name blood red. 

Leave our love life at the door, 
What's in store? 
We don't know just yet, 
And that is why when we get together, 
There's no need to be clever. 

Lightning struck at eleven same as last night, 
We talk deeper than weather, 
Baseball cap with a feather, 
Fire engine's here to quell the blaze in our life. 

Sidestep neighbours full of lust, 
Good times rust, 
And the runaway's best. 

And when the love detector finds a spark, 
It's before dark when we couldn't care a less, 
And that is why when we get together, 
There's no need to be clever. 

Lightning struck at eleven same as last night, 
We talk deeper than weather, 
Baseball cap with a feather, 
Fire engine's here to quell the blaze in our life
