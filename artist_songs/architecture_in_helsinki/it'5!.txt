Stranger danger, danger stranger
When you gonna follow through?

The mistake you don't make or the rain cloud covers above your house
Steal the feeling and focus on the flames, girl

Have I failed to impress you?
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
But it's 5!
It's 5!

Can I ride with you until the sunset gets all red?
And we'll get chased by the moon

Hope the passion don't fade since you decided he's your spouse
Wheeling, dealing, joking things will change, girl

Have I failed to impress you?
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
But it's 5!
It is 5!
