You don't wanna be
I don't wanna see
Baby get your feet on the floor
Shut the door, count to four
There's ice
(On your shoulders)
I don't wanna fall face down in the flood 
Of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up 
(Don't mess this up)
Let's get older

Remember the foggy window?
Remember lightning and wet clothes?
Remember the house we used to live in:
The cemetery? The cemetery?

There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
And our hearts won't sink cause it's obviously nothing at all
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
The most I have to say isn't really that revealing at all

Everyone you forgot
Everything you could need
Everybody's gonna make it to the cemetery
There's a Fab, there's a Yick
There's a Jenny, there's a Karen
There's a Paul, there's a Jack
There's a Denny

Everyone you forgot
Everything that you need
Everybody gonna make it to the cemetery
There's a Ross, there's a Neil
There's a Lenny, there's an Aaron
There's a Saul, there's a Chip
There's a Benny

Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Do you remember?

Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Oh woah woah woah, way oh, way oh
Do you remember?

Remember the foggy window?
Remember lightning and wet clothes?
Remember the house we used to live in:
The cemetery? The cemetery?

There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
And our hearts won't sink cause it's obviously nothing at all
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
