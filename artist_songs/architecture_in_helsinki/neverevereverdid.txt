Just yesterday, I was walking on the moon with your stalker
And we talked about love and all the battles we'd won
A permanent malaise prevented us from hiding our fortunes
So we left them bare for all the natives to see

One of two things we should have but never did
One of two things we should have but never did

Slender is the finger
Points towards the flaw
Offers you an excuse
To be on all fours

One of two things we should have but never did
One of two things we should have but never did
