Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away (Romantic)

Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?

Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cuz I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)

Tambourine style, walking in a single file
You whisper half thoughts to me

Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?
