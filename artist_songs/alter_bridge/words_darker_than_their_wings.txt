You say you are right
I hope that I’m wrong
I know that you’ve tried
But still it is gone

Just don’t you lose hope
I swear I’d never dream that we’re alone
Now don’t you let go
I swear I still believe though I don’t know

Remember the years
And I still walk tall
I only fear
Now I only crawl

How could I be wrong
I hope there comes a day your fear is gone
How could we be lost
Lost just cease to be not carry on

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Truth alone

You can rise or run

Go never to ask why or to fear again
Go find your peace tonight
Go set out towards the sun
Let the new begin
Go soon your day will come

Your day will come

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Truth alone

Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth alone
