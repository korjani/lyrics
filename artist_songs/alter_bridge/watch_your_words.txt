Watch your words
Or your words might drown you
And cure my wounds
And the light will blind you

To truly see well
You must have faith
Oh the righteous they can't wait
A saving grace
That we all know
Let us pray
Let us hold on

[CHORUS]

I can't breathe
I prefer to find a ceiling
To the hate of mine
I can't win
I can fight no more
I am drowning
And I'm sick inside

Push no more
And the day will find you
Speak no truth
And your ways will end you
It's alright
And you must move on

Though the damage
Has been done
Cherish the life
And the ones you hold
Can you change
Can you go on

[CHORUS]

To truly see well
You must have faith
Oh the righteous they can't wait
A saving grace
That we all know
Let us pray
Let us hold on

[CHORUS]
