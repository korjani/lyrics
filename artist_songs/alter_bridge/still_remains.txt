I cast a line when I saw you were drowning
Still you turn your back on me
Pull you from the fire when you are burning
Still you never could believe

So carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
Oh

Hey [echos]

Save you from your fall when you were slipping
Still you broke from me to run
So how can you justify the life you’re living

You must carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
Oh

You’ll deny it all
You’ll deny me once again
But I’ve seen it all
I know you’ll come to crawl
Back to me before the end.

Carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains

So carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
Still remains
