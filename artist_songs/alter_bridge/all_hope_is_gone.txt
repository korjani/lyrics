A tireless stream of indifference flows
Through veins till the river runs dry.
I no longer care I have all but disposed
Of dreams that I once held inside

Desire is gone after all of these years
The fight has been lost I concede
The apathy born a long time ago
Has grown to what I can't defeat
No

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for
All hope is gone.

The sadness I carry
So deep in my heart for what could have been and might be
It's never forgotten it's never too far
I'm wasted so worn and so weak

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for
All hope is gone

Ahhhh...
All hope is gone.

[Guitar solo]

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for
I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
All hope is gone [x3]
