May this be your victory song
A song for you when I am gone
Reminding you of what you're meant to be
A gift to bring you clarity
To show you that your destiny
Is not defined by what you've failed to see
No

May this lift you up
When you feel you'll fall again
You cannot win, no
Hope these words are enough
For you to be strong, my friend

Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion
Oh, my champion

You've lost so many times it hurts
But failures made are lessons learned
Cause in the end what you are will be much more
Than you were

May this lift you up
When you feel you'll fall again
You cannot win, no
Hope these words are enough
For you to be strong, my friend

Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion

Don't ever run away
For every fear you face
You will survive and be much more
Than you were

Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
The world's gonna try and knock you out
Just pick yourself up when you go down
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion
Oh, my champion
My champion
My champion
