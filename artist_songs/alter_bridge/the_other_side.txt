Just step into the dark, it's waiting
Take your vow, it's time
Time for you to meet your maker
Playing God tonight

You're insane
Have you gone too far?
Who's to blame
For what you are?

If you believe yours is the only way
Then you're the fool who lives to die
Well you deserve the Hell, you're gonna pay
On the other side
Once you reach the other side
Once you reach the other side

The trigger warm, anticipating
The ritual's begun
You think that Heaven's gates are waiting
But only Hell will come

You're insane
Have you gone too far?
Who's to blame
For what you are?

If you believe yours is the only way
Then you're the fool who lives to die
Well you deserve the Hell, you're gonna pay
On the other side
On the other side
Once you reach the other side

Fade to black, you'll see in time
You will only be denied

Fools will only be denied
There will be no paradise
Fools will only be denied
There will be no paradise
Yeah

If you believe yours is the only way
Then you're the fool who lives to die
Well you deserve the Hell, you're gonna pay
On the other side
On the other side
Once you reach the other side
Once you reach the other side
There will be no paradise
Once you reach the other side
There will be no paradise
Yeah
