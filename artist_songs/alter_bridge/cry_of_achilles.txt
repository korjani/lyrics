Crying out
Now you can't escape you are buried in doubt
And it pulls you down
Now you're in too deep
You may never get out
Such an awful fate

Tear it down
It's almost too late is the end coming now
As you scream out loud?
You sever the peace
Till your truth has been found

Is there nothing left to follow?
Is there nothing left to steal?
Crying out for something more than I've been shown
Knowing none of this is real

[Chorus:]
Don't close your eyes
Something beautiful is still alive
Don't close your eyes
Never turn away and let it die

I cannot seem to find the answers
Every truth has slipped away
All that riddles me will never cease to be
Still I search this world in vain

[Chorus]

Cry out to save tomorrow 
It's not too late
Or your heavy heart will follow
You to the grave

This is not the end
This is not the end

[Chorus]

We can't hesitate, hope is not too late
For the time has come, what have we become? 
Nothing left to do but deny the truth
