Against the sky
Streams of light
Call out to me and you

We leave as one
We've just begun
To find the solace we're due
This is the life we must choose

[Chorus:]
We will make a brand new start
From the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us

Cast your sorrows to the wind
Let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

This desert road
That we call home
This is our destiny
We'll chase the setting sun
As we outrun
A life of agony
God how we ache to be free

[Chorus 2x]

We'll make our way
We'll make our way
We'll make our way
We'll make our way
