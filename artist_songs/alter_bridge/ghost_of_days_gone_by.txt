The misery I know
Like a friend that won't let go
Is creeping up on me now once again

So I sing this song tonight
To the ghost that will not die
And somehow seems to haunt me till the end

Do you feel the same
For what once remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry for the Ghost of Days Gone By

I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars

It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

Do you feel the same
For what once remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry for the Ghost of Days Gone By

And I know it's drawing closer
With each day I fear the end
And I... don't wanna die
Don't wanna die, don't wanna die

I don't wanna die

Do you feel the same
For what once remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry for the days gone by
Do they haunt you like a ghost until the end
Haunt you till the end, until the end
Until the end, until the end
