I am not alone
I live with the memories, regret is my home
This is my true freedom
Express all the feelings of what I've become
I watch the rising sun

[Chorus:]
I hope I find some peace today
It seems I've gone away
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've really lost my way
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've
Shed my skin

Are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Are you ready for me?
A bitter sinking feeling

Awake to the fact there's no going back
To this world in which I was living
I'm searching for something but found less than nothing
I watch the rising sun

[Chorus]

Are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Are you ready for me
Oh 'cause I'm dying to feel
What I have lost

Oh and what I was
All my life I've waited
Endless days have taken
Taken what made me free
Years have gone
I'm broken

Left the past unspoken
Those years
Oh they haunt me still
Shed my skin
Are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Are you ready for me
And shed my skin
All my love I'm waited
Endless days have taken
What made me free

Years have gone. I'm broken
Left the past unspoken
Those years, they haunt me still
