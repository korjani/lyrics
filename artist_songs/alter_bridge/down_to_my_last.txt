And to the ones in which we sing,
We are honored you let us in
I remember the thoughts of many things,
Of the glory that you bring

I was never the right one to dare to dream,
It's funny what this life has done to me now
You were always the only,
To help me see there was a road I must find,
A road that was mine

But I'm down to my last,
I'm standing here alone
Looking back, on it all
But I'm down to my last,
I'm ready but I'm wrong,
And I'm blind to it all

And to the world to which we sing,
Want to try to do us in
I remember your name and I know your face
Can't forgive and can't erase

I was never the right one
To bear the weight of something fueled by words
I'd learn to hate 
You were always the only
To help me see that to love is to shine
In your world, blind

But I'm down to my last
I'm standing here alone
Looking back on it all
But I'm down to my last
I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm right to it all

[solo]

But I'm down to my last
Well I'm ready but I'm wrong,
And I'm scared of it all

But I'm down to my last
I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all
But I'm down to my last
And I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all
