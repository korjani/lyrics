Tell me how it feels to live a lie
Tell me do you know that it won't ever be the same
You can't deny, the house of cards just hit the floor
Don't tell me you can save it in the end
There's nothing you can do
'cause when it's gone, you know it won't come back again
But you don't listen anymore

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
Too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

If only I had said this long ago
If only I had found a way to tell you all the things you should've known
But you were lost right from the start
How the hell are you the one to blame
You've done no wrong, you gave it all
So why the hell do you have to change
You broke your back, she broke your heart

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
So addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

Cry out!
You know it now!
She sold you out!
You're gonna lose it all!

Cry out!
You know it now!
Just tear it down!
You're gonna lose it all!

[Guitar Solo]

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
Too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

You're addicted to pain
Sometimes it seems like nothing else matters
You're too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

Cry out!
You know it now!
In time you're gonna lose it all!

Cry out!
You know it now!
You don't listen anymore

Cry out!
You know it now!
In time you're gonna lose it all!

Cry out!
You know it now!
You don't listen anymore
