Oooooo.
Another rebel runs against the grain
A loner is born
He's filled with anguish
Deep within he's dying everyday
To find his way
He is lost
So consumed

Can you feel him?
Somewhere in the fallout
He is someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him?
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk the fallout on his own

So frustrated
He walks the line alone
Courage sets him apart
He is so faithless
All he once embraced he now disowns
He let it go
All the while
He still waits

Can you feel him?
Somewhere in the fallout
He is someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him?
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk the fallout on his own

Left behind he's walking burning still he tries
To unearth the meaning to this life
Cast aside he's weary bleeding to behold
Disconnected still he fights for truth alone

Can you feel him?
Somewhere in the fallout
He is someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him?
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk the fallout on his own
