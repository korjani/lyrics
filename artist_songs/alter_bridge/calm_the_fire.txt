Calm the fire do not fight anymore
They don't know what they're saying they don't know anything at all
For all that matters is you know that this is not their fault
There are places we should never go
Lost between the cracks something wicked waits below
And all I'm saying there are some things better left unseen at all

It's been so long it's tearing me apart
I cannot understand or comprehend
Where we went wrong. Now we've come so far
The madness in our hearts will never end

Cause I've seen it all
I can't fight it anymore
If fire burns forevermore
Is there nothing left to save?

[Chorus:]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

Is there no more have we gone too far?
There's nothing I can do to make you sway
To see the blood running through our hearts
No different from the blood we've come to hate

When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can't deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]

Now let it calm the fire that burns within your heart tonight
For some are too blind to see the world as it's meant to be

When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can't deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]
