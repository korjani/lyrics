When all is lost to you inside
When all the darkness takes the light
The ritual it has begun
And now you tear away from everyone
Disconnected so alone yeah
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation If you could only see
What will come to be
Yeah!

Justify you waste away
You dare to dream but still you're too afraid
And now you're broken and deceived
Lost to live this cruel reality
You're disconnected so alone
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation If you could only see
What will come to be 
Yeah!

Maybe you'll stand
Maybe you'll give and break to find another way
And make things better
Maybe you'll find
A life you can live and learn to love along the way
And make things better
And make things better

Isolation Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation If you could only see
What will come to be
Yeah!

Isolation Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation If you could only see
What will come to be

You're disconnected so alone
What will come to be?
You're disconnected so alone
