Drank so much last night
I think that I drowned 
But now my cup is empty 
No one has seen my will around
Now my heart is aching 
Sometimes I fall asleep for days 
But my bed is empty 
I know I am too set in my ways
Tell all I am ok

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on

Flew so high last night
I think that I fell to the ground so heavy 
Woke up to find this living hell
It used to be so easy 
Hard to tell my nights now from my days
The curtains hide my feelings 
Don't feel I have any right to pray
And they will find me someday, Someday 

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on

And whatever takes us anyway
Will be the same to drive us on
Remember to find a new day

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on
