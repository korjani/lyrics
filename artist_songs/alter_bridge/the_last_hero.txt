Can you hear the marching, beating of the drums?
Once again the dogs are out for blood
Words and accusations, history revised
But time is gonna tell that you were right

Oh how you tried
I know that you tried
To save us

Save us

I remember dreaming not so long ago
The change was gonna come, I still had hope
How long must I keep waiting, feeling so ignored
Is anything worth saving anymore?

I just don't know
But need you so

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero?

Tyrants overtaking intoxicate with lies
There is no escaping, not this time
The simple man receiving, defending every crime
Somehow still believing they're alright

So hypnotized

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero?

Tell me where are the heroes?
No
Tell me where are the heroes?
No, no
Have we lost all the heroes?
No

How could it be, we couldn't see
Now we are left here to fight this on our own

Build them up to tear them down
What we've done I'm far from proud
Chew 'em up
Spit 'em out
In the end
Who'll save us now?

Can you hear the marching, beating of the drums
Once again the dogs are out for blood
Words and accusations, history revised
But time is gonna tell that you were right

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero?

Have we reached the end?
Are we lost to know?
Have we sealed our fate?
Nowhere left to go
Though it's much too late
This I hope to see
There is still a chance left
For you and me
