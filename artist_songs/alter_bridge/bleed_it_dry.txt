Oceans rise, summits fall
Fading fast it won’t be long
Everything will be consumed, rendered lost
At the hands of fools tomorrow’s gone
So say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Bleed it dry, leave us here with nothing
Justify all that you consume 
Bleed it dry, what is this becoming?
All your lies serve no one but you

Blood machines burn the skies
Turning day into night
Everything will fade to dust again, weak or strong
So don’t pretend you’ve done no wrong
Cause you know that I’m right

[Chorus]

One day you will see what you’ve done
The world you chose to bleed will be dead and gone

[Chorus x2]
