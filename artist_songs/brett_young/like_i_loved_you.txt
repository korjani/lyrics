Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are

Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say

We can still be friends
No I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
