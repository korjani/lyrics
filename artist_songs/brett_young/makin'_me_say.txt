Mmmh
Baby when you pull your hair back
Cadillac red lipstick slow rollin on your lips
The mirror on a Saturday night
Oh you got that look in your eye
I see you slippin' on your high heels
Worn out of town, edge of the bed, showin' some leg
When you doin that hallway walk
Oh baby I can barely talk

You're makin' me say mmmmh
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmmh ooooh
I like it when you make me say mmh

When you get a little ticked off
And a four letter word slips out of your mouth
I can't help but laugh
You're so sexy when you're mad
The way that you can get your buzz on one or two drinks
Cute little dimple on your cheeks
Start throwing flirty lines at me
Saying baby come and dance with me
Dance with me

You're makin' me say mmmmh
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmmh ooooh
I like it when you make me say
Mmmh
I like it when you make me say

Girl you got me sayin good lord, God bless, amen
Again and again
Sayin good lord, God bless, amen

You're makin' me say mmmmh
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmmh ooooh
I like it when you make me say mmh
I like it when you make me say mmh
I like it when you make me say
Oooh
I like it when you make me say mmmh
