All my friends say that they're happy that I'm moving on
First time that they've seen me smile since you up and gone
But your memory won't let me go
Pretty as a picture that you'd hang up on a wall
But she just can't compare to you and it really ain't her fault
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me girl I've tried
But your memory won't let me

She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
No your memory won't let me

Sometimes when she's close to me I still smell your perfume
And everytime I'm holding her, I'm really holding you
And any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
But your memory won't let me

She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
Oh your memory won't let me

I know that I should fall for her
Believe me girl I've tried
But your memory won't let me

She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
Oh your memory won't let me go
No your memory won't let me go
Won't let me
Oh your memory won't let me go
