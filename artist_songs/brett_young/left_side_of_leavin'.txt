The thing about a break up
Sometimes you just gotta break down
Coming off a great love
There's plenty of pain to pass around
Like a tip jar in a dive bar
Full of broken hearts
It's a lonely crowd
The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down

When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'

The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last

When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side

You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping, woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking, woah

When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
