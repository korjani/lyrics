Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin so good just to hurt me
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning
Cause it's still burning

So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me
No

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

Woah
Oh have mercy

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy
