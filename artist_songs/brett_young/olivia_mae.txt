Olivia may I get to know ya?
Buy you a coffee or a drink sometime next week
Olivia maybe I could call you
Olivia what do ya think?
Yeah, what do ya think?

Cause Olivia Mae I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia may I?
Olivia may I?

Olivia may I've fallen for you
The past year with you has been the best year of my life
And Olivia Mae I think I love you
And I hope that that's alright
Tell me that's alright

Cause Olivia Mae I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia may I?
Oh may I?

Olivia may I ask you a question?
What are you doing for the rest of your life?

Cause Olivia Mae I see you standing there
The sunlight shining through your hair
No one ever looked so good in white
Olivia Mae I'm glad it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
The girl I'm meant to love for my whole life
And I know that I won't always get it right
But I promise I'll try
I promise I'll try
Olivia may I?
Olivia may I?
Olivia may I?
