Lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
Your goodbyes are never on time
The blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
Don't you think I feel it, too?

A slow train, a cold rain, I'm all inside out
The lights just aren't shining on me
To live it again, I'd believe in a lie
Don't you think I feel it, too?

In a world of my own, where the ground is my home
And the lights, they shine only from the sky
Like you, like a fool, I'm lost in the blues
And don't you think I feel it, too?

In a world of my own, where the ground is my home
And the lights, they shine only from the sky
Like you, like a fool, I'm lost in the blues
And don't you think I feel it, too?

Lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
Your goodbyes are never on time
The blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
And don't you think I feel it, too?
And don't you think I feel it, too?
