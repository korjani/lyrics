Oh arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free
That brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She'd been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
In fact ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears
Over a brown eyed handsome man
A lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man

Well a beautiful a daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her, "Darlin' go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man"

Well the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Well-a two, three the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
A-rounding third he was a-heading for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game it was a brown eyed handsome man
