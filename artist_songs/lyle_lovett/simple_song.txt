It's a simple song for simple feeling
You see the moon and watch it rise
Across the continent the night bird sings
And somewhere someone hears its cry

So disillusioned
Keep your head down
If you do they'll never know
You'll have no answers to their questions
And they will have to let you go

And disenfranchised
Revolution
They'll take away by right what's yours
And make you martyrs of your own cause
When they don't know what cause it's for

And all deserted
Stand alerted
They'll love you when you're all alone
But you find a red rose in the morning light
You wait the night and find it gone

So hear my words with faith and passion
For what I say to you is true
And when you find the one you might become
Remember part of me is you
