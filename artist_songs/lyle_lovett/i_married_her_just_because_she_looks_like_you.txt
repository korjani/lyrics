Its not the words
You know I'll always love you
It's not the words
I wish that I could stay
It's more the way your lips looked
As you spoke them
And how the moonlight fell upon your face
I married her just because she looks like you

And for every time you said no
She says honey I'll be glad to
And for every time you left me
She says darling I'll be there
It's not the words
You'll get over me
That made my dreams come true
I married her just because she looks like you

And if I had not searched for you
I never would have found her
And if I had not loved you
I would never have known love
It's not the words
Please try to forget me
That made my dreams come true
I married her just because she looks like you

And for every time you knocked me down
She reaches out to help me
And for every time you cursed me
She says darling I love you
It's not the words
Time heals everything
That made my dreams come true
I married her just because she looks like you
