I'm a traveling man don't tie me down
There's just too much living going all around
A man he's got to see what he can see
I love the road and I love the air
And I don't worry hell I never care
I love my women sometimes they love me

But I was got one day I still don't know how
I didn't even like that town
This fellow said stranger why don't you just go on home
And I said man that's where I'm headed to
And you couldn't stop me if you knew what to do
And I left and I planned to go alone

But the road was long and home was far
So I stopped off at this little cowboy-looking bar
I walked on through the door and she just smiled
In a long pony tail and a pretty white dress
She said hi bull riders do it best
I said oh my God what's your name
My name's Lyle

And I said ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
Take your boots and walk out of my life
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
I can't be no cowgirl paradise

I looked at her and she looked at me
And I looked back and she looked back
And we went out together for a walk
Her eyes were bright just like the stars
But she drove a pickup said she hated cars
But loved to ride around out after dark

And I said ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
Take your boots and walk out of my life
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
I can't be no cowgirl paradise

I told her redneckness has got to be a disease
You catch it on your fingers and it just crawls right up your sleeves
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
I can't be no cowgirl paradise

Well how she did it I'll never know
But it's been maybe 20 years or so
And she cooks the supper and I try to pay the rent
But I'm a traveling man don't tie me down
There's just too much living go all around
But I can't figure out quite where it went

Then I think ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
Take your boots and walk out of my life
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
I can't be no cowgirl paradise
