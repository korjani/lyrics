If you want that girl
Listen son
Don't you sit around and cry
Because love
In this world
Ain't nothing you can't buy

She's got
Ruby lips
And emerald eyes
She's got diamonds on her mind
If you want that girl
What you need is
M-o-n-e-y

That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y
That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y

I was out last night
With my girlfriend
Things were going
Very fine
And I asked her
Would you like a kiss
She said thank you no but I'll have some
M-o-n-e-y

That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y
That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y

No finance
No romance
Was how she told me goodbye
First she took my love
And then she took all my
M-o-n-e-y

That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y
That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y

'Cause she's got
Ruby lips
And emerald eyes
She's got diamonds on her mind
And if you want that girl
What you need is
M-o-n-e-y
And that's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y
That's m-o-n-e-y baby
M-o-n-e-y
