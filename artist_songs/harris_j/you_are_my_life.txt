O Allah!
You're the light that shines above
You're the reason I never give up
You're The One I try for, live my life for
Give up all I have
You're the melody, You're the key
All the inspiration I need
And when times get tough
I know You'll stand by me

You are the love I need
The One who is guiding me
And You know my destiny
For You are The Light

And You are my life
Oh oh oh

O Allah!
Your words light up my heart
This connection I've felt from the start
I’ll never lose sight of my dreams
Without You where would I be?
And although I feel like I'm 
A million miles away from home
I can lose all that I have and when I feel the pain
I know that I can count on You 

You are the love I need
The One who is guiding me
And You know my destiny
For You are The Light

And You are my life
Oh oh oh
And You are my life
Oh oh oh
And You are my life

When I reach the final chapter
I know it’s only You that matters, oh
So I give it my all 
‘Cause I’ll stand alone that day

You are the love I need
The One who is guiding me
And You know my destiny
For You are The Light

And You are my life
Oh oh oh
And You are my life
Oh oh oh
And You are my life
Oh oh oh
And You are my life
Oh oh oh

And You are my life
And You are my life
