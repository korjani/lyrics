These friends of mine will come and go
I’m the first to leave and last to know
I’ll be swimming in a face of flames
For these friends of mine I’ve overpaid
And I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down 
All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down

Veins are glistening
So thanks a lot for listening
I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down
All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down

Well I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

Yeah! Yeah! Ooh someone left the lights on
Yeah! Yeah! Ooh someone left the lights on
Yeah! Yeah! Ooh someone left the lights on
Yeah! Yeah! Ooh someone left the lights on 

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down
All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down

Well I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know
