There's a mad man looking at you
and he wants to take your soul. 
There's a mad man with a mad plan
and he's dancing at your door. Oh
What to do, oooh
what to do
when the walls are built to crumble. 
There's a mad man with a mad plan
and he waits for us to stumble. 

Oooh, but our eyes are open
yeah, they're really open
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I say we rob from the rich
and blow down the door.
On to the next 
to dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders. 
You can jump on my shoulders.
We rob from the rich
and blow down the door.
On to the next 
to dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders. 
You can jump on my shoulders. 

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Everybody it's ok if 
you're mad at what I'm saying. 
Make peace, baby shake my hand cuz
I'm pretty sure I'm staying. Oh
what to do, ooooh
look at you, when the walls begin 
to crumble.
It's a mad man with a mad plan
and he waits for us to stumble.  

Oooh, but our eyes are open
yeah, they're really open
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I say we rob from the rich
and blow down the door.
On to the next 
to dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders. 
You can jump on my shoulders.
We rob from the rich

Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
Stay in the water
I'm scared of the city
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city. 

I'm scared of the city
live in the water
I'm scared of the city
I'll pray for you

I say we rob from the rich
and blow down the door.
On to the next 
to dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
