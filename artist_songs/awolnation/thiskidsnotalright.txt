(I still don't know what I'm doing)
Fuck

Troubles coming for the free, man
We shake from shaking with the free hand
So stand tall, shout out with me

Do your dirty work without me
Say you're best when no one can see
Stand up, catch fire with me

(This kid, this kid, this kid, this kid, this kid)

This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
But this kid's not alright

I've been sleeping with these
I've been sleeping with these thoughts, man
I've been contemplating singing them
So stand up, catch fire with me

(This kid, this kid, this kid, this kid, this kid)

You can follow them to hell

This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
But this kid's not alright

I'm scared, I may be right

You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell

This kid's not alright
You can follow them to hell
This kid's not alright
You can follow them to hell
This kid's not alright
You can follow them to hell
But this kid's not alright
