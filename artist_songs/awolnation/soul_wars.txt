Yeah!
1, 2, 3
Do you love me?
Watch me scream
Burning on the trees
In amazement
'Cause I'm on fire
You know?

4, 5, 6
Show ya all my tricks
Fee Fii Fo
A giant's at the door
In amazement
'Cause I'm on fire

Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh (Ooh)
'Cause I'm on fire

Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it

Taste the smoke

Taste the smoke

Taste the smoke
This is no joke
Fifteen years
Blood, sweat, and tears
And amazement
'Cause I'm on fire

It's a cruel, cruel world
For good boys and girls
A hot day in heaven,
5, 6, and 7
And amazement
'Cause I'm on fire

With no hope from the devil

Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it

It'll be OK, baby

Oo, Ha
Oo, Ha
Oo, Ha
Oo, Ha

We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run

Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it

We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run

Ah ahhhhahha
Ah ahhhhahha
Ah ahhhhahha
Ah ahhhhahha
