Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

Wake up
Well it's nice to meet you
Do you have a name?
'Cause I would like to teach you, baby
Alright
If it's unfamiliar
When the sharks are swimming
We will watch them kill ya, baby
Yeah, you
I'm a little shocked
'Cause I can see the future
Lookin' through your eyes
Tonight
Don't you fall asleep
Don't you fall
It's only gonna take a little time

Before we start to lose our minds
We're leavin' all the haters behind
Before the sun decides to hide
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
I'm scared to love what we love most
It's only gonna take a little time
Before we start to lose our minds
Wake
Up

Wake up
Well it's nice to know ya
Have you learned to fly?
'Cause I would like to show ya, baby
Alright
If it's unfamiliar
When I taste your face
Then I can break the mirror, baby
Yeah, you
I'm afraid to hide
'Cause I can live today
Before I say goodbye
Tonight
Don't you fall asleep
Don't you fall
It's only gonna take a little time

Before we start to lose our minds
We're leavin' all the haters behind
Before the sun decides to hide
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
I'm scared to love what we love most
It's only gonna take a little time
Before we start to lose our minds
Wake
Up

Take some time to breathe
Let's take some time to breathe
From the desert to the sea
It's the same for you and me
When you say you'd rather bleed
Is it really what you're thinking
Let's take some time to breathe
Out, yeah
It's only gonna take a little time

Before we start to lose our minds
We're leavin' all the haters behind
Before the sun decides to hide
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
I'm scared to love what we love most
It's only gonna take a little time
Before we start to lose our minds
Wake
Up
It's only gonna take a little time
Before we start to lose our minds
We're leavin' all the haters behind
Before the sun decides to hide
(You got to know, you got to know)
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
I'm scared to love what we love most
It's only gonna take a little time
(Wake)
(Up)
Before we start to lose our minds
Wake
Up
