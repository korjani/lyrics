I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell
[x2]

She's blackening my name
My army never came
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control

She's blackening my name
I know you feel the same
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

Stop squeezing on my neck
Your unemployment check
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control

Waiting on a blood line
You can find some free time
Look at who you're hating
Now your celebrating

Waiting on a blood line
You can find some free time

Waiting on a blood line [x3]

She's blackening my name
Be careful who you tell

Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control
