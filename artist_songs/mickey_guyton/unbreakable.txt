Too big, too small, too in between, I've heard it all
You'll never stand out in a crowd
Too different, too plain, no one gonna know your name
You'll never make nobody proud

But when the going gets tough, the tough start swinging
The storm picks up, the strong just lean in
The road gets rough, we say bring it on

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

They laugh at your tears, pour their poison in your ears
They say you never have, you never will

But when the going gets tough, the tough start swinging
The storm picks up, the strong just lean in
The road gets rough, we say bring it on

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

Let it all crash in, let it all come down

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

Oh, oh, unbreakable
Yeah, unbreakable
We're unbreakable
