So he broke your heart in a jagged line
And he brought the rain and he stole your shine
And now you're crying on the bedroom floor
And you're feeling like the storm ain't ever gonna let up
They say everything happens for a reason
But right now you don't wanna believe it
You wanna ride around all over time
Letting all the sad songs break you down
Every mile, but just give it a while

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
Somebody else will

I know it's cliche but you know it's true
There's a million more fishes in the deep blue
No he ain't the only one
Pretty soon your sinking sun is gonna be rising up
So whatever good ain't good enough

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
So much better, so don't settle
'Til you feel the way that it's s'posed to feel
Yeah if he don't love you like he ought to
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
I'm telling you, girl, somebody else will

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
So much better, so don't settle
'Til you feel the way that it's s'posed to feel
Yeah if he don't love you like he ought to
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
I'm telling you, girl, somebody else will
