[Hook - Bladee:]
Nice, no distance, nights, night vision
Life, existence, nice, existence

Night vision in my armor, yeah, I took it over
Watching Space Jam, Lean's never sober
Stunting with my team, is your baby's mama dream
I'm so icy, I'm so clean, Sad Boys, and Yung Lean
Drive a body down in my Range Rover
Trying to calm it down like I'm Oprah
Police knocking on my window
But it's like I told ya, soon as they approach us
Squash 'em like cock roaches

[Hook]

Sad Boys season, I'm in space for a reason
Coke on my clothes, counting stacks up in Sweden
My trees spent, let me, let me get me some
Three headed dolphin, it's the threesome
Lean, lean and Hennessy and sprite
With the cheese and the Mac to your back
Make you believe in religion
Found upon gods in the season, Sad Boys season
Digimon, plane crashes, smoke hash til the ashes
Vietnam flashes
Ecstasy in the glass
Iced out patches on my scars, but it's rashes
Digimon plane crashes, smoke hash til the ashes
Vietnam flashes

[Hook]

Arizona, Arizona, Arizona, Arizona, Iced Out Boys
Emotional Boys, taking over the noise
Night vision, camera flashes
Smoke hash til the ashes, Sad Boys
Night vision, nice existence
Shout outs to Gud on the beat
Shout outs to Mr. PP under the streets
