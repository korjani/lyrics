[Hook:]
Empire of emotions
Pokemon lotion
6 hunna emails I ain't even open
Bitch you must be joking
Neon Green plants Gucci on my pants coke on my teeth so I'm hard to understand
Posted in space I'll barely ever land
I'm a Sadboy with my Sadboys
We got Sadgirls we got marble pearls

[Hook 2:]
Pearl necklace, floating mansion, designer drugs I'm flexin [x2]
I'm flexin

Lean steady depressed bruh emotionalboys in the VIP section
1 million plants in my room my walls are melting
Reach out a hand with no gravity cause nobody is helping
I'm trynna be down to Earth but the floor is really melting
Green on my head, call me yung caeser
Cheese in my bed in Tokyo for Easter,
I'm steezin, I'm a reacher, I'm reaching out but I can't reach her
You need me well I guess I dont need her

Empire of emotions
My Pokemon lotion
6 hunna emails I ain't even open
Bitch you must be joking
Floating ruin, floating ruin, floating ruin

[Hook 2]

I'm steezin, I'm a reacher, I'm reaching out but I can't reach her
You need me well I guess I don't need her
