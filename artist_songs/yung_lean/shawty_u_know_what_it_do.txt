[Hook:]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrist links when I come through
I finna take 'em to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, paint it true
Shawty, you know what it do

Smokin' double, give me two
Shawty, you know what it do
I don't give no fucks 'bout you
I take it all, can never lose
Only myself for my trues
Lovin' this shit since I was two
Got helicopters on my roof
I'm hiding far away from you
Sad Mob, we don't fuck wit fools
I’m in the snow sipping Grey Goose
Double Gs on my shoe
Gs on my shoes

[Hook:]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrist links when I come through
I finna take 'em to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, paint it true
Shawty, you know what it do
