It's ain't even my fault though?
Fire
F-f-f-f-fire
Fire
F-f-f-f-fire

Flames, fire and a buyer
Cause you know I got that fire, yung leandoer can't expire
We walked in this, they sound like a choir
Bitch I'm smokin' spirit flowers
Cause you know it takes me higher
My money speedin' no flat tire
Over on this side it is drier
Louis Vuitton sheets with flowers
Helicopters round the windows
Now I'm sippin' everything slow
You would think i said that in the intro
I'm ridin' past you in that limo
Sadboy gang we some heroes
Money bitches like flamingos
Riding past you in that limo
Xans on me, oh lord
I stick my head out the window

Fuck school, it made me sick
All of my haters, they make me rich
They warned me about this shit
I'mma do this till I go extinct
Bitches, just know that its yung leandoer
Straight from the sewer posted with Bladee Krueger
Hit him and get him, I stack 'em, I rip 'em
Just like my stacks, I got cash in my denim
Salvation, bitch I need my medication (meds)
Sadboy gang, bitch we one nation (GBE)
Posted up celebrating, takin' flights like vacation
Paper chasin', I keep 'em waitin'
Bitch, you know that I keep 'em waitin'

Fire, I'mma still live in the fire
Yung leandoer can't expire
We walked in this, they sound like a choir
Cause you know I got that fire
