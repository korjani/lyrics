Smoking on some sour
In Bahamas
Wearing Green Polo Pajamas
Made of marijuana
Fuck an ugly ho
Like Johnny Drama
Licking off dripping champagne from my fingernail
Tripping off ginger-ale
This tune ain't got no hook
Like a hunky tail
Me and pedram on this bitch, we're in aventail
On the beach, with the pink polo, the color of rose
Dirty stinking feet
Started drinking whiskey neat
Already drinken' three
Yung Lean is that curly-haired freak
Take a seat
Got a new passport eating lobster in court
Teleport to a new time zone with an escort
Got a fort, filled with hoes who just want to snort
Take a boat to my resort, in Hawaii
Where I got a tennis court
I forgot to mention that I still get child support

Drinking forties out in Honolulu
With my shawty and she's siftin' on chicken pu-pu
I'm in doo-doo, hoes sucking nuts but this ain't no chippendales
Drifting fails off a drifting tale
Made of minimum wage
Starring in shit movies like Nicolas Cage
I'm drinking a pina colada in the plage
Inhale exhale fuck a female, throw stones on madlib backstage
