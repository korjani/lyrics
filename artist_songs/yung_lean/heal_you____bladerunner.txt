Profound sadness!

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

She's my tangerine shadow, you know I got the fame
Shorty I'm made by bape, blazing up in the day
White powder on my chinese plates
Sipping gatorade somewhere up in space
Posted up with Bladee, pills after pills
Hide it in my motherfucking

Hi-top nikes, bitch I'm running with blades
So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days
I can heal you shorty in a million ways
I can heal you shorty in a million ways

[Bladee:]
Cut you like mango
My iPod is nano
Lasers are my ammo
I'm shooting at your camo
Nike on my sandals
My blunts are like candles
Got her in darkness
We start lighting candles
GTB and Sadboys
It's real tears I'm sad boy
I think I can heal you
Just call me on my Android

Hi-top nikes, bitch I'm running with blades
So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days
I can heal you shorty in a million ways
I can heal you shorty in a million ways
