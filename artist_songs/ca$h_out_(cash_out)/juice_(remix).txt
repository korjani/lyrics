[Hook x2:]
Got choppers on choppers
Got bitches on bitches
My ho do the dishes
We play in them kitchens
My whip is on sixes
Got pounds of the chickens
Rolex's on wrists

[Verse 1 - Cash Out:]
We in the trap house
We selling that loud
We cooking up oz
Come shop at my store
You liking my glow
I'm liking your ho
She put on a show
Do it on the low
A stack on her shoes
50 racks on my jewels
They say I'm so cool
I'm breaking the news

They try to keep up
I keep switching up
I keep geeking up

Yeah baby mama the squeezes
The all on their knees-es
They thinking I'm Yeezus
My piece yeah it's Jesus
My money got creases
My cars got no leases
My house got no leases

Got green in the tacos

I'm all in Belize
I'm rocking the seas
My diamonds is water
I paid off my lawyer

Kill you for an offer

Can't smell like a fish
I cook in the dish
I out with your bitch
