[Hook:]
Starting tonight
You bout to have the time of your life

And we gon party till the sun goes down
Starting tonight

Time of your life

[Verse 1:]
Hold up, let me put my suit on
Get my GQ on
I don't what you on
But I'm in that Maybach
And I got a lot of racks
Your girl is on my dick
Tell me what you know bout that
She ain't never seen a party like this
And we drinking ace girl, we ain't popping no Cris
And I ain't ever seen a body like this
But I swear, but I swear that girl, yes she pop it like Chris Brown
Said, I swear I'm going down, head
I swear you going down, head
And after this party, you know we hit the bed

[Verse 2:]
Flashing lights, champagne
You can tell I do the damn thing
No president, but girl check out my campaign
And all this money in this room will drive you insane
Everybody in my circle, yeah we wealthy
And the money keep coming like I'm making it, I can't help it
And your girl keep running to me, man I can't help it
And I keep on making these hits, man I can't help it
Yeah, she twerking her body, she working her body
And she independent, she deserve to be in a Bugatti
Ha, but you only get to have one night
So baby let's have the time of your life
