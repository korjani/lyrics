[Intro: Lil Durk with Tion Phipps]
Rich town made this beat
Who made this beat?
At the fuckin sun up
At the autopilot poppin
I said all the jury shoppin
[?] All I need [?] All I need
Preach

[Hook: Ca$h Out with Tion Phipps]
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is some loyalty
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is some loyalty
I'm a hold it down (down)
Things go down (things go down)
No turn around
All I need is some loyalty (some loyalty)
I talked to God to see if he can make it better
And I kept saying seven letters
Loyalty

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
Sound like the talk that I had with my nigga yesterday (watcha talkin' bout?)
Waiting on the pills sitting down for pistol play
I tell em yal need to keep ya head up
And when pressure gets tight niggas don't let up
But niggas gotta get wet up
For thinking this is a set up
Sounds like shit I feel man
If I was in your shoes I'd kill a nigga
I see you nigga (that real shit)
Green dot, green dot, ass little foe (ass little foe)
She got a little flag she like leave her alone
Who can I trust family members
Ooh this shit is stressful (this shit is stressful)
Had to read up and got a good heart and left niggas extra
Ride with my two (with my two), no extras (if only)
Askin myself this question
I'm feeling lonely
Preach

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Loyalty over Royalty
She got a bag so she spoiled to me
Long days she be holding me
In her room and she starts calling me
[?]
Said she cheating and they don't even know it
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is to lean on her shoulder
Real niggas cry too
Real niggas die too
But who is you to lie to?
I won't lie, keep my L's high
And I love who I lie too
Free lie, free beef, free lawsuit
And keep your mouth closed
Don't you talk to thot hoes
Every getting money nigga got those
I'm a ride with my nigga (yea)
I'm a die with my nigga (yea)
Magazine with a magazine I'm bout one nigga (bluh)
And my arms stay high (arms stay high)
But she awfully damn good
Freedom is a lie
Bitch freedom is [?]

[Hook]
