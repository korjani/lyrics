Meet me tonight in dreamland
Meet me tonight in dreamland
Where the things I want will come true
For in dreamland they always do
So meet me tonight in dreamland
Meet me on the path of green
Where nightmares disappear in dreams
Sleeping as one
Flowered river carries us down
To dreamland

In dreams
Kisses are pure as the sky is blue
In dreams
As it carries the thoughts I have of you
In dreams
Kisses are pure as the sky is blue
Dreamland, dreamland!

The wind is a perfume of blossoms that hide
From the people who'd trample a dream such as ours
Blossoms that fall from trees so tall
That falling is floating in heaven for hours
Trees that are towers that rise above
The bower of dreams where I lie with my love
Dreams that fly from our hearts to each other
Shared thoughts of our love under the covers

In dreams
Kisses are pure as the sky is blue
In dreams
As it carries the thoughts I have of you
In dreams
Kisses are pure as the sky is blue
Dreamland, dreamland!

With kisses we are entwined
With the lillies and the vines
All on the path
1st night I dreamed I had burning hands
Reaching for beautiful visions
And everything was shimmering

The friends that have walked on before us
Are waiting to take us to laughter and dancing
The friends that have walked on before us
Are waiting to take us to the sky

I dreamed I was in a boat floating on air
And everything was there
And everything was shimmering
