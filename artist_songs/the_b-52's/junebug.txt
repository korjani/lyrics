She's the wildest hon in the wild kingdom
She's the wildest thang to float down
Well there's alligators and razorbacks,
But I don't care, I like to go down tubin' with you, Junebug
When Junebug floats down and yells "Hey!"
Even the razorbacks get outta her way
Ya know what I mean?
The mouth of the river is laughing at us, Junebug,
You know what I'm talking about
Junebug, Junebug, Junebug, Junebug

On the wildest run in the wild kingdom,
She's the wildest thang to float down!
Well there's snakes and snappers on cypress knees,
So come on down, I like to play in the water with you, Junebug
Well don't you listen to what they say,
'Cause we're a little different anyway.
Ain't it the truth!

Let's glide behind a wall of vegetation; no prying eyes on
A love celebration!
Let's glide behind that wall of vegetation,
I don't want no prying eyes when I give you a love sensation!
The mouth of the river is laughing at us, Junebug, Junebug.

Hey there Junebug, you sure look good dancing in the mud...
In the red mud!
Mosquitoes and water moccasins, 'gators and crocodiles
June's imagination really drives me wild!

GO Girl GO Girl GO Girl GO!
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!
Let's get in the mud, I think I'm in love!
Junebug! GO GO GO Junebug GO GO GO Junebug!
