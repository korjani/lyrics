There's a moon in the sky
It's called the moon
And everybody is there, including,
Saturn, Mercury
Saturn, Venus
Saturn, Mars
Saturn, Jupiter
The Van Allen Belt

Roll-roll-roll-roll-rollin' in Andromeda
Won-ton-ton-ton rama-in-Andromeda

There's too many rings---This is the Space Age
There's too many things---This is the Space Age
Just ain't no atmosphere tonight

If you're lucky you get to ride in a gold meteorite
If you're not, you get a mouth, a mouthful of red Kryptonite
You better move over
Here comes a Super-nova
Kryptonite- - -
Destination moon

If you're in outer space
Don't feel out of place
'cause there are thousands of others like you
Others like you
Others like you

Well there's a moon, it's in the sky
It's called the moon
And everybody is there 'cluding
'ranus
Neptune
'ranus
Pluto
Destination moon

Many gamma rays around it
Van Allen Belt surrounds it
This is the Space Age
Please don't worry
This is the Space Age
Just don't worry
This is the Space Age
Others like you
Ahhh ahhh..........
