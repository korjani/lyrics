We're in the basement, learning to print
All of it's hot!
10-20-30 million ready to be spent
We're stackin' 'em against the wall
Those gangster presidents

Livin' simple and trying to get by
But honey, prices have shot through the sky
So I fixed up the basement
With what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars
And heavy equipment
We're in the basement...

10-20-30 million dollars
Ready to be spent

Walk into the bank, try to pass that trash
Teller sees and says "Uh-huh that's fresh as grass"
See the street pass under your feet
In time to buy the latest model getaway Jeep

So I fixed up the basement
With what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars
And heavy equipment
We're in the basement

So I fixed up the basement
With what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars
And heavy equipment
We're in the basement,
Learning to print
All of it's hot
All counterfeit
