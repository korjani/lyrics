I am doing my housework
Got no time to fool 'round
I am doing my housework
CLeanin' up and I'm gettin' down

It'll be so clean
You can eat off the floor
You can eat off the wall
Or anywhere at all
'Cause I'll make this place
A party pad for two
And I'm not stoppin' 'til I do

I'm so tired of this vacuum
Need a man to help soon
Don't need a man to make a move on me
I need a man to move in with me

Don't need a man to treat me mean
I need a man to help me clean

Someone who's heaven sent
Someone to help pay rent
Someone to share dreams and wishes
Someone to help me do the dishes
