You know what I say to your hot pants? 
Say what?

'Cause what I see I ain't believin' 
The longest legs in the shortest pants 
You got me doin' a matin' dance 
Pant pant 
You got me pantin' like a dog

You burned a hole in my mind 
When I saw your cute behind 
Wearin' those hot pants 
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants 
Sizzlin' hot hot pants 
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants 

Sap's up spring's on the rise 
I'm bustin' out my tube top tonight 
Workin' the night shift, I get off at three 
Breakin' out of that factory 
Thunder thighs-hangn' out! 
Moon beams, dancin' about 

If you would be so kind 
Put on those red hot pants and take a stroll through my mind 

Hot pants, hot hot hot pants, hot pants 
Sizzlin' hot hot pants 
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants 

Hot pants explosion 
At the factory

Chokin' on the sizzle you deliver in that outfit so smokin' 
Hot pants flare up

But I never saw nothin' so hot as you in your hot pants 
Sizzlin' hot hot pant

Hot pants on a cute little butt yeah

Marchin' down the railroad tracks in hot pants 
Hot pants stretchin' tight

Hot pants, they're gettin' so hot
