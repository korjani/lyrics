I wish to see your lips
Parting like the waves of silence and mystery
I've got a curious love-for you!
Ever since we met I'm so impressed with you
Ever since we met
I've been so impressed!

I'm havin' a vision
I'm havin' a vision
I can't wait forever-(I can't wait, I can't wait)
I'm havin' a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips
But I can wait 'till the twelfth of never
Don't shatter the vision
Don't shatter the vision
The burning vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

Been lonely for so long
My life jumped the track
Broken clock on the wall says I should head back
But the vision holds me
The vision holds me
Lost in a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

Every time you speak
A pearl falls in my cup
You turn away, the pearl melts before I drink it up
No-don't shatter the vision
Don't shatter the vision
Lost in a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

I'm havin' a vision
I'm havin' a vision
I can't wait forever-(I can't wait, I can't wait)
I'm havin' a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips
But I can wait 'till the twelfth of never
Don't shatter the vision
Don't shatter the vision
The burning vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

Srong wind is blowin' me down
To the center of town
Come on, seize the wilderness of the moment
Feel the movement of the moon-
swans fly with wings wide open to the sky
Like a wild wave of birds goin' by
I know our souls will fly!

Things are out of focus
My face is wet with sweat
Though I've only seen you once
Just see how shaky I get
Would you even notice?
Would you even care?
I f you knew that every day I'm sitting there

I'm havin' a vision
I'm havin' a vision
I can't wait forever-(I can't wait, I can't wait)
I'm havin' a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips
But I can wait 'till the twelfth of never
Don't shatter the vision
Don't shatter the vision
The burning vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

Vision of a kiss
A vision
A vision
A vision
A vision of a kiss

I'm havin' a vision
I'm havin' a vision
I can't wait forever-(I can't wait, I can't wait)
I'm havin' a vision of a kiss from your sweet lips
But I can wait 'till the twelfth of never
Don't shatter the vision
Don't shatter the vision
The burning vision of a kiss from your sweet lips

Every time you speak
A pearl falls in my cup
You turn away, the pearl melts before I drink it up
The mystery unfolds...
