Millions of trees
Don't chop them down
See them growing for miles around
I like the rainclouds
I like the heat
Don't want parched earth burning my feet
I like the jungle
I like its style
Keep it growing, keep it wild
Let it grow for miles and miles and miles

All the creatures big and small
I don't go hunting 'cause I like them all
In the jungle. In the jungle
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
You've got an axe to grind? Don't grind it here
'Cause juicy jungle's getting smaller year after year

Vines and plants in the wild
Let them grow for miles and miles in every direction
All the creatures big and small
I don't need a gun 'cause I like them all
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
You've got an axe to grind? Don't grind it here
'Cause juicy jungle's getting smaller year after year

I may never see it, but I don't care
As long as I know that it's gonna grow
As long as I know that it's still there

I like the jungle
I like it wild
Let it grow in every direction for miles and miles
In every direction for miles and miles
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear
You've got an axe to grind? Don't grind it here
'Cause juicy jungle's getting smaller year after year
Juicy jungle's gonna disappear leave it alone
Leave it alone
Keep it wild
