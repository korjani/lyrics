Waitin' for bus #99
Goin' to the store for hot dogs and wine!
When all of a sudden, I felt real cold
And wound up in the belly of a big ol' UFO
On the bus, to the plane
To the UFO and to outer space baby
On the bus, to the plane, baby yeah
Take me away

Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
Is that you Mo-Dean?
On a UFO
Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
The interdimensional outer space being

Movin' through the spheres, faster than light
On our way to some planets that were outta sight
We said space driver, give it a spin
And take us to some places we ain't never been

On the bus, to another plane
To the UFO and outer space baby
On the bus, to the plane, baby yeah!
Take me away

Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
Is that you Mo-Dean?
On a UFO
Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
The interdimensional outer space being

Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean!

I say at which depot do we depart from this UFO?
Well it had been 987 years in outer space time when I got back
Couldn't seem to find any of my friends to tell my interesting stories to
Past life

On the bus, to the plane
To the UFO and outer space baby
On the bus, to the plane
Baby yeah!
Take me away

Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
Is that you Mo-Dean?
On a UFO
Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
The interdimensional outer space being

Is that you Mo-Dean?
It's me Mo-Dean
