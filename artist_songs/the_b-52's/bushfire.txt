On the horizon, the landscape's burning red
Bushfire---smoke in your eyes... smoke in your eyes
If you feel something, that makes you warm all over
If you got a fire and you can't put it out---got a bushfire
Rolling through a field of molten flowers
Burning in a field of molten flowers
There's a bushfire---there's a bushfire burning---yeah

Bushfire! Bushfire! Bushfire!

My mind's been going places without me lately
I need your arms to take me down, take me to the ground
But I hold back! Get away from the heat
Hold back! In my field of vision
Hold back! Baby burning---fire

Fire in a field of molten flowers,
Fire in a field of molten flowers
There's a bushfire burning---yeah.
You better hold back! Hold back!

Bushfire! Bushfire! Bushfire!

Well I'm movin' to the beat of a big bushfire
I'm dancin' to the beat of a big bushfire
And the flames are warm and getting brighter

Well everybody loves to dance around the heat and fire
Oh lightnin' strike twice
Hey everybody bask in the afterglow---Bushfire
Naked light shining over my bed, been lying here too long
I need your arms to take me down, take me to the ground

But I hold back---get away from the heat!
Hold back! In my field of vision
Hold back! I see smoke---smoke in your eyes

Bushfire! Bushfire! Bushfire!
The landscape's burning, red hot!
