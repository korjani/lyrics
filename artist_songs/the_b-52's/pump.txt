I look at you and I'm ready to pump
Luminous heartthrob ready to jump

Mama's dancin' with jellybone
You better watch out
Take you to the freak zone

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Hard kiss – love chain
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up – yeah

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump – I'm a runaway train
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up

Get serious get off the phone
Talk to me and make me moan
I said baby lose that phone
Rock me down to the jellybone

Motor runnin' double time
Machine is hummin'
Your body's mine
Dancin' in the street and we're havin' fun
Don't drop the beat
Electric drum

Chartreuse glow is maxin' out
Electric love – electric luau
I'm bustin' loose – pumpin' the music
Let's dance, baby
Let's dance – jellybone

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Hard kiss – love chain
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up – yeah

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump – I'm a runaway train
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up

Mama's dancin' - electric luau
Barefootin' – and kahootin'
With a wild crowd
Well, wild crowd

Electric eel, that's the feeling
Lines cross, lips heating
Lick my belly – turn to jelly
Spread me thin – I'm in!

I'm in it
I'm on it
I'm in it
I'm on it
I'm out
I'm in
I'm out
I'm in

Shake that jelly - rattle them bones
Dance to the rhythm that will make you moan

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Hard kiss – love chain
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up – yeah

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump – I'm a runaway train
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up
