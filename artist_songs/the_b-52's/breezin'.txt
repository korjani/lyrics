I don't need a reason
I am just breezin'
Makin' changes as they come
Ain't gonna bother anyone
Give and let live
Love and be loved
We're workin' on a positive vibe
So let the love rise to the top
Up here where the breezes blow
Don't let the love flow over stop
We got to get it together
With everyone else
We caan't make it to the positive side
Without some help
Breezin'
Let's flow
Breezin'
Let's flow
I'm ready to go
I don't need a reason
I don't need a reason

I'll hold up the roof, if you steady the walls
We'll sweep the floor, fix the house
Let  the waves roll through the door
Yeah I'll hold up the roof, if you steady the walls
We'll sweept the floor, fix the house
Let the waves roll through the door
Send a message put up your antennae tonight
Get the message put up your antennae tonight
We got to get it together
With everyone else
We can't make it to the positive side
Without some help
This is the turning point
The point of no return-
We got to come together!
Give and let live
Love and be loved

I don't need a reason
I'm breezin'
I don't need a reason
I'm breezin'
I'm breezin'
