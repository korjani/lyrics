6060-842!

Tina went to the Lady's room
Saw written on the wall
"If you'd like a very nice time
Just give this number a call"

It was 6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you

Tina reached in her pocketbook
Pulled out a thin dime
Dropped it in the phone slot
Prayin' she'd get the line

It was 6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you

Dial the number to call
Get no answer at all
Dime's in the slot
Ready to trot

Uh, 6060-842
I've been tryin' all day
And I'm makin' no headway
Operator, what's wrong?
I dial stupid number all day long

Operator said,
Your number's been disconnected
Your number's been disconnected
Your number's been disconnected
Your number's been disconnected

Hello?
I'm sorry
Hello?
I'm sorry
Hello?
I'm sorry
