There is a sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay
Sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay

There's a beach
Oh I hope it's not out of reach
It's very beautiful
Come my little peach

Together we'll go down to nude beach
Together we'll stroll on the sand
We'll stroll on the sand together
Where the air and the land meet forever
The sea, the land
A land of tan

We know a place where we are free
We throw our suits into the sea

There is a sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay
Sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay

Bop bop bop boodha bah da da
Bop bop bah da bah da
Bop bop bop boodha bah da da
Bop bop bah da bah da

Please take my hand. You are a woman
I am a man

This place is so remote, everything is revealed
It's so mysterious
Here I must stay forever

Together we'll go down to nude beach
Together we'll stroll on the sand
We'll stroll on the sand together
Where the air and the land meet forever
The sea, the sand
A land of tan

There is a sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay
Sand bar in your mind
Sand bar in the bay
