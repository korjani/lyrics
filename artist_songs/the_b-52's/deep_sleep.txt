Walking backwards into the sea
Bodies, Angels, like musical peaks
Dreamed up by you and me in our sleep
You come walking over pillows and sheets

Walking backwards into the night
Caught tight in the sheets
Our dreams entangled twisted by our heat
You come walking over pillows and sheets
It's the coldest part of the night
