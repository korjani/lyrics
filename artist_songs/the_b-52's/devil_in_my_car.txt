He's at the wheel,
HELP! The devil's in my car.

I can't put on my safety belt.
There's nothing for me to do but yell HELP!
Devil's in my car!

I don't know which way.
Oh, HELP! Devil's in my car!

He's got his cloven hoof on the clutch.
Oh! Ow! I'm sitting on his tail.

Oh-Ohh, I don't wanna go to Hell.
(I don't wanna go to the devil.)
He's in my car, in my car, in my car.

The radio gives me static,
there's nothing on my CB.
Oh, HELP! the devil's in my car.
