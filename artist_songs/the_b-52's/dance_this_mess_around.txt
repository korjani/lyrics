Remember when you held my hand 
Remember when you were my man 
Walk talk in the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Think it over, think it over 
Roll it over in your mind 
Why don't you dance with me 
I'm not no Limburger 
Just a limburger 

Dance this mess around 
Dance this mess around, 'round, 'round 

Everybody goes to parties 
They dance this mess around 
They do the Shu-ga-loo 
Do the Shy Tuna 
Do the Camel Walk 
Do the Hip-o-crit 

Ah-Hippy Hippy forward Hippy Hippy 
Hippy Shake, Hippy Shake 

Oh-it's time to do 'em right 
Hey now, don't that make you feel a whole lot better? 
Huh? 
I say, don't that make you feel a whole lot better 

What you say? 
I'm just askin' 

Shake-Bake-Shake-Bake 

Everybody goes to parties 
They dance this mess around 
They do all 16 dances 
Do the Coo-ca-choo 
Do the Aqua-velva 
Do the Dirty Dog 
Do the Escalator 

Ah-Hippy Hippy forward Hippy Hippy 
Hippy Shake, Hippy Shake 

It's time to do 'em right 
Hey! Fred, now don't that make you feel a whole lot better now? 
Huh? 

Say, don't that make you feel a whole lot better? 

What you say? 
I'm just askin' 

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Dance, dance, dance this mess around 
Dance this mess around 

Shake, shake-a-bake shake 
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
Dance this mess around 
Yeah, yeah, yeah........
