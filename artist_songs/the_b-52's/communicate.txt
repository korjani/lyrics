Let loose
Before it causes problems
Let loose
Before it tears you apart
Let loose
Let loose

You gotta reach out - Reach out and touch someone
You gotta reach out - Reach out and touch someone

Boy (Oh girl) you better communicate
Before it's too late
You better start talking
You better talk
Let loose
Before it causes problems
Let loose
Before it tears you apart

Don't bottle it up
Don't bottle it up
Like a bottle of pop
A bottle of 7-Up
You better let it
Talk from your heart and not just your brain
Talk from your heart and not just your brain

C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-E

Talk from your heart and not just your brain
Talk from your heart and not just your brain

C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-E
(Your brain that is)
