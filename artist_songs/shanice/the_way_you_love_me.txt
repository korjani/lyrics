It always seems so hard to talk about it 
Somethin' about the way you make me feel 
Lets me know that I can do without it 
Lets me know that love is, oh, so real 

I love the way you love me 
I love the way you do 
I love the way you love me 
And for always, my love, it's forever true 

Life is a breeze, the sun is always shinin' 
Nothin? is wrong whenever you're around 
Whatever I do there's something there remindin' 
Of the beautiful friend in you that I found 

I'm never alone, you're there when I need you 
To keep me from all of the things I feel 
I want you to know I could never leave you 
It makes me feel good to know that you are near, whoa...whoa... 

I love the way you love me 
I love the way you do (The way you do) 
I love the way you love me 
And for always, my love, it's forever true 

I love the way you love me (Love the way you love me) 
I love the way you do (The way you do, boy) 
I love the way you love me 
And for always, and for always my love 

I love the way you love me 
I love the way you do (The way you do) 
I love the way you love me 
And for always, my love, oh... 

I love the way you love me 
I love the way you do (The way you do) 
I love the way you love me
