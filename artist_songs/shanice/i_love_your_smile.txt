Sitting in my class, just drifting away 
staring into the windows of the world (yeah) 
I can't hear the teacher, his books don't call me at all 
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play... 

[Chorus]
'Cause I love your smile 
I love your smile 

The clock at work says three, and I wanna be free 
free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint my toes all day 
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay 
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Time came and showed me your direction 
Now I know I'll never ever go back taught me that 
I can be a better girl with love you give 
you rock my world 
you dig 

[Rap Breakdown:]
I'm showin' the life that I'm livin' 
This is the life that I have 
and it's given to you 

yeh' and it's true 
la-d-da 
twinkely d 
do you 

believe in a girl 
like me 
Shanice is the one 
for you to be with 

But when I'm caught all alone 
I start fessin' 
It's from a state of depression 

And the thunder clouds of doubt move in 
I begin to wonder "do you still love me?" 
but after that 
My whole world is beautiful 

Blow Branford 
Blow 

[Bridge]

Smile...Psych 

[Chorus]
