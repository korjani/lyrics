If you're not 
In love with me 
Why do you 
Pretend to be 
Could it be 
It's all just a game 
To you 

I put all 
Of my faith in you 
Trying to be 
What you wanted 
Me to 
Still it seems 
It's all just a game 
To you 

I've tried hard 
To understand it 
I don't know 
Whether or not 
You planned it 
Can't you see 
That love is made 
For two 

If you go 
I won't regret 
Won't spend time 
Trying hard to forget 
I'll just know 
It was all just a game 
To you 

I've tried hard 
To understand it 
Oh no 
I don't know 
Whether or not 
You planned it 
Can't you see 
That love is made 
For two 
That love is made 
For two 
That love is made 
For two 
But it's all just a game 
To you
