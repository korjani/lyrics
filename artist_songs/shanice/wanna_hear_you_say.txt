Last night we made love 
You called my name 
And the next morning things weren't the same 
Even though you stole my pride 
I just can't understand why 
My heart and my mind and my soul still love you 

[Hook]
I wanna hear you say that you love me 
I wanna hear you say you care for me 
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me 
That's the way it's supposed to be 
And deep inside I know I can't let go 
But there's one thing I got to know 
Will you be there for me? 
Like the way it's supposed to be 

Correct me if I'm wrong 
But this don't feel right 
How could you break my heart 
And leave this good woman 
See I can stand the pain 
After all the love I gave 
You took it, smiled and walked away oh baby 

Three days passed and there were no phone calls 
I was starting to get this feeling 
You weren't feeling me at all 
The time we spent, boy it don't make sense 
That I've fallen in love again 
And I don't quite understand why 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I just don't know why you won't 
Say you love me 
Why you don't care enough 
Not enough to call me 
Why 

[Hook]
