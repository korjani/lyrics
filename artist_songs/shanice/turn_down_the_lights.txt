I was feeling kinda lonely 
And I wanted you to hold me tight 
So you better come quickly 
Come on over to my house tonight 
I'm gonna look real sexy 
Gonna be your fantasy 
I'll be your lady cause you're so good to me 

But first, we'll let the music play 
Dancing nice and slow 
I'll kiss you and say 
How much I want you baby 
Boy you know you're driving me crazy 
I love the way you dance 
Baby it's time for romance 

[Chorus]
So turn down the lights 
Come close to me 
I'll give you all that you need 
Turn down the lights 
Baby and I'll be your fantasy 

Ooh I like it when you hold me 
When you hold me in your arms like this 
And you rock me gently baby 
I feel the passion burning when we kiss 
You make me feel so sexy 
Oh so good inside 
I'll be your lady 
I'll be yours tonight 

But first, we'll let the music play 
Dancing nice and slow 
I'll kiss you and say 
How much I want you baby 
Boy you know you're driving me crazy 
I love the way you dance 
Baby it's time for romance 

[Chorus]

When I'm with you 
I'm on top of the world 
Knowing your my man 
And I'm your girl 
Something about the way you love me baby 
Wouldn't change if I could 
I've got to have your right now 
Cause you feel so good 

[Chorus]
