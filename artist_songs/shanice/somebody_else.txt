Baby it all got started in the month of June 
And that's when I noticed a change in you 
You never spend any time with me like we used to 
Forget telling me that you love me 
Cause I'm not buying it 
And baby it's no mystery that you're lying to me 
You can't run that one on me 

I know on the low, you've been around 
You think you're fooling me 
I can see so easily 
I don't have you mentally, so tell me 

[Hook]
Whatcha thinking 'bout, what's on your mind? 
Baby don't keep wasting all my time 
Cause your body's here but I know 
That your mind is on somebody else 
It's feelings you can't hide 
Baby I'm not afraid to be alone 
So pack your things, it's time for you to go 
Cause your body's here but I know 
That your mind is on somebody else 
I got to let you go 

Tell me why you slipped and called me Regina 
(Why, why, why) 
Tell me who is she and why are you laying here with me 
(Oh, oh) 
Tell me what is lipstick doing on your collar 
Don't try to say that it's mine 
Cause I heard that old line 
You can't run that one on me 

You've know all along, you've been around 
You think you're fooling me 
I can see so easily 
Even someone blind can see, so tell me 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you wanna to be a player 
Then bye-bye, see you later 
Cause I don't want you 
I'd rather be alone 

[Hook]
