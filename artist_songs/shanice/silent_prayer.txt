I send to you, my silent prayer
before I sleep at night
I send to you, my silent prayer
baby, so you'll be all right

Every moment I think of you
I just can't shake up my dreams, oh no
I read the paper and watch the news
I don't know what it means

When you do what you got to do
You must know that I'm there with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
silent prayer

[Chorus]

Silent prayer (silent prayer)
Silent prayer (silent prayer)
Silent prayer (I send to you my silent prayer)

I hold a picture of a golden sunset (yeah)
and I'll take you're hand (take my hand)
we're gonna walk down that promise road
just like we planned (just like we planned)

Cause I know what I'm gonna do
Just as soon as I'm back with you
every breath that I take,
I hope and I pray sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
silent prayer

[Chorus]

I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent (baby) prayer (every hour)
my silent prayer

[Chorus]
