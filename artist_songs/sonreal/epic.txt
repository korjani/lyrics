[Verse 1 - Sonreal:]
I write songs
I don't write for the hype
Don't write for the light type ones
I drop bombs
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm
I'm copping what I'm wanting, motherfucker (we gone)
We go!
Y'all know my steelo, hero
Save my city from them cheese-o, b-roll
Homie, I'm singing my ass off like I'm Cee-Lo
Ladi dadi dadi they just wanna party
But my un-political ass
Keep on spitting, shit retardy
I don't rap about generic shit
Don't rap about Bugattis
Or rap about rapping circles
Round rappers, I'm bout it, bout it

Do it for the fans, don't do it for the shine
Don't do it for the ups, I do it for the grind
Don't do it for the moment, I do it for the time, now
You can never really say when I'm in my prime, now
My uppity ups don't mean a lot
When I'm diggidie down's when y'all seem to pop
Without them you'd probably wouldn't be a lot
Just a normal ass kid who dream a lot
Fuck boys, don't see a lot
Keep telling me that I don't keep a G a lot
Cause I don't talk about giving chicks D a lot
I guess being myself is who I be a lot

What is real, what is real, what is real
I don't know, I guess before I leave
That's something you gon'feel

[Chorus:]
Whoa
I said it, yeah I said it
Whoa
Shit's epic, yeah the shit's epic
Whoa
I said it, yeah I said it
Whoa
Shit's epic, yeah the shit's epic

[Verse 2 - Sonreal:]
This dream I believe in
I guess I had my own reasons
I was cheifin every evening
Mom callin plus my phone beepin
I ain't pick it up, I ain't pick it up
Want to live it really, but I never live it up
Matter of fact, I've been thinking about giving up
But my homie tell me that I'm realy I'll as fuck
So I wrote the hook down
Barely look down
All it took now
Was a good sound
Write the bars, and layed her down
And when I layed her down I just played her loud
Like

{What if I just told you right now
Everything you ever wanted, you can have it}

That right there, that's why I do this
I was gonna be the coolest!
Now, motherfucker, be the truest
I wake up in the morning, I ain't gotta be a different body
Went and turned the mic on, and when you gotta nikon
Aimin in my face with the flash with the light on
I'm the one to give a writer something here to bite on
Say cheese for the cameraman
You know bro's just rappin for his grandma man
Got hits like ram jam bam a lam
And I ain't stoppin til my momma see's a grammy man like
Hey, extra extra, don't read the text, the performance's better
You can check the show, and get your critique on
And we can feel the vibe, and sing it all together like
Hey, doctor doctor, don't cure my ass before I divide and conquer
Ex-haters sayin that my flow is bonkers
You wanted real then don't wait no longer

[Chorus:]
(It's about time for the tango)

One long day turn to one long dream, dream
Yeah the show well it ain't what it seem, seem

No this ain't here no party music, but you can party to it
Everything I do I put my heart into it
But you can party to it

No this ain't here no party music, but you can party to it
Everything I do I put my hear into it
But you can party to it

Whoa, I said it, yeah I said it
Whoa, Shits epic, yeah shit's epic

Whoa, I said it, yeah I said it
Whoa, Shits epic, yeah shit's epic
