[Intro - SonReal:]
Can you give me something to believe in?
Can you, can you give me something to believe in?
Can you?

[Verse 1 - SonReal:]
Used to believe that I could be a pro at anything
Started down the street at just another shitty skating rink
Dad took his son there, teach his boy to slap shot
So he'll make the team you know I'll fuck 'em with my hands off
That turned to skating and the skating just turned to rappin'
Shit ain't changed, I still got the same motive to make it happen
Like feeling on the far side, tryna get a little closer
Cause they know I got a flow that be draining on all these hoses
From that city where if you rappin' ain't no one who gonna know you
But we got enough talent to wake 'em up with no Folgers
So I believe, that's what I tell 'em when they ask
And that's the reason I started whopping ass like
Rappers say my name in their songs, I don't even bother
Cause the level that they on don't even worth coming back harder
Plus I be tryna build my legacy off what I tend to be
Not off doing shit so outlandish you remember me like

[Bridge 1:]
Oh, I just do it for my city and the people at the shows who really be fucking with me
Oh, I just do it for the fizz act, if you needing this shit then you ain't gotta do is ask

[Hook:]
If I gave you something to believe in
Could you say my name?
And if you gave me something to believe in
Could I do the same?
Like, if I make you smile, if I make you smile
I've done my job at last
And if you make me smile, if you make me smile
Then we all gonna laugh
Can you give me something to believe in?
Can you, can you give me something to believe in?
Can you?

[Bridge 2:]
Like if I make you smile, if I make you smile
I've done my job at last
And if you make me smile, if you make me smile
Then we all gonna laugh

[Verse 2 - SonReal:]
Used to believe that I can be a pro at anything
Started at the skate park, jumping down that hammer lane
Bust my elbow open three times 'fore I perfected it
From that moment on I was gonna get respected
Shit ain't changed, I still got the same ambition
All my flaws, I just flip 'em round and use 'em as ammunition
Just a little kid bumping Cube up in the kitchen
While my parents wasn't home cause the swearing had 'em tripping
But he made me believe and believing was all I needed so
When I close my eyes I can see what I was dreaming, oh
This shit ain't no rocket science, I been on my rocket ship
Been a long time coming so let them fool who just talking shit
Last year I felt I went harder than most
So when we get it poppin' this year don't treat me like a joke
You was that red swallow that started up the bravado
My city gave me the lead so I knew that I'd never follow like

[Bridge 1:]
Oh, I just do it for my city and the people at the shows who really be fucking with me
Oh, I just do it for the fizz act, if you needing this shit then you ain't gotta do is ask

[Hook:]
If I gave you something to believe in
Could you say my name?
And if you gave me something to believe in
Could I do the same?
Like, if I make you smile, if I make you smile
I've done my job at last
And if you make me smile, if you make me smile
Then we all gonna laugh
Can you give me something to believe in?
Can you, can you give me something to believe in?
Can you?

[Bridge 2:]
Like if I make you smile, if I make you smile
I've done my job at last
And if you make me smile, if you make me smile
Then we all gonna laugh

[Outro - Sonreal:]
Wiz Khalifa laugh
You know I feel like we getting a lot closer
Hmm, never been one for the band wagon
Always been on train when the pants saggin'
And in my head I was visualizing them fans waving
To the words that I wrote, to the words that you know
From the word believe to the words we go
I've never been amazing, I'm just hungry
That's the reasoning behind all of my struggles
They feel what you be believing and I share with you my story
Through this broken chair I'm seated in, a C- student
But they say I'm on some genius shit, let the beat ride, let the beat ride
Let me speak my BAD 'fore IDIE, I gotta show you something throughout my three eye
On my third eye, let my words fly'like a pelican, cocky but I'm elegant
So tell me why this motherfucker raising hell again
Momma told me use just what you got
I got 'em feeling Nemo as soon as my chorus stop
Stop, no, drop, yes, that's me, what's up?
They say that they ready so I serve 'em like a butler
I saw rappers pass me, they was moving like a trucker
So I switch my gears, hope I ain't going like no sucker
Truth be told my truth ain't the same when the truth be told
So when the truth get dropped start moving slow until they gravitate and start lose control
Like I could lose it all and barely feel a bruise at all
I'd rather fail at trying than never even go try at all
And if I write that classic shit then I ain't gotta die at all
Homie, I ain't gotta die at all
Believe
