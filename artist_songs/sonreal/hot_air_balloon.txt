You got me higher than a hot air balloon
Gave me fireworks on 4th of July
Went out all night so we can sleep until noon
But when I woke up, you weren't right by my side
I got gold, I got rings, I got jewels, I got things
But none of that could ever buy me love
No, no, not me
I got food, I got plates, I got a table that I made
But none of that could ever buy me love, love, love, nah, nah

Before I met you, all I cared about was music
Now I got writer's block, so me and her just watch movies
Even when to go meet daddy, I was hung the hell over
He asked what I do for work, showed him my rapping diploma
But mister, don't you be worried, daddy, I promise I'm good
If her car break down, I promise I'll get right under the hood
So before I get on one knee, can I have you approve?
She interrupts and said, "Sorry, honey, we're through"
But baby

You got me higher than a hot air balloon
Gave me fireworks on 4th of July
Went out all night so we can sleep until noon
But when I woke up, you weren't right by my side
I got gold, I got rings, I got jewels, I got things
But none of that could ever buy me love
No, no, not me
I got food, I got plates, I got a table that I made
But none of that could ever buy me love, love, love, nah, nah

Pull out the driveway, feeling like a hoser
Stopped my c-car a block down, then whip a u-ie back over
You know that feeling that you get when you hit by a bulldozer
That's how I felt when she told me we're done
I don't wanna go out like a chump, no, no, not me
So I get right in daddy's face and say I'm sorry to be
The one your daughter fell in love with, she'll attest that is true
She look at me and say, "I fell in love, but just not with you"
But baby

You got me higher than a hot air balloon
Gave me fireworks on 4th of July
Went out all night so we can sleep until noon
But when I woke up, you weren't right by my side
I got gold, I got rings, I got jewels, I got things
But none of that could ever buy me love
No, no, not me
I got food, I got plates, I got a table that I made
But none of that could ever buy me love, love, love, nah, nah

I know you think you know me, think you know me very well
And I ain't to be the bearer of bad news, but I can tell
It ain't you, it's me, I'm sorry, truly sorry, but oh well
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You got me higher than a hot air balloon
Gave me fireworks on 4th of July
Went out all night so we can sleep until noon
But when I woke up, you weren't right by my side
I got gold, I got rings, I got jewels, I got things
But none of that could ever buy me love
No, no, not me
I got food, I got plates, I got a table that I made
But none of that could ever buy me love, love, love, nah, nah
