Woke up this mourning trying to write what's on my heart
But it seem my heart ain't fuckin with my pen
So, I grab my keys I'm a go and drive it off as I'm driving I get pulled over again

He say you over the speed limit, I say I thought I was within it
Then he give my ass a ticket like a punk

I just kinda shake it off like 200 bucks is soft
Then I go and hit Duffin's to get some lunch
I'll get the number four with a side of chicken tend
Throw some hot sauce up on that, Never just a little bit

Then I hit studio give to you what I'm thinking in my head
But the shit I've been thinking in my head ain't really feeling all that pimp today
So I be scribbling down what I've been crumbling up
And as I'm crumbling up I've been mumbling stuff that I don't really give a fuck to say

Like, I'm the man I'm a blow like you already know, Naw that sounds weak
My homie's like why don't you go home and get some sleep
Grab my shit and pack my bag then I say peace out
Instead of going home I'll just show up at your house and say

[Hook:]
How long would you wait
If I said there's no tomorrow and all we had was today
So baby let's let's go to L.A
Where all them dreams are made of and we can't find us no shade (I ask you)
How, How long would you wait
If I said there's no tomorrow and all we had was today
So baby let's let's go to L.A
Where all them dreams are made of and we can't find us no shade

We hit the road again hit the gas then we rollin right
My fans keep thinking I'm a blow like fucking overnight
Since eight days ago I haven't had a sober night
That sounds cool right (Welcome to my new life)

Lights camera then act man my life just like a movie
I was feeling so on fire like a never ending doobie
Till I try and catch the bus and I ain't even got a toonie
I'm like can a get a ride, she like no you gotta pay
I'm like usually I have fare but today just ain't my day, she like no way, I'm like okay

(Uh) walking in the rain
Feel it falling on my brain
Got me feeling little bit inspired
So I walk all the way home
Put some music on and zone
Then I wrote this shit you now call fire

Yeah, One long day, one long day, yeah that be what my life about
One long day, one long day, probably be what your life about
Excitement is something I can't live my life without
So I pack my bags and show up at your house screaming out screaming out, screaming out like

[Hook:]
How long would you wait
If I said there's no tomorrow and all we had was today
So baby let's let's go to L.A
Where all them dreams are made of and we can't find us no shade (I ask you)
How, How long would you wait
If I said there's no tomorrow and all we had was today
So baby let's let's go to L.A
Where all them dreams are made of and we can't find us no shade
