[Verse 1:]
She a nerd
Yeah she a geek
Always stay at home
Phone never beep
Hardly ever speak so you take her for confused
But she's just particular with the words that she choose
Never wear makeup, so girls say she ugly
Call her a lesbian because she ain't slutty
That right there make the cleanest girl feel so muddy
Makes it hard to say "yes I'm a be somebody"
But she did, she kept on walkin'
Through these cold halls where the people keep talkin'
Deja-vu, the paper planes keep flockin'
She just play deaf to blind peeps stalkin'
Couple years pass by and them braces come off
Figure vivacious and her skin so soft
Every dude want her and them girls just got
Cause' they ain't got what she got
It's kinda funny how things switch
Karma is a bitch
To this day I know this girl and where she live
She doin' better than ever, a certified queen
She overcame the eyes of the victim teen

[Hook 1:]
Say, you can try
But you're never gonna' break me down
I say, you can try
But you're never gonna break me down

[Verse 2:]
He a nerd
Yeah he a geek
Always stay at home
Phone never beep
Hardly ever speak so you take him for confused
But he's just particular with the words that he choose
Got his own bully, take his lunch every week
Stuff him into lockers, tie him to a tree
Pull his pants down, kick his ass in P.E
If only this motherfucker know who this kid be
He probably get his autograph, right now, just like me
Professional pianist but wrists too sore to play a key
So when he got home, pop an Advil and get goin'
Replicate it all Mozart to Beethoven
Now he the rick rule but enough composin'
Play these keys here on this record that I'm flowin'
Doin' better than ever, a certified king
Cause' he overcame the eyes of the victim teen

[Hook 1 x2]

[Hook 2 x2:]
I can try
But I'm never gonna break you down
I say, I can try
But I'm never gonna break you down
