Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Fuck it, let's get it then
Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?

I got too much on my plate
I second guess nothing for nothing
I throw this rap out the window
I'll make another like nothing
We built this shit from the ground up
I don't ask questions, I solve 'em
I'll get some money, then I'll spend it
But don't rap like I'm balling
My time ain't nothing but now now
My team been going from pow wows
I'll give 'em shit so real, the DJ's 'bout to do triple salchows
Yeah, I've been singing and rapping
Rapping and singing and such
I look around, these dudes be focused on their look like too much
And I think it's time I calm it down just a little
Just a little, just a little... nah, fuck it
I don't believe in predictions, I just believe in conviction
And since I quit all my bitching, I heard 'em all start to listen

Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Fuck it, let's get it then
Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?

Don't trip like KC and Jojo
You know this bro goin' pro though
I'll rock a jean jacket with a jean shirt and some jeans at the Soho
I don't fit in with no genre
I got some screws loose, it's true
Pops got that snare, make you drop like when Kendrick go doo doo
I made some boo boos to move you
I guess that's how I got through, though
My team ain't signing no papers
This off the book, shout out joo joo
I got some shit on my sleeve
I got some dirt on my hands
I got no yes men here around me that gon' say I'm the man
So I think it's time I calm it down just a little
Just a little, just a little... nah, fuck it
I don't believe in no luck
Like they don't believe 'til it's something
I dreamt this all my sleep and never woke up to no buzzer
I'm buggin

Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Fuck it, let's get it then
Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
Oh, oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?
