I was going to go pick up the phone today
Then I said I want it, then I did
But when I called there's nobody to pick up
So I just kept on going by my shit
Couple days pass, you been on my mind
So I'll go and pick that phone just to try another time
Punch in 11 numbers just to hear your voicemail
I just wanted to shoot the shit and let you know your boys well

And I've been doing little thinking
I ain't trying to be hard headed and every moment that I'm blinking so
Because of that I think our relationship sinking
I just want to be the one to maybe help us rethink it
Maybe help us rethink it
Hold up, I hear my phone ringing
I hear your voice upon the other line
I just want to let you know without you in my life I find that

All the lights, all the fame, all the sun, over all the rain
All the gold on a million Chainz
All the love killing all the pain
All the money, all in the world
Mind all the dollars, mind all the pearls
But that all, that all, that all, that all, that all
Ain't shit without you

Hiding all my feelings in hopes that you'll never know
Putting on a front, I know that sometimes it just shows
Counted all my ducks and then I put them on a row
Never thought this feeling be something I can't control
But I been thinking a lot, maybe thinking to much
h o o k -ing up, I'm gray, relationships all suck
Maybe that's my fault, maybe that's my luck but
Maybe not being with you is something i dont want
Instead of buying flowers I just went and bought some liquor
Then I showed up at your house so I can mix us up a spritzer
Guess at this romantic shit it seems I'm a biginner but
You still think I'm cool so I guess that I'm a winner
Rejecting all this outerwear but I just need some inner
Cause I can't even find the time to take you out for dinner
And I could never explain in a couple lines
I just want you let you know without you in my life I find that

All the lights, all the fame, all the sun, over all the rain
All the gold on a million chains
All the love killing all the pain
All the money, all in the world
Mind all the dollars, mind all the pearls
But thats all, that all, that all, that all, that all
Ain't shit without you

You can give me the world on a silver plate
Walking down the street, baby, call my name
Fire bust glass with the ocean view
But none of that compares to you
Little chance ain't too hard to make
I can put together every single dollar I make
But that's all, that all, that all, that all, that all, ain't shit without you

All the lights, all the fame, all the sun, over all the rain
All the gold on a million chains
All the love killing all the pain
All the money, all in the world
Mind all the dollars, mind all the pearls
But thats all, that all, that all, that all, that all
Ain't shit without you
