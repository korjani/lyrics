Yo it's back on the top of the map now
Everybody else might wanna back down
Bout to to link with Shake and turn 2DopeBoyz
Into a certified crack house

I'm the man nigga
C.O.D. is the clan nigga
This that joint that'll make you swallow your words
If you think that I'm playin with ya

Only thing I fear is the most high
I been knocked down but I'm alright
Cause I keep that faith by my side
So there's no need for the 4-5, alright

I don't even really hear the shit ya'll talkin'
I'm runnin laps while ya'll still walkin'
Guess I'm just that man on fire
No Denzel or Christoper Walken

Don't blame me, blame God
Blame my father, blame my mother
Sorry ya'll, you know I love you
But you're the reason I'm ahead of the others

I'm thinkin' on my feet
This shit s beyond the streets
Ya'll lookin' tired
Best be careful not to fall asleep

Got me feelin' so mindless
I feel like I'm blinded
It's trouble just finding my rhythm

Everybody's so mindless
And knowledge is timeless
But they'll never find what I give em'

You got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
Got me feeling like noone answers me when I call

You got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
So I'm stuck in this mindless rhythm

OK, I got this rap thing
And I'm all good for the scrappin'
If you feel like no one pays you anymore Ma
Cause I'm more happenin'

From the boogie down Bronx
All the way down to the lower east side of Manhattan
From Brooklyn's brook over to Queens
Across to the island of Stanton

Yo these my parts
All I can do is on my heart
As I swim around these sharks
I reach high for the billboard charts

Yo Divine where you at
North Carolina's on the map
Let's drop the world on they fuck in heads
Then put that shit back on our backs

New world orders on the way
All I do these days is pray
And I know my days are numbered
But I got so much to say

So I try to slow them down
But I'm feelin so profound
My success is in my spirit
You can hear it in my sound

Got me feelin' so mindless
I feel like I'm blinded
It's trouble just finding my rhythm

Everybody's so mindless
And knowledge is timeless
But they'll never find what I give em'

Got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
You got me feeling like noone answers me when I call

You got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
So I'm stuck in this mindless rhythm

It's a wrap now, I could never back down
Got so many people rootin' for these raps now
Got me feelin' like it's more than white and black now
Guess I've come a long way, yeah [x2]

Got me feelin' so mindless
I feel like I'm blinded
It's trouble just finding my rhythm

Everybody's so mindless
And knowledge is timeless
But they'll never find what I give em'

Got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
You got me feeling like noone answers me when I call

You got me feeling like nothing baby, nothing at all
So I'm stuck in this mindless rhythm
