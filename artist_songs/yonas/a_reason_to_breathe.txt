I've been searching for a reason to live
And I don't wanna take, I want a reason to give
There's something deep inside of me that eats at my ribs
I wonder if I'll live to see me and my kids
'Cause the world's in trouble, and it's about to get a little worse
It all started when I jotted down my little verse
And that evolved into notebooks and notebooks of me
Trying to relate to the people that will feel my hurt
When I look into my soul I see the eyes of y'all
When you look into my soul, you see the eyes of God
So join me on this problem as I try to solve
And grow with me as you witness all I evolve
I'm living under the sun, and even when I'm rich I'll be at one with the slums
The greatest never rush, they just run with the drums
And live their life to the fullest, man, it's done when it's done

[Hook:]
People shouldn't speak of what they don't know
'Cause everyone's got something they don't show
And I'll be searching for a reason
A reason to live, a reason to breathe
'Cause people shouldn't speak of what they don't know
'Cause everyone's got something they don't show
And I'll be searching for a reason
A reason to live, a reason to breathe

[Brother Ali:]
Playing on the wet ground, wrapped up in a death shroud
It's gone, broken, I'm scared to let the breath out
Nasty pieces unsung, what is it I run from?
I check home to change clothes and bury loved ones
Text message saying "please call home"
Scared to pick up the phone, I'm afraid someone else is gone
I travel around the globe, they treat me like I'm holy
Not knowing I can't save the folks closest to me
I cheat 'em, I fent 'em, I leave 'em, I disappoint
I should be there for them, the road turns cold
Suicide runs through the new man side of my family
Pops master's right, I knew it was not an accident
Young widow, two little guys he left behind
Same ages as mine, he was married four times
My parents in the ground, I'm the leader of my family
They're all looking at me, but I don't have the answers
I'm just knowing that I'm supposed to gain some understanding
Hollering to God to try to figure what the plan is
Long as I'm breathing like these, 'til I cease and desist
Me and my kids got a reason to live

[Hook]

I'm just looking for a reason to wake
'Cause every morning some one's got a reason to flake
I'm driving off this cliff at a hundred miles an hour
And my only fear is I don't have a reason to brake
I'm getting lonely, Lord. This world is phoney Lord
The fuck is on me, Lord? I'm on my own at court
These niggas talking about the balleys'while they're calling Forbes
Almost like they forgot about niggas that still owning Fords
I keep a shooting to death, I can never be shallow, I'm perusing the depth
I'm using my music to improve on what's left
It's sort of like I'm moving mountains when I'm moving a cliff
I sing to find peace in the notes
Who knew the world would find a bit of peace with my quotes?
I've seen success before, it's like I'm meeting a ghost
But what's confusing is I guess I never seen it this close

[Hook]
