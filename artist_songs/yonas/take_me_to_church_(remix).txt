[Chorus - Hozier]

From here on earth
Please hear my verse
Cause yea they said it
But I said it first
So in a sense, I gave these niggas birth
That's why my fans at my show screaming Take Me To Church!

No suit and tie, but baby I go to work
Don't do it for the money but that's one of the perks
If y'all got the shovel then I've got the dirt
Burying rappers is what I mean when I say take 'em to church!
Oh man I'm back with more bars
Your girlfriend on my score card
Opportunity knocks...
Well someone please tell me where the doors are
Before I trample it nigga
Somebody better answer this nigga
If you ain't never heard of me...
I'm bout to show you what the mother fuckin anthem is nigga
Diamonds and Treasure, that don't bring me no pleasure
Every day I just wake up, saying I can do better
Tryna find me a girl to put her hands in the holes of my sweater
And truth be told I just pray that this moment last me forever
I swear I...

[Chorus - Hozier]

From here on earth
Please hear my verse
Cause yea they said it
But I said it first
So in a sense, I gave these niggas birth
That's why my fans at my show screaming Take Me To Church!

No suit and tie, but baby I go to work
Don't do it for the money but that's one of the perks
If y'all got the shovel then I've got the dirt
Burying rappers is what I mean when I say take 'em to church!
And I'm more influential, cause I'm somewhat anti governmental
And I feel like all I need is God, I don't really give a fuck if I offend you
I don't really think you know what I have been through
But that's something I'd rather not get into
Cause I can't put my life inside a pencil, and that's something I'd rather not pretend to....
Be able to do, and an 8th full of shrooms
Couldn't paint what I paint when the bass goes boom
And the lights go low, and they call it magic
Like I'm rockin a cape and a broom
Mental patient escaping the room
Now I'm out the basement headed straight for the moon
And it might be some black shit, but I feel like I'm Radio Active

[Chorus - Hozier]

From here on earth
Please hear my verse
Cause yea they said it
But I said it first
So in a sense, I gave these niggas birth
That's why my fans at my show screaming Take Me To Church!
