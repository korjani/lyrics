I'm falling off a cliff, and I ain't worried 'bout a cushion
I'm utterly in love with this limit that I'm pushin
No more talkin 'cause the proof is in the pudding
Behind a great man they say there's a better woman
So women of the world, we need you more than ever
'Cause when you heal a man you bring a nation together
And when a man is hurt he shovels you his abuse
And then we teach the kids, that's the trouble with the youth
I'm thinking about a way I can help us get the message
Maybe through my music I'll eliviate the stresses
Everything I've learned I learned from my mothers essence
And thanks to her I'm unafraid to ask the tougher questions
Believe me you, I know it's gettin' hard
The type of shit that make you not even believe in God
But listen to my words, hopefully I change the odds
'Cause the true meaning of faith is believing in your cards Awe...

Ain't nobody else gon do
The things, you do, for me and that's my word
Forget the thug in your life
When you need a little love in your life... Call me

So baby it ain't a thing just tell me what's on your mind
No hesitation there's dinner reservations at nine
Glorious love let's celebrate it with some wine
I'll look into your eyes and tell you everything is fine
'Cause everything is fine, especially you
I'll never take for granted what you blessedly do
I speak it from the heart so every message is true
And after all it is my heart that led me to you
So faith over fear, it's pretty simple and plain
I love the way you smile and how your dimples arrange
The way you find beauty in the things that are strange
And when we make love you sing in the perfect range
Sorry to be blunt, but this is all I know
Forget what's on your mind, and follow what's in your soul
Without a single word, I can feel that you know
Just like when I close my eyes I can still see you glow woah...

Ain't nobody else gon do
The things, you do, for me and that's my word
Forget the thug in your life
When you need a little love in your life... Call me

I see you baby I just wanted to
Let you know that, you've got my love
There's few women out there now days
That actually respect themselves
And hold themselves in the right light
So I just figured I'd shine a little more light your way to keep you up

Ain't nobody else gon do
The things, you do, for me and that's my word
Forget the thug in your life
When you need a little love in your life... Call me
