I do this for my culture, no image to protect
Just broken down lives and broken objects
Disgusted with how far that my greedy eyes stretch
Preoccupied with fame 'cause I'm tryin' to be the next

No famous relative to help me with my master plan
Just family members that came overseas from other lands
Shit, I'll fake a smile before I walk around depressed
Plus I want success I'm not accepting nothing less

They say a man is judged by the way that he provides
I don't wanna have to die for people to realize
Followin' a trend to me is I'll advised
'Cause the world will judge you regardless of how you feel inside

Niggas say they fly but they ain't touch the sky
They ain't even off the ground, they just talkin' from their pride
It's easy to reside in the valley where we walk
But it's harder to think before you even get to talk

Before I lay my head to go to sleep
I say a little prayer for my soldiers in the street
'Cause I don't wanna die for people to realize
I'm looking for a sign but it'll be alright [x2]

These damn gucci niggas got no love for us hoopty niggas
And all the wild groupie ladies wanna mooch our figures
Scorcese couldn't make a better movie picture
Like Mumia Abu Jamal I capture all my listeners

Freedom is relative, I'm feeling like a prisoner
Every day I'm sicker 'cause I got dropped by SIGNA
Now it's beneficial cards and mediocre service
And I'm startin' to go nuts the media's a circus

They say here's where all the meteors are headed
I love startin' drama, I'm learning how to dead it
I love doin' work and giving God all the credit
I live life wisely so I don't regret it

I'm a supernova so my aura's so magnetic
And every time I spit a verse it get's eclectic
Gotta show these skeptics they could never critic
And if they wanna get it, they could get it

Before I lay my head to go to sleep
I say a little prayer for my soldiers in the street
'Cause I don't wanna die for people to realize
I'm looking for a sign but it'll be alright [x2]
