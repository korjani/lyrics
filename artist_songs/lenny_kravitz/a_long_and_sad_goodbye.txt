Papa
Who's to blame
Why you never had your fortune and fame
Papa what did you gain
To leave the love you had for a two-bit dame

Papa
Why did you turn your back
Why didn't you stay on track
Why did you leave and make her cry

Papa
You meant the world to me
Why did you abandon me
Now it's a long and sad goodbye

Papa
What is this game
With all that cheating you did you're gonna go insane

Papa
I am in pain
'Cause on the day that you left
You said I'd do the same

Papa
Why did you turn your back
Why didn't you stay on track
Why did you leave and make her cry

Papa
You meant the world to me
Why did you abandon me
Now it's a long and sad goodbye

Papa, Papa, Papa
No
Oh Papa, Papa, oh papa
No

Oh Papa
Why did you turn your back
Why didn't you stay on track
Why did you leave and make her cry

Oh Papa
You meant the world to me
Why did you abandon me
Now it's a long and sad goodbye

Papa, Papa, Papa
No

Oh Papa
Oh Papa
Oh Papa
No no no, stay
