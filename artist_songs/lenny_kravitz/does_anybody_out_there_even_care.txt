The dream is lost 
Don't let it slip away 
Or bloody days won't be far away 
'Cause when there's no more sun 
There's no where you can run 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 

Wake up world before it's too late 
It's time for love to conquer hate 
And when the battle's won 
We all can live as one 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 

Hey 
Riots in the streets, 
Men dressed in white sheets 
Is that what we want 
Oh a little boy hanging from a tree 
And a burning cross 
If we can learn that we're one we can overcome 
Before this takes us all 
We'd better catch ourselves before we fall 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Yeah hey hey hey 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 
Does anybody out there even care
