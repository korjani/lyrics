He rode in town on a white horse 
With nothing in his hands 
He came to gather his people 
And take them to their promised land 
When he came he knew there would be bloodshed 
But still no violence made his plans 
He came to fight in a battle 
With no guns or money 

But with his empty hands 
With his empty hands 
With his empty hands 
With his empty hands 

They said hey boy what you lookin'at 
As they eyed his dreaded mane 
He said my father has sent me 
I've come back to reclaim 
The children whose hearts 
Were so whole and pure 
Now it's you who'll die in pain 
So they lynched the man 
Who fooled the word 
And all the children gathered 
In his empty hands 

In his empty hands 
The children ..... empty hands 
In his empty hands 
With his empty hands 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, ouh 
In his empty hands 

With his empty hands 
In his empty hands 
He ... the mission with his empty hands 
In his empty hands 
With his empty, his empty, empty empty hands 
With his empty hands
