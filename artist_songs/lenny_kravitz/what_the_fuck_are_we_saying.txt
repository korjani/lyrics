Will we ever understand ? 
Or is the fate of man at hands ? 
Will we live or shall we die ? 
How will we ever know if we never try ? 

The government's the devil's hands 
It's a lie and it's a scam 
They wind us up, put us down, and watch us go 
And if you close your eyes 
There's a big surprise 

What the fuck are we saying ? 
Do we feel what we dream about ? 
We've got to keep on praying 
And one day we'll see the light 

I've been lost in the name of love 
And we kill our brothers daily in the name of God 
We'd better chill before we take on some tribulation 
And if we realized 
Then we'd make a little love now sing 

What the fuck are we saying ? 
Do we believe what we read about ? 
We've got to keep on praying 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light 

What the fuck are we saying ? 
Do we believe what we dream about ? 
We've got to keep on praying 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light 
And one day we'll see the light
