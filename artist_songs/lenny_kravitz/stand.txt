Don’t give up,
You’re gonna see tomorrow
That you’ll be on your feet again
Sometimes the world’s gonna knock you over
But you will see who are your friends

Come on, stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you’re gonna run again

Your faith and patience will be your soldiers
To guide you through your troubled times
Just put one foot in front of the other
The battles are inside your mind
You have the power to face your demons
No matter how they go at time
And rid yourself of your fear and weakness
So you can start to live your life

Come on, stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you’re gonna run again

Come on, stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you’re gonna run again

Pick up your will
And put on your face
If you need to, just take my hand
It’s time to demonstrate, don’t hesitate
Just get up and say "Yes, I can"

Stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you’re gonna run again

Stand, up again
Come on, stand,
Stand, you’re gonna run again
Stand, you’re gonna run again
Stand, you’re gonna run again
