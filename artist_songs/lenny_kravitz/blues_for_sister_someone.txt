I know a girl who gets off 
By sticking needles in her vein 
Oh lord what a shame 

She's got no money so she turns tricks 
And plays dirty games 
Oh Lord spare her pain 

What she say she do to you 
You'd have to be insane 
The bathroom stall, her bedroom 
The one that's always engaged 
She sleeps and eats with the plague 

She's got a baby in her belly 
But she just don't care 
What will become of the pair 

Oh Lord what can she do 
To get the shit out her hair 
To get the shit out her hair 

Oh Lord It's not fair 
Blues for sister someone 
Oh Lord
