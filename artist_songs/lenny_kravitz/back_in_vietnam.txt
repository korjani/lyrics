We are like pirates and we are comin' with the biggest ego
We're gonna bring it down and give it to you, that's how we go
We're gonna drop from the sky like a killer tornado

Here we are again my friends
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam

We're gonna keep on riding `til the enemy's been severed
Well never turn around, we don't care if it takes forever
Men women children will die we're all in this together

Here we are again my friend
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do

We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam

We're gonna fly over the world inside a giant eagle
We do just what we want and don't care if it isn't legal
We're on a horse that is high, we think we're so damn regal

Here we are again my friend
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
Oh yeah
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
Make no mistake about it
We're back in Vietnam
We're back in Viet
Back in Vietnam
We're back in Vietnam
