Lord what's the matter 
Am I lost 
This life's a disaster, what is the cause 
Am I a junkie, what is my fate 
Or am I a flunkie who doesn't relate 
Or am I a child so full of hate 

Am I a doctor or even a priest 
Or am I a rapist who needs a release 
A psychotic prancer 
Times Square dancer 
The mind can see as long as you'll be 
For real with yourself 
And you'll forever be 

Be, be, be, be 
You'll forever be 
Be, be, be, you'll forever you be 
You'll forever be 
When you're real with yourself 
You'll forever be 

Lord what's the matter am I insame 
This life's an illusion that's all it remains 
Are you listening, are you boss 
Am I gonna make it up on that cross 
Believe in Your name and 
You'll forever be 

Be, be, be, be 
You'll forever be 
Be, be, be, you'll forever be 
Ever be, ever be 
You'll forever be 
You'll forever, ever, ever.
