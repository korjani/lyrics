Looking back on love through a broken old TV
Looking back on love but it's kind of hard to see
I'm just trying to find the place where I should be
Looking back on love, oh yeah

Looking back on love though the players have all changed
Looking back on love even though we're all estranged
Now what can we do with the feelings we've exchanged
Oh, oh yeah, looking back on love

Looking back on love in the paintings on the wall
Looking back on love it is cracked and about to fall
I should be running like a baby I still crawl, oh yeah
Looking back on love, oh

Looking back on love like a rerun in my mind
Looking back on love but it seems as if I'm blind
Holding memories like the sun that always shine
Now I need to find a love I can call mine
Oh, oh, looking back on love
Yeah

Looking back
Looking back on love

Looking back on love, wonder if I will survive
Looking back on love, it is time for me to dive
Once I go beneath will I finally be alive
Looking back on love
Looking back on love
