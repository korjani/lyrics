This is the time
This is the vibe
Don't you want to get onto the ride
Come on inside
From the outside
The truth will set you free and you will find
That there is a love
That won't let you down
And it always holds ground
Wear your crown
This love will never leave you
This love will never let you go

It is time for a love revolution
It is time for a new constitution

You are a child of the most high
There's nothing you can't do and that's no lie
You were designed to use your mind
To move what you can't see so don't be blind
'Cause there is a love
That won't let you down and it always holds ground
Wear your crown
This love will never leave you
This love will never let you go

It is time for a love revolution
It is time, it is time, for a new constitution

It is time, it is time, for a love revolution
Love revolution
It is time, it is time,  for a new constitution

It is time, it is time, for a love revolution
A love revolution
It is time, it is time, for a new constitution

It is time, it is time, for a love revolution
A love revolution
It is time, it is time, for a new constitution
