Get up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is workin' hard this year
Baby
Do the things I says to do

Baby, if you're feeling good
Baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

Honey
Don't push your man behind his years
Baby
Stop cryin' all your tears
Baby
Do the things I says to do, do it

Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
I wanna hear you, yeah
