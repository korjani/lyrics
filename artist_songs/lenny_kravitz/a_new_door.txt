I can see that look in your eyes
You're in need of something you can't find
You're tired of holding on to the pain
You haven't got the strength to hold the reigns
You are out of lane

I know you can't take it
I know you can't take it anymore
I know you can't fake it
I know you can't fake it anymore
Now it's time for you to open a new door

You fool yourself when you live a lie
You spend all of your time getting high
But drunken nights won't bury your fears
All the drinks you had just turned to tears
For too many years

I know you can't take it
I know you can't take it anymore
I know you can't fake it 
I know you can't fake it anymore
Now it's time for you to open a new door

When you think that nobody cares
Close your eyes and know that God is there
And if you reach out He'll do the same
Just ask for what you need in Jesus name
Don't be ashamed

I know you can't take it
I know you can't take it anymore
I know you can't fake it
I know you can't fake it anymore
Now it's time for you to open a new door

Now it's time for you to open a new door
