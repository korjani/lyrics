Huh, American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

Don't come hanging 'round my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you

Now woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama let me be

Don't come knocking 'round my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, I said, get away
American woman, listen what I say

Don't come hanging 'round my door
Don't want to see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes

Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

I gotta go, I gotta get away
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away

I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman

A-bye, bye, a-bye, bye
Bye bye, bye bye

(American woman)
You're no good for me and I'm no good for you
(American woman)
I look you right straight in the eye an' tell you what I'm gonna do

(American woman)
I'm gonna leave you woman, you know I gotta go
(American woman)
I'm gonna leave you woman, I gotta go

(American woman)
I gotta go, I gotta go American woman, yeah
