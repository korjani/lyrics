Baby, tell me that my love ain't good
I don't treat you right, I don't do it like I should

You try to tell me that my heart ain't true
How would I waste my time doin' all I do for you?

You ask me baby, why you hesitate
That you just can't wait but it takes the time it takes

Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round over you

You think I dissed you, so you packed your bags
You just kicked me 'round, you just through me out like trash

Now baby, babe, I'm on my knees for you
Well I might be late but what you're gonna do?

Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round over you

Baby, baby, gimme half a chance, I could treat you right
I'll give you good times and romance
'Cause baby, baby, I'm in love with you, you're my superstar
Tu es mon petit chouchou, yeah

Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round over you
