I got a problem seems I could use your advice
Of all the things I need the most and went and got myself a brand new vice
The first time that I did it I did it till the mornin' sun came
And now those little white lines, little white lines gonna sizzle up my brain
I woke up this mornin' didn't recognize my own face
I was lookin' thin and pale, boys, with little lines all over the place
Sometimes I wake up with my woman sometimes another man's girl
And all those little white lines, little white lines gonna set fire to my whole world

[Chorus]
Little white lines on the highway
Ill pick you up if you're goin' my way and you wanna roll
All those little white lines pullin' me down the highway
Its a dusty, bumpy road if you're goin my way

Got myself in a little mess got busted down around Abilene
I was goin' way to fast boys feelin' lonesome, on'ry and mean
That judge said: Shave your face boy I'm kickin' you down the line
Now those little white lines, little white lines got me doin 20 years of hard time

Oh no! Take me back to the way it was now boy!

[Shooter talks]

[Chorus]
Little white lines on the highway
Ill pick you up if you're goin' my way and you wanna roll
All those little white lines pullin' me down the highway
Its a dusty, bumpy road if you're goin my way

Yes Sir
Oh yes Sir
Yes Sir
No I haven't been drinking tonight
Oh my wife's license I think I left them in my other pants
These pills are for my back... I have a bad back.
You want me to what? I ain't getting out of this car
You want me to take what? What if I refuse
Ah Man you want me to shave my what?
Oh Hell not this again
Hey man these cuffs are a little too tight.
BUSTED AGAIN?
