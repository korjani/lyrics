Don't I belong to you
I hold you down right
Don't tell me that I ain't
Cus' that don't sound right
Want you to trust me til' it's all good
And that's for me to earn
But in time you'll see
And you will learn

I know my love is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know my sex is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know your body's like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know it all feel like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again

I wanna know, who turn you on
Who put it down right
Who better than me to be all over your body
Say it's mine
Tell me I'm the owner
We're lost in time because I ain't never over
How you gon' take that from us
If we grown, grown, we are grown yeah
And it won't inside my mind so get it
You're the only one I want, yeah

I know my love is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know my sex is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know your body's like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know it all feel like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again

Say you see as a Bugatti
Ride me like a Ducati
You got it, and plus you 'bout it
Wetter than a tsunmi, yeah
Gon' bend it over, twerk one time
Gon' bend it over, twerk two time
I just really love the little things you do
Forget them other girls it's just me and you
I said that I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' see it through
I got the vision and I'm hoping you can see it too

I know my love is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know my sex is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know your body's like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know it all feel like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again, oh yeah
