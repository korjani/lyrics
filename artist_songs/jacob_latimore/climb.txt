You're fantasizin', mesmerizin',
When you send me pictures, I get so excited, 
And oh,
I can't hold back, no,
It's just your eyes and, when we vibin',
Can't remember the last time that we were fightin', and oh
I'm gonna have a heart attack,
'Cause, girl, you bad, girl, you bad

I like the feeling when you know you feeling sexy,
In the bedroom, girl, I know you can impress me,
And when we lay down, lay down,
And I start from this bottom,

And I can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better,
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and don't stop now, no never

Oh, it's just us, ain't in no rush,
Wrap your legs around my waist under the covers,
Let's make love till the sun comes up, yeah,
Girl, when you move, all I wanna do is turn you around,
I wanna be behind you, our love nobody can touch
They ain't got nothing on us,

I like the feeling when you know you feeling sexy,
In the bedroom, girl, I know you can impress me,
And when we lay down, lay down,
And I start from this bottom,

And I can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better,
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and don't stop now, no never,

I want it all, I need all your fantasies,
Please don't be shy right now, it's just you and me,
Anticipating all your wants and your needs,
I aim to please,
I been waitin' all day to climb, so I'm gonna take my time, yeah,
Baby, this might take all night,
Are you ready?

And I can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better,
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb,
You give the best love ever, and don't stop now, no never
