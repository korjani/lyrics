Hello, this is me
Yeah, I'm your bee charmer, Lady Tee
But you can call me by my southern name, it's Honey

Too hip, got to go
Seems I got your honey call
Going to let the love flow
Nice and slow, let it go
Baby from the get-go
You'll be hitting oh

To and fro indigo
Up all night like no doze
Going to blow the solo
Sweet and low sexy flow
Taste like amaretto
Cause that's the way I roll

(Got cha honey call)
Got a honey call
(I'm coming at you with the quickness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give you all my sweetness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give it to you, baby)
Got a honey call
(Because your loving makes me crazy)

Super fly, honey pie
You don't have to be shy
Going to make you sigh sigh
Amplifier real high
Hotter than July
You'll be saying "my my"

Standing by, give the eye
Get a little comply
Maybe be your ally
Pass you by
Don't you cry
For you I would die die
On this you can rely

(Got cha honey call)
Got a honey call
(I'm coming at you with the quickness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give you all my sweetness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give it to you, baby)
Give it to you, baby, yeah
(Because your loving makes me crazy)

(Hit me on cellular phone)
(You can buzz me in my honey comb)
Honey comb
(It's sweet and sticky right down to the bone)
To the bone
(It's on and cracking do you feel me?)
(Cause it's happening, now!)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm your sweet sticky thing
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Busy little bee
I'm going to give it...
I'm going to give it to you
(Ain't nothing sweeter than my stuff, baby)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
You like my honey very sweet

Super fine
? wine
When you give the high sign
Tasting like a fine wine
Turpentine down my spine
Clinging like a grapevine
When we do the slow grind
?
You'd be mine
Flowing like my lifeline
Make me feel like moonshine
I'll recline
We confine[? ]
I'm trying not to get mine
I'm going to take my time

(Got cha honey call)
Got a honey call
(I'm coming at you with the quickness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give you all my sweetness)
All of my sweetness
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give it to you, baby)
Give it to, baby
(Because your loving makes me crazy)

Won't you come over
(I'm coming over)
When would you like me
(I'm coming right now)
Sooner than later
(Cause it's happening, now!)

(You can hit me on my cellular phone)
Hit me
(You cam buzz me in my honey comb)
Buzz Me
(It's sweet and sticky right down to the bone)
To the bone
(It's on a cracking do you feel me)
(Cause it's happening, now!)

(You can hit me on my cellular phone)
Hit me
(You cam buzz me in my honey comb)
Honey comb
(It's sweet and sticky right down to the bone)
To the bone
(It's on a cracking do you feel me)
Ooh ooh ooh
(Cause it's happening, now!)

Sticky sweet like orange glow
I like it in the bed
Y'all would want to take my package
Handle it with care
It's crackalacking, baby, here in my honey comb
I guess you woke up on the right side of the bed this morn
I'm going to give it to you
I'm going to do you right
I'm going to buzz you, Honey, this time each ad every night
I'll keep on buzzing ya
I'll keep on buzzing ya
I'll keep on buzzing ya
Buzzing ya
[Repeat]
