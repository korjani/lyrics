Looking out my window today
Seeing nothing but your sweet face
I wonder what this feeling can be
What's come over me

Can it be love

Lying in your arms I have felt
A space in time that makes my heart melt
I wonder what this feeling can be
What's this ecstasy

Can it be love
Can it be love
Can it be love
Can it be your love

I feel new fire in the glow of your eyes
Feeling for the first time your lips as sweet as wine
The thought of you caressing me knocks me to my knees
You swept me off my feet, you made my life complete

Can it be love
Can it be love
Can it be love
Can it be your love

(Can it be love)

Memories and distant refrain
Visions of the love we just made
I wonder if this heart of mine will do
What you want it too

Will it be love
Can it be love
Can it be love
Can it be love

I feel the fire in your eyes
Tastin' for the first time your lips as sweet as cherry wine
You caressing me knocks me to my knees
You keep me safe, you keep me warm
I'm feeling like a quiet storm

Can it be love, baby, yeah
Can it be love
Can it be your love
You make my heart fly sky high
I just wanna testify
Baby, what your love has to for me
What your love has done

I feel the fire, I feel the power
I feel the fire, the power, the fire
Can it be love, ooh
Can it be your love, ooh...

Can it be love, ooh
Can it be your love

I feel the fire, I feel the power
I feel the fire, the power, the fire, ooh...
