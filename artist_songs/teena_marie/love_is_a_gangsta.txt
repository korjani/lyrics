Love brought you in this world, baby
Love is gonna take you out,
Can't you see?
Love will make you stay out all night long,
Away from me,
Love will make you say the sweetest things,
Now you're talking crazy (gangsta)

Love is a pocket watch, solid gold,
Always runs a little late,
Kinda cold,
Love will have you stranded on the corner,
In the rain,
That's what happens when the hunter's captured
By the game (gangsta)

Love is a gangsta,
Love is the ultimate Don, it's a gangsta,
It's the black and white keys on a piano,
And an O-G singing soul,
Love is a gangsta,
Love is the Valentine's Massacre Gangsta,
Have you actin' kinda shady, making lots of babies,
Playing with the ladies' heads, oh

Love is a Marvin Gaye, hear the call,
Baby you sure love to play, "Love to ball"
Love is gonna soothe the savage beast,
Hear me now,
Before I put you right back on your leash,
'Cause you been foul,
Love is a natural,
Nice and round,
Foxy just like Ms. Pam Grier,
Pretty and brown,
Love will have you sexing all night long,
'Cause you're the man,
Now you're laying up in the cut,
With the upper hand (Gangsta)

Love is a gangsta,
Love is a pintstripe suit-wearing gangsta,
A machine gun in a violin case,
Take you here and take you there,
Love is a gangsta,
A bootleg liquored up gangsta,
Gets no better than this, has an iron-clad fist,
It's a diamond tiara, a gangsta

Love'll make you come home early, (early),
Make you stay out all night long, (all night long, gangsta),
Love'll make you do some things, (some things),
Baby that you know is wrong, (know is wrong, gangsta),
Love'll have you stranded out on Crenshaw, (Crenshaw),
Crying the blues there in the rain, (in the rain, gangsta),
Make you forget who you are, where you going,
Where you came from baby,
Now you're feeling so much pain (so much pain, gangsta),
Love'll have you crawling 'round your carpet (crawling),
Searching for your rock cocaine (cocaine, gangsta),
Make you forget to count your blessings (blessings),
Knowing God's love will sustain (sustain), ooh,

Love is a gangsta,
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta,
Machine gun in a violin case,
Take you here and take you there,
Love is a gangsta,
A bootleg liquored up gangsta,
Have you actin kinda shady, making lot's of babies,
Playing with the ladies' heads

Be careful 'bout the company that you keep,
Or you might just end up loosing sleep,
Paying the price that most of us will find too steep,
And in the end you're right back on the street,

Love is an O-G gangsta,
A diamond tiara, a gangsta,
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta,
A platinum chain, it's a gangsta,
Love is an O-G gangsta,
A diamond tiara, a gangsta
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta,
A platinum chain, it's a gangsta...
