You will always be my King
And I will always be your Lady Tee... .

Touch me in the morning,
Baby, I don't mind,
You can make it all better,
It's fine.

Everywhere I go,
In every face I see,
Honey it reminds me,
Of you and me,
And if you think,
I'm gonna love you baby,
Then come on and hear me when I say... .

You blow me away,
Just like a summer breeze baby,
You blow me away,
Just like a warm wind,
You blow me away,
And I love you, sugar,
Baby you know I do, swear I do
Beautiful dreamer.

Helpless like a little baby,
Feeling soft and shy,
I won't let this golden chance,
Pass me by,
You can have me baby,
You can have all of me,
From my head down to my toes sugar,
And all that's in between,
And if you think I'm gonna be here, baby,
Then come on and hear me when I say...

You blow me away,
Just like a summer breeze,
Baby you blow me away,
Just like a warm wind,
You blow me away,
And I love you, sugar,
Baby you know I do, I swear I do,
Beautiful dreamer do you hear me calling you?

Please, please baby,
I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'm hopeless romtantic just for you,
I have no precious time to spend,
Until you require,
Just let me tend to your every desire,
Baby come on feel the fire,
(Can you feel the fire, can you feel the fire and desire, can you feel the fire, sugar all night long?),
Sugar all night long, yes,
There's nothing I won't do to please you baby,
(Nothing for you, nothing for you that I wouldn't do),
I wanna be close to you, I wanna get next to you,
And if you think I'm gonna be here baby,
Then come on and hear me when I say... .

You blow me away,
(There ain't nothing like the real thing baby),
Morning, noon and night-time baby
You blow me away just like a warm wind,
I'm talking 'bout the real thing sugar,
Yes, I love you that's forever, gon always be together,
You and I... .

No one else can ever love me like you do,
No one else can ever touch my heart like you.

(I love you Rick)
There I've gone and said it,
(And I know you love me),
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you baby.
