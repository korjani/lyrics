So you say you're leaving for the Southern tip of Spain
To soak up local color and forget my name
To live inside the major, not the minor chord
And forget how we made love in a '57 Ford

Lips to find you, lips to find you (Baby, I've got)
Lips to find you (And there's nowhere you can run, baby)
Lips to find you, lips to find you (There's nowhere to hide)
Lips to find you

Crystal blue persuasion in your dreams the spice
Will find you chilly killy in your bed at night
In the most remote of places you can't hide
'Cause once is not enough when you've been satisfied

Lips to find you, lips to find you (Baby, I've got)
Lips to find you (And there's nowhere you can run, baby)
Lips to find you, lips to find you (There's nowhere to hide)
Lips to find you (From the power of my tenderness)

There's nowhere to run
And there's no where you can hide from me
There's nowhere to hide
From the power of my tender
I've got lips to find your love

I'm talking to you, boy
What are you gonna do, boy
Hear me talking to you, boy
What are you gonna do, baby
What are you gonna do, oh, babe
What are you gonna do

So you say you're leaving for the Southern tip of Spain
To soak up local color and forget my name
To live inside the major, not the minor chord
And forget how we made love in a '57 Ford

But I've got lips, lips to find you
I've got lips, lips to find you

What are you gonna do when there's nowhere to run
When there's no where you can hide from me
When there's nowhere to hide
From the power of my tender
I've got lips to find your love

I'm talking to you, boy
What are you gonna do, boy
Hear me talking to you, boy
What are you gonna do
When you call my name from the South of Spain
What are you gonna do
When you miss my lips and you start to trip
What are you gonna do
When I get to you with my crystal blue
What are you gonna do
When you miss me, baby, and you're going crazy

What are you gonna do, baby, do, baby, do, baby, do, baby
What are you gonna do for me, do for me, do for me, do for me
What are you gonna do, baby, do, baby, do, baby, do, baby
What are you gonna do for me, do for me, do for me, do for me

I've got lips, lips to find you
I've got lips, lips to find you
I've got lips, lips to find you
I've got lips, lips to find you
