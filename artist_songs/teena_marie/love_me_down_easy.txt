Love me down easy and then say good-bye
Love me down easy and I'll try not to cry
Even if it means I have to wait until my next life
I don't care it's just something to do
Like the petals of five dozen roses with white chocolate
And champagne in bed that's how I think of you

'Cause you're sweeter than the taste of a cherry so rare
When you love me-love me-love me down easy

Love me down easy and then savor each kiss
Love me down easy for it's you that I miss
Even if it means I have to wait beside my telephone
When all the while I know it might not ring
Call it foolish I think not-for false pride is a sin and baby
You know that you've been my everything

'Cause you're sweeter than the taste of a cherry so rare
When you love-love me-love me down easy

I think it's time for you to call my name
Don't say a word darling
There's no need to explain
'Cause you're sweeter than the taste
Of a cherry so rare
And no matter where you are just call my name
Say the words darling and I'll be there

You turn my head around
Ooo when you love me down easy baby easy lover
Baby baby baby love-easy-easy
