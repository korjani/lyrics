After I left you
I found I can't be so far
And so long away
And here I am, huh
Getting ready to get on this train
And I don't have anybody to talk to
But myself
You can't even hear me
And my words cannot convey my feeling

Manchester, England looks a lot like me today
Ain't no sunshine in the feelin'
I thought about you as I got aboard the train
Ain't no truth in the believing

It's the natural thing to think of you
After all we've been through
Do you ever think of me at night
Wondering why I left your world undone

Where's California {Far from Liverpool}
So very far from you {Far from lovin' you}
Ooh, baby, did I warn ya {Baby, did I warn ya}
I'd take your love to Liverpool {Where's California}
Don't it make you wonder

I called your mama and I asked her what to bring
She said London fog would be the thing
I couldn't find the fog, the Beatles, or myself
This pain in my heart is above all I have felt

But it's the natural thing to think of you
After all we've been through
Do you ever think of me at night
Wondering why I left your world undone

Where's California {Far from Liverpool}
So very far from you {Far from lovin' you}
Ooh, baby, did I warn ya {Baby, did I warn ya}
I'd take your love to Liverpool {Where's California}
Don't it make you wonder

Don't it make you wonder why
Don't it make you wanna break down and cry
Don't it make you wonder why
Don't it make you wonder
Over and over and over again
Finding it hard to pretend

Where's California {Far from Liverpool}
So very far, so very far from you {Far from lovin' you}
Ooh, baby, did I warn ya {Baby, did I warn ya}
I'd take your love to Liverpool {Where's California}

And where's {Where's California} California {Far from Liverpool}
So very, so very far, so very far from you
Ooh... ooh... woo... ooh... ooh... {Far from you}

Oh, where's {Where's California} are you {Far from Liverpool}
Far away
