Romantica,
I'll always be so hopelessly romantic,
Just like the wind baby, the earth, the sky,
And you and I made magic... .

What about me, baby?
Will I live my life alone?
No one to comfort me,
Must I sing for everyone?
Was that a kiss I felt,
Soft on my cheek just then?
Did you awaken me?
And where did it all begin?
How can I time travel?
Must I encapsulate?
All that we ever were,
The sand, the sea, the shore and fate?
I'm riding in your rocket,
You crash me back to earth,
I cried when Steveland sang,
"And do you have angel wings? "

Romantica,
Just like Heaven works of wonders,
Two passing ships in the night,
Two restless lovers,
Romantica,
To the stars you must surrender,
So take your place as you return to forever,
Return to forever, my love... .my love.

What about you? Are you,
Sleeping with the angels now?
And are you making music?
Did you take a sacred vow,
To be an altar boy?
And do you ring the bells?
I hear you're with your mother,
Yes and she too is well,
I have my memories,
As I lay here in my bed,
Oh how we danced those nights,
On those days when we were wed,
I'm happy for you now,
So happy that you're free,
Ours was an epic tale,
Sung through eternity.

Romantica,
Just like Heaven works of wonders,
Two passing ships in the night,
Two star-crossed lovers,
Romantica,
Now your soul you must surrender,
So take your place,
As you return to forever,
Return to forever my love... . my love.

They say I'll see you again but I know,
That's intangible,
Why must I keep wanting things that I know,
Are not haveable?

Why is the earth so still?
Is it that surreal?
Has your cup been filled?
Will I grow old gracefully?

Romantica,
I'll always be so hopelessly romantic,
Just like the wind, the earth, the sky,
And you and I were magic... .

Romantica,
I'll always be so hoplessly romantic,
Just like the wind, baby, the earth, the sky,
And you and I made magic.
