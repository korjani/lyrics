Yeah, Everybody got one huh
And you're mine

Baby I'm your fiend [x3]
I've been craving
For your love I've been saving
I've been paving the low road to you
Baby I'm your fiend [x3]
You got me open wide

Under my skin
Honey I can't fade you
Might as well just
Resign myself to this

I can't shake it
Got a love hang over
And it haunts me, mm
Cause it's deep in my veins

Baby I'm your fiend [x3]
(I've been craving you)
I've been craving
And I ain't misbehaving
I've been paving the low road to you
Baby I'm your fiend [x3]
(Got me open wide)
You got me open wide

Kind of woozy, mm
How's about a real shot?
Maybe Bourbon, yeah
It's right there in my bag

I done lost it, mm
I don't have to tell you
Consequently my stripes like Billie's yellow

Making love to Cole, swinging, you know?
Are you staying?
Are you just in town awhile?
That's pretty good
Yeah you know
I'm digging you for days
Hey!
I'm your fiend
Yeah you know what I mean

Baby I'm your fiend [x3]
You got me open wide

Kind of woozy
How's about a real shot
Maybe Bourbon
It's right there in my bag
I done lost it
I don't have to tell you
Consequently your stripes like Billie's yellow
Making love to Cole, swinging, you know?
Are you staying?
Are you just in town a while
That's pretty good
I'm feeling you
I'm digging you for day!
AWWWWW EZ!
I'm your fiend
Do you know what I mean?

I'm dizzy on the dance floor
Do I dig you for sure?
I need a little bit more
To help me in this cold world [x3]
