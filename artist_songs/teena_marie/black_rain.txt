What Michelle say?
Do you love her as much as you love me?

I sit alone
I watch the phone get dial toned
Then you I've known
The marrow bone
A rolling stone

My body's well
On cigarettes and coffee grounds
Tears of a clown
Love had me downs
Reverbs and nouns

Because I can't stand the rain
Falling on the inside
Of my window pane
It gets so cold inside
So if you leave
Please make haste
Cause it's starting on the inside
And it just might be too late

Make no mistakes
You gonna drown and now it's on [? ]
To hear my rhyme
Sad as it goes
Five seven slow [? ]
I loved you so
Uh

The beautiful ones always smash the picture
Hooooo
No subtle hints
No words I missed
I quote a former Prince

Because I can't stand the rain
Falling on the inside
Of my window pane
It gets so cold inside
So if you leave
Please make haste
Cause it's starting on the inside
And it just might be too late

It's a thin line between love and hate baby
Here in my heart
Where pain is swift
And lyrics start
You took the best that I gave
As though I was your slave
Say it's not fair
It's willing tell her that you care
No time to delay
To be on your way

Black Rain
Black Rain
Black Rain
Black Rain!

Sweet black rain
I've been ordained
Taken from me again
Only plain rain remains

My heart is stained
Baptized by flame
You gave me pain
Sweet black rain
Only plain rain remains

Lord I love Black Rain
Black Rain
Black Rain
Black Rain, uh

Black Rain
Black Rain
I've been ordained
Black Rain

My sweet Black Rain
I wanna go outside
In Black Rain

I sit alone
I watch the phone get dial toned
Then you I've known
A rolling stone
The marrow bone

My body's well
On cigarettes and coffee ground
Tears of a clown
Reverbs and nouns
Love had me down
Sweet Black Rain
