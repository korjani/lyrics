Love is just a one-way street
If I'm lost without you
Love is not a two-way street
If I can't be glad I've found you
Love can't hold me tight on a sleepless night
On the strength of who you are
Love can't compensate for the fool I've been
To let it go this far
Love is when you put me back together
When I can't pick up the pieces
Love is the fix it man who'll do the best he can

Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Would you do that to me, boy)
Fix it, baby (Oh, I need your lovin')
Fix it, baby (Hi... yi...)

Just another face I left unnoticed in the crowd
To get my attention a Siddartha bow
I can think and I can fast and I can wait
Baby, don't you hesitate

{I'll make your third eye feel good}
{I'm your fix it man}

Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Do it for me, boy)
Fix it, baby (Oh, I need your lovin')
Fix it, baby (Hi... yi...)

Said got your first eye into guys that feel the physical
What about your spirit, baby, is it cool
No, I didn't think so, ask me how I know
No light in your eyes aglow

{For whatever ails you}
{I'm your fix it man}

Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Would you do that for me, child)
Fix it, baby (Oh, I need your lovin')
Fix it, baby (Ho... oh...)

Just like Humpty Dumpty off the wall
I'm falling down
I am just the pieces of a fall
Don't you wanna fix it
Baby, won't you put me back together again
I'm in dire need of a fix it man

Fix it man
Put me back together again
Fix it man
Put me back together again

Fix it, fix it, fix it
Love motion in my mind
{Take two aspirins and call me in the morning}
Doctor feel so good

Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Do it for me, boy)
Fix it, baby (Ooh, I need your lovin')
Fix it, baby (Ho... oh...)

Fix it, baby (Won't you fix it, baby)
Fix it, baby (Oh, I need your lovin')
Fix it, baby (I know you can)
Fix it, baby (Be my fix it man)

Baby, on the serious side
My vibration it needs a little spirit
{I can think, I can fast, I can wait}
{Baby, let me blow your mind}

Let me blow your mind, let me blow your mind
Let me blow your mind (Blow my mind, baby)
Let me blow your mind, let me blow your mind
Let me blow your mind (Ooh... ooh... and you're blowing my mind)

Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)
Fix it, baby (Baby, won't you)

Baby, baby, baby
Fix it

Blow my mind, baby
