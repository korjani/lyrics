Standing on the corner of rhythm and blues
A Valentino smile gave me my first clue
Tell me girl, I wonder can you spare me some time
He said, I mean more than just your nine to five

Love at first sight I thought so
Or maybe it was the clock
That led me to his passion
It was not "pillow talk"

When he taught me to spell disaster
I hollered someone save me

There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery
There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

He was Poitier and Gable all rolled into one man
A Marlon Brando voice, played me to his hand
Sweet words not just saccharin
But the pure sugarcane
Confection surely drips
When he speaks my name

Love at first sight I thought so
Or maybe it was the clock
That led me to his passion
It was not "pillow talk"

When he taught me to spell disaster
I hollered someone save me

There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery
There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me
