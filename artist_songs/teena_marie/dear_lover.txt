Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

If I could paint a picture
Of the love I have inside
It would paint all of you and all of me
Without no thought of pride

Then maybe you would know
Exactly all the things I feel
Not just a maybe
But baby, I'm for real

'Cause I've been wishin' on the stars and hopin'
Just as it shoots across the sky
Searchin' for the so-called answers
That we're supposed to find in time

Holding you close
Not letting go
Baby, I've got to let you know

Dear lover
I hope this letter finds you
Dear lover
And that it comes in time to say no, "C'est la vie"
Baby, dear lover

(Listen to me)

If I could write your name out
Forever in the Hall of Fame
It would be history, no mystery
Not at all in vain

I'd quote a poet on a verse
That read when I was small
And write your name out
Across the sky in letter ten feet tall

'Cause I've been wishing on the rings of Saturn
Calling on Jupiter and Mars
Praying on ten zillion light years
To bring you closer to my heart

Holding you close
Not letting go
Baby, I've got to let you know

Dear lover
I hope this letter finds you
Dear lover
And that it comes in time to say no, "C'est la vie"
Baby, listen to me, darlin'
Baby, every word that I say
Baby, I'll give you my love, ooh... ooh...

Baby, if you say you love me
I'll be right by your side
Dare anyone to try to take you from me all my life

Straight from my heart
Dear lover
Straight from my heart
Dear lover

Straight from my heart
Dear lover
Ooh... hoo... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Dear lover
Dear lover
Straight, straight, straight from my heart
Dear lover
