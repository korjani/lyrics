Every time you come around
I feel my world starts turning topsy-turvy
And I just can't fight the spin
Baby, won't you listen to this love
Whose hearts been missing and don't hurt me
'Cause I'm falling your way again

Am I weak
Well, sometimes I just can't hardly speak
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you've got me signing

Ooo la-la-la
It's the way that you feel when you know it's real
Ooo la-la-la
It's the warm that's inside when you're satisfied

Ooo la-la-la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooo la-la-la
Let's stay together, oh

I can see it there
That look upon your face is saying love's in making
Boy, I know what's on your mind
Love is for the lasting
And it's your just for the asking for the taking
'Cause I'm falling your way this time

Do I thrill
Well, sometimes I get subliminal chills
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you got me singing

Ooo la-la-la
It's the take to the sky on a natural high
Ooo la-la-la
It's the heaven that's sent when your heart's content

Ooo la-la-la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooo la-la-la
Let's stay together

Ooo la-la-la, don't ever go
'Cause I love you do, I love you so, baby
Ooo la-la-la, don't ever go
'Cause I'll surely die if you ever say goodbye, my baby

You got me falling
Falling for you, falling with you
Falling to you, falling after you
Falling

Ooh, sweet thing, you got me singing
Ooo la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing, whoa, you got me singing
Ooo la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing, whoa, you got me singing
Ooo la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing, oh, you got me singing
Ooo la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing, oh, you got me singing

Ooo la-la-la
It's the way that you feel when you know it's real
Ooo la-la-la
It's the warm that's inside when you're satisfied

Ooo la-la-la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooo la-la-la
Let's stay together

Ooh... ooh...
Sweet, ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh...
Sweet thing, ooh...

You know everybody
Sometimes you should just stop
And take some time out to tell the one you love
Just how much they mean to you
Because you see, sometimes the needs of the one
Outweigh the needs of the many
And if you understand what I'm talkin' about

Let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Oh, I'm givin' up to you

I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)
I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)
I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)
I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)

I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)
I said I'm falling (Ooo la-la-la)
(Ooo la-la-la)
