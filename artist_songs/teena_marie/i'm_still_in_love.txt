Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh yeah [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Tell me baby how long has it been
Here you come and here I go again
I must admit you lookin rather fly
Your a sight for sore eyes (sight for sore eyes)
Situation wasn't quite that cool
Seven years ago we both were fools
But I'm real enough to let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

[Chorus:]
I'm lovin you, I'm still lovin you baby
I'm still in love
Nobodys gonna take yo place in my life
I'm still in love
I'm lovin you, I'm still lovin you honey
I'm feelin you, what you feelin too now

[Verse 2:]
What's that look upon your face my dear
Must be magic in the atmosphere
I'm a gonna leave it up to chemistry
Stir it up sugar free (stir it up, stir it up)
Sexy, jumpin, blazin everywhere
My cribs closer honey let's go there
You gotta sister fiening baby please
I'm a bout to be your main squeeze

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ah c'mon baby let me stir it up
I'll remix it in my lovin cup
Things are gettin heated let's go chill
I'm a bout to be in yo grill
Sexy, jumpin, blazin nows the time
My cribs closer on the west side now
You gotta sister fiening baby please
I'm a bout to be your main squeeze

Gonna stir it, gonna stir it, gonna stir on up
I'm a stir it on up
Gonna mix it, gonna mix it, gonna mix it in my lovin cup
Gonna stir it, gonna stir it gonna stir it on up
Stir it on up, stir it on up
Gonna mix it, gonna mix it, gonna mix it in my lovin cup
In my lovin cup

All the ladies to my left if you feel what I'm feelin,
Holla let me hear ya scream
All my sister to my right if you've been there before,
Come and stir it up with me [x2]

Gonna stir it

Mix it in my lovin cup
I'm gonna mix it [x4]
