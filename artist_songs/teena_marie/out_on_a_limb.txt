Tender was the kiss when you held me captive in your sweet embrace
My lips begin to burn and my heart beats faster then the normal pace
I try hard to resist that familiar smile that melts me just like wax
But what's the use, I'm yours and that means forever, there's no turning back

Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery
Ooh, you got me spinning around, what have you done to me
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never felt so sure, what am I gonna do

I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I... I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again

Sweeter than the taste of a midnight rendezvous, so sensual
The look upon your face when you loved me tender and my cup was full
Oh... softer than the sigh when it all was over and I slumbered deep
Lost inside of you like there's no tomorrow as I fall to sleep

Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery
Ooh, you got me spinning around, what have you done to me
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never felt so sure, what am I gonna do

I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I... I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again

Hold me
Keep me warm inside you and love me
Love me right away
This one thing is true
I would die for you

Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... oh... baby

I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in to you again

Baby, I'm
Baby, I'm

Baby, I'm out on a limb for you
I'm giving in to you
I'm out on a limb
Baby, I'm giving in to you again

Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Baby, I'm out on a limb
I'm out on a limb
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb
I'm on a limb
I'm giving in to you again, babe
