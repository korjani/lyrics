It's not the way that you comb your hair to the left side, sugar
It's not the way that you keep the beat
On or off your feet
No mention when we get real close
How my body gets weak-And I'm about to smoke
Do-wa, do-wa, do-wa

All these things that I feel
If you'd only come real
At this moment in time
Right here, right now, you'd be mine

Work it, Work it Baby, Baby can you work
Can you work it like a 9 to 5, child
Work it, I'm talking overtime
Baby, can you work it
Can you work the night shift

It's not the way that you talk that stuff
To my left ear, honey
It's not the way that you take a chance
When you do your dance
No mention you be on the scene
And you drive my car
And you gangster lean, do-wa, do-wa, do-wa

All these things that I feel
If you only come real
At this moment in time
Right here, right now, you'd be mine

Work it, Work it Baby, Baby can you work
Can you work it love child
Work it, I'm talking overtime
Baby, can you work it, work it
Can you work the night shift, child

It's not the way that you're right by my side
Or the way that you smooth out the ride
It's not the way that you keep the beat
On or off your feet
It's not the way that you always come through
When you know what to do for my high
It's not the way you break the law
When you do-wa-wa

Work it, Can you work it love child
Work it, Can you work overtime, all right
Work it, Can you work it like a 9 to 5, child
Work it, baby can you work it
Work it, work it baby
