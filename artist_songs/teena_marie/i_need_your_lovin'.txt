Ohhhh!

[Verse 1:]
Love speaks fast
Coming on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talking pressures or material games

[Bridge:]
But M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I never understand what people says are in no
Ask me what I need

[Chorus:]
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time just will do

(Just a little lovin' just won't do)

Just a little love

(Just a little lovin' just won't do)

Na na na na

(Just a little lovin just won't do)

L-O-V-E love

(Just a little lovin me and you)

[Verse 2:]
Love's coming so glad you're mine
I don't want your rythym without you're ryhme no
Easy feeling 'cause your love keeps getting better

Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

But M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feeel it in my bones that you and I can win oh
Ask me what I need

[Chorus:]
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
And just a little time just won't do

(Just a little lovin just won't do)

Just a little love

(Just a little lovin' just won't do)

La na na na la la

(Just a little lovin' just won't do)

La na na na na na na

(Just a little lovin just won't do)

'Cause M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my curl our love will never end oh
Ask me what I need

[Chorus:]
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
Yeah!
I need your lovin'
In just a little time just won't do
Baby me and you yeah
I just need your lovin'

(Just a little lovin' just won't do)
(Just a little lovin me and you)
