Baby I'm not gonna let you slip through my fingers
This time I'm not gonna make the same mistake
'Cause you're the one for me, my destiny
And if you thought I never
Saw you, well I saw you when you walked into the room...

My head started spinnin', this must be a sin and
I think I'm going crazy
Then you called me sweetness, sweetness is my weakness
Automatic baby

Sending out an APB (Must be a crime)
'Cause my baby put a thing on me (I'm about to drop the dime)

Open your eyes, come a little closer to me
Must be, love twins, life's too short to waste this
Precious, ever loving moment and I can't hide it sugar
Tears of a clown on my face right now
Baby come and save me

Dancing cheek to cheek and a little bit of freakin'
Oh, you're blowing my mind
The closest thing to Heaven, let's do it all again and
Let's go slower this time

Sending out an APB (They really should arrest you)
'Cause my baby put a thing on me ('Cause nobody can contest you)

Baby, baby, baby come and save me

My head started spinnin', this must be a sin and
I think I'm going crazy
Then you called me sweetness, sweetness is my weakness
Automatic baby

Sending out an APB (Must be a crime)
'Cause my baby put a thing on me (I'm about to drop the dime)

Sending out an APB (They really should arrest you)
'Cause my baby put a thing on me

I don't think you heard me baby
I don't think you understand baby
I don't think you have any idea what you done to me baby

I still remember the night (yes) my brother introduced you to me baby
You walked into the room, all the ladies swooned
It was all about you baby

Somebody call the cops, I need the handcuffs baby,
Save me, hey
Must be a crime, I'm about to drop the dime
They really should arrest you sugar, yeah
