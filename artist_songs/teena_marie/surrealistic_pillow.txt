There's a message in my madness, Coming out to you
The only one who ever knew me
There's a maybe in my head baby, You'll be coming too
Pink clouds all in my eyes, purple mountains capsize
When I'm thinking about you
So it's not gibberish when it's you that I miss
And there's one bell that rings true
You know who you are, you know what you've been
You know that your feathers tickle-hurt my skin
You know I'm the brown sugar covered with snow
And magnetisms animal you know

Surrealistic Pillow soft and cushion and just right
Surrealistic Pillow, I guess, I held your love too tight

There's a method to my magic, coming out to you
The only one who ever knew me
If you hear me pillow-talking, you'll be comin to
Moonbeans all in my hand, sweet dreams that you began
When I'm thinkin about you
So it's not by design, when it's you on my mind
And there's no one bell that rings true
You know who you are, you know what you've been
You know that your feathrs tickle-hurt my skin
You know I'm the brown sugar covered with snow And magnetisms animal you know
Ijust want hold you tight
Make love to you all night
D it till we get it right
Lay you head down
