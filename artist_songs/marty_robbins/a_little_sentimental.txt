Sitting here with you don't know why I'm blue
Just a feeling that I've had right from the start
Something bout your smile that lingers for a while
Stirs an old time mem'ry in my heart.

Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
Don't mind me I'm not about to cry
It's just a thought that I remember
Left over from a time in days gone by.

Don't mind me if I'm a little melancholy
Thinking of someone that I love so
Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
You remind me of the girl I used to know.

Don't mind me if I'm a little melancholy
Thinking of someone that I love so
Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
You remind me of the girl I used to know...
