When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad.

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call.

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout.

Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name.

So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground.

I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow.

My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give.

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground.

A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name...
