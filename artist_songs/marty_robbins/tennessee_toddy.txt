Well, me and my baby was a-walkin' down the road
Just a-hoppin' along like two little toads
I looked down at her; I said, 'What can we do?'
She said, 'Let's go someplace where we can hop to the blues!'

I said, 'I don't know a place where we can do such a thing.'
She said, 'I know a place, and, man, it's just a dream!
It's just a little spot on the outside of town
Where we can really pick 'em up and put 'em down!'

So we went to a place called Everybody's
There I met a little chick called the Tennessee Toddy
The reason she was called the Tennessee Toddy 
Was that she was all legs with a little bitty body,
But that cat could go, yeah, she was gone, gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you all about it in the very next verse of my song.

She was long and lean like a green string bean:
Calm and collected and cool and keen!
She was all of this and a whole lot more;
When my baby saw me watching her, she threw me out the door
And we were gone, yeah, we were gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you more about it in the very next verse of my song.

I took my baby home and she said, 'Good night.'
She said, 'Be real good and sleep real tight!'
I rushed right back to Everybody's
'Cause I had to get acquainted with the Tennessee Toddy!
So I left, yeah, I was gone, gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you more about it in the very next verse of my song.

I was back there jumpin' with Toddy at three
When in walked a gent twice as big as me
He looked real mean and mad and sore;
He made for me and I made for the door,
Just a-runnin', yeah, I was gone, gone, along gone,
And there ain't no more, so this is the end of my song...
