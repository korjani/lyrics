I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining 'round my door
Oh, how I wish I were there again
Down in the little green valley
That's where my homesick heart will trouble me no more.

There's only one thing ever gives me consolation
And that's the thought that I'll be going back someday
And ev'ry night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away.

I hear a mockingbird down in the little green valley
He's singing out a song of welcome just for me
And someone waits by the garden gate
Down in the little green valley
When I get back again, how happy she will be.

And by a little babbling brook, once more we'll wander
And in a shady nook, we'll dream the hours away
And I will leave all my cares behind
Go where I know I'll find sunshine
Back to that little old green valley far away.
