I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part. 
I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses, 
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you thought how to cry.
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you.
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart.
