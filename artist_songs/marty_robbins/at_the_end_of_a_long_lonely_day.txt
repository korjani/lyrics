At the end of a long lonely day without you,
When the world seems to fall in my face.
I'm all right through the day, but the day fades away,
And the long lonely night takes its place.

[Chorus 1]
Another day to wish that you were here,
I dread each lonely night that's filled with fear.
Oh, I've cried and I've cried these are tears that I can't hide,
At the end of a long lonely day.

At the end of the day, I go up to my room,
And I watch while the sun fades away.

And the lonliness there brings me grief and dispair,
At the end of a long lonely day.

[Chorus 2]
Another day to sit alone and cry,
It makes no difference if I live or die.
With a world locked outside I just lay there and cry,
At the end of a long lonely day.

[Repeat Chorus 1]
