Don't listen to gossip whatever you do
It's usually lies that you'll hear
What they say about me they say about you
So kiss me and dry up your tears

And don't you believe what they say about me
They're tryin' to keep us apart
The vows that were spoken weren't meant to be broken
Don't turn me away from your heart

It's cheap and it's worthless, so cold and so cruel
It's gossip that I'm speakin' of
So often it starts on the lips of a fool
And ends in the ashes of love

So don't you believe what they say about me
They're tryin' to keep us apart
The vows that were spoken weren't meant to be broken
Don't turn me away from your heart
