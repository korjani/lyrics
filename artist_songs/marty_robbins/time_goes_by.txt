Time goes by and I still love you
Place no one on earth above you
Time goes by and still I haven't changed
Time goes by and I still miss you
Wanna hold you close and kiss you
Time goes by and still I haven't changed

You told me to forget you
And find somebody new
But I don't want somebody else
I'm still in love with you
I love you and you should know it
What else must I do to show it
Time goes by and still I haven't changed

I love you, I do so madly
So completely and so gladly
Time goes by and still I haven't changed
Like a ship that needs a captain
I need you, that's all I'm askin'
Time goes by and still I haven't changed

So give me what I cry for
It's you I'm thinkin' of
I can't be any different
You see, I'm still in love
Say you care and really show it
Hold me close and make me know it
Time goes by and still I haven't changed
