I was a poor boy, a poor girl was she
I loved her true and I thought she loved me
But I couldn't offer her anything new
It's a pity what money can do

She met with a stranger more wealthy than I
What I had promised her he said he'd buy
She gave him kisses then left me so blue
It's a pity what money can do

A man without money is well off, it seems
He can't spend fortunes on poor worthless schemes
But a rich man will buy dreams that never come true
It's a pity what money can do

Now he has my sweetheart, I'm all alone
He'll be as lonesome when his fortune's gone
She'll spend all his silver then find someone new
It's a pity what money can do
