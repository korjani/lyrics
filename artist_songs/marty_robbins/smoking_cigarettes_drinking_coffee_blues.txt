I guess I'll take a walk tonight
I know that I can't sleep
And I won't go to bed at all
I'll just lay there and weep
Instead, I'll make our favorite spot
That's what I think I'll do
I got those smokin' cigarettes
And drinkin' coffee blues

Smokin' cigarettes
And drinkin' coffee all night long
Wondrin' how a love so right
Could suddenly go wrong
I bet there's a lot of people
Know the misery I go thru
I've got those smokin' cigarettes
And drinkin' coffee blues

Sittin' at a table
Where I carved my baby's name
Won'drin' how our love went wrong
Wonderin' who's to blame
Listenin' while the juke box
Plays a song that makes me blue
Another cup of coffee
Then a cigarette or two
