Return to me
Oh my dear I'm so lonely
Hurry back hurry back
Oh my love hurry back I'm yours
Return to me
For my heart wants you only
Hurry home hurry home
Won't you please hurry home to my heart

My darling if I hurt you I'm sorry
Forgive me and please say you are mine

Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart

Retorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Mio cuore
