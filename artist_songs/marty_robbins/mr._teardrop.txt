Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling
Can't you see you only give me away
Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling
Will it always, always be this way

I tell my friends I'm glad she's gone
I tell them little lies
And then you drop in on the scene
And they see through my disguise-ise
Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling
Go away so I can smile again

I tell my friends I'm glad she's gone
I tell them little lies
And then you drop in on the scene
And they see through my disguise-ise
Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling
Go away so I can smile again
