Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car.
It broke my heart
To see them drive away.
I lost the one I love today.

Dressed all in white satin,
White lace in her hair.
She looked so lovely
It was more than I could bear.
Some people guessed the way that I felt
They saw the tears I could not hide.

I should have stayed at home.
I knew what was in store,
But somethin' made me come
To see her just once more.
Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.
