No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up  smiling
I'll  miss you but no one will ever know

I'll tell them we grew tired of each  other
And realized our dreams could never  be
I'll  even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me

No one will ever know how much I'm pineing
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm  hiding
You've hurt me but no one will ever know

I'll tell then I found true love with another
That I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
