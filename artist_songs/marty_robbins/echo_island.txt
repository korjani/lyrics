Love is lost on Echo Island hearts are broken just like mine
Kisses lost on Echo Island whispered love words seem so kind

Tender moments gone forever gone is all the love we knew
On the Island there's an echo softly saying I love you

Tender moments gone forever gone is all the love we knew
On the Island there's an echo softly saying I love you
