I'm as sad as the willow
That weeps in the valley
Since you've gone,
Since you've gone from my arms

I'm as sad as the cold wind
That rythes in the treetops,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Come back, come back,
Come back to the valley,
Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

I will weep like the willow
That weeps in the valley,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Come back, come back,
Come back to the valley,
Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

I will weep like the willow
That weeps in the valley,
I'll be lonesome until you return
