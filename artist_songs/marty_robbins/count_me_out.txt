Taking me for granted was your first mistake
And that was the beginning of my last heartache.
And then you added insult to my injury
When you started treating me just as you please.

Count me out of future plans you might be making.
No more foolish chances am I taking.
You played love's game too rough.
As for me, I've had enough
'Cause the going's got too rough so count me out.

Things I thought important never bothered you.
And you kept on 'till you killed all my love for you.
Doing as you pleased became a part of you
And you can't blame me now for walking out on you.

Count me out of future plans you might be making.
No more foolish chances am I taking.
You played love's game too rough.
As for me, I've had enough
'Cause the going's got too rough so count me out...
