There'll be fireworks tonight
Everybody's on their knees
Admiration for the one
Riot in a dead-end street
Don't be afraid to hear his voice
Tells you lies you wanna hear

You just listen and obey
Got the ticket in your hand
A new religion for the mob
For everyone to understand
We're all just clockwork toys tonight
And salvation is drawing near

The snow covered opera tonight
Enchanted with dilated eyes

Living in a rat race
Dying in a rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in a rat race
Living in a rat race

I got sulfur in my veins
Devil watching through my eyes
I got beauty I got brains
And there's no one to defy
I've got the power in my fingers
And the opera in my hands

The onset of winter tonight
The mirror it gives me a smile

Living in a rat race
Dying in the rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in the rat race
Dying in the race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away
