Oh yeah
Young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
If you wanna rise from the hollow

The future in sight
The past in your head
Nightmare or treason
The father above you as you
Walk through the ashes
Don't you run out of reason

You keep waiting
For your choice to be made
There ain't no bounty
For the number of passions
You rein in for love

You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time

Pleasure and pain feel all the same
To the dreamer who's trying to get closer
Strange how it feels in reality
When your fairytale is over

No right or wrong
I just keep going on
And I don't get lost in belief

Falter and pray
Keep looking away
I don't wanna see

We keep on waiting
For a choice to be made
There ain't no bounty for the passion
We rein in for love

You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time
Forever is a long time
It's gonna take forever

Oh - young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
Wanna rise from the hollow
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time
