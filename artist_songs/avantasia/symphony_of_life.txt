Tonight, tonight, tonight
Heal me, heal me

Yes in the darkness of the night
I know there's someone near me
I can't explain but it's all right
As long as this won't leave me

I give to you my sacrifice
My virgin creed, my passion
I'm torn in two but all my life, my life
My life I'll wait for you

To near me
And reveal me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

Heal me

And in the deepness of my dreams
I know it's you that haunts me
In blood I swear my purity
And save my treasures for you

I give to you my sacrifice
And lay my burden down
Am I deranged that all my life, my life
My life I wait for you?

To cease me
And release me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

You haunt me, chase me like a beast
And with a taste so bittersweet
You love me, grieve me till I'm mad
Now is the moment
