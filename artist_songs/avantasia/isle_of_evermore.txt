[Muse:] 
From a frozen world will you take me over
All alone, sweet embrace
Leave the place I can‘t abide no more

[Aaron:] 
Take a look at ourselves, afraid to get closer
Will the predermination drive us to a distant shore

[Muse:] 
The tender velvet gown of destination left behind

[Both:] 
I‘m wide awake, I‘m on my way to evermore
[Muse:] 
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:] 
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
[Muse:] 
I'm dead to the world, you blindfold my eyes
while you're killing what I'm yearning for

[Muse:] 
You just see what your eyes have been told to tell you
Falling down to the ground, how come you ask if what you feel is true

[Aaron:] 
I'm staring at the maze and let it paralyze me
Watch it come alive and burn me out until I'm coming through
The tender velvet gown of slumber will just leave me just breathing

[Both:] 
Wide awake I‘m on my way to evermore
[Muse:] 
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:] 
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world
You blindfold my eyes
[Muse:] 
while you're killing what I'm yearning for
What I'm yearning for...

[Both:] 
Wide awake I‘m on my way to evermore
[Aaron:] 
And I turn around to fading shores
[Both:] 
I'll sail on through this opening door
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world blindfold my eyes
while you're killing what I'm yearning for
