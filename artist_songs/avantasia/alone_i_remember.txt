I've been walking down this road
With a suitcase full of dreams
I've seen my demons come and go
To show me what I need

Madness, walking dynamite
Been dancing on the edge
They got me by the fuse
Smiling with a match

I wanted love, I wanted life
Been striving for a new direction
I wanted out, I wanted more
I wanted to forget the damage left behind

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

Raise your head
Got stars above and emptiness below
Think of what you'd never had
And would have never known

You wanna turn your back on me
Condemn this pleasure dome
Make sure you won't regret
Mistaking friend for foe, no

You're at the gates,
You re on the edge,
I've seen them falling back to nowhere,
You re of the red, out of your head,
And you ll wish you haven t seen it all

I recall dream I had

When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

Oh and I recall I used to have a dream
I won't forget that moment of glory

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

I recall the dream I had...
