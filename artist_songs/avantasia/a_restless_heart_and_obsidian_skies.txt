[Spirit:] 
A genuine soul to dwell on baleful grounds
Glances wandering around
In the darkness of the world
Clouds have closed a ring around the sky
While the old ones hear the chimes
Through the darkness of the world

A genuine man will realize
He must fawn upon the times
While he shouldn't waste a word
Tender feet on stoney ground
See the young ones stray around
Through the darkness of the world

[Aaron:] 
Sacred heart will you usher me now
For I'll carry the lantern your way
For I'll bring us home

[Spirit:] 
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
[Aaron:] 
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
[Spirit:] 
Be still restless heart
[Aaron:] 
I'm on my way
[Spirit:] 
Under obsidian skies

[Aaron:] 
Wake to the sound of passing time
How could I quantify it in the darkness of the world
Wake to the shadow of a dream
Nothing's what it seems
As you brave the darkness of the world

[Spirit:] 
Ghost lights and matter
You'll know what is real
Perception and fact - all the same
Truth's what you feel

[Spirit:] 
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
[Aaron:] 
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
[Spirit:] 
Be still restless heart
[Aaron:] 
I'm on my way
Under obsidian skies

[Spirit:] 
And the wind and the rain that were shaking the pane
move onward along with the clouds
And you're gazing in awe at the ghost lights above
as if stars cut their way through the shroud
On and on and on...

[Spirit:] 
Moon shines
Ghost lights
Oh they reach out for you
Blazing the trail under obsidian skies

[Aaron:] 
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
[Spirit:] 
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart
[Aaron:] I'm on my way

[Aaron:] Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail
Be still my restless heart
[Spirit:] Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart
[Aaron:] I'm on my way
