Screaming - in silence you must carry
your secrets down this lonely eerie wicked road
Screaming - you're oh so battle weary
They say it's lonely at the top
Let alone when you hit the ground

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

The cross and you
The cross and you

Screaming from behind the mask of reason
The cautionary voice that shatters your brain
The silvery gleam of tomorrow
Keep accelerating in quest for a break
Until you realize that it's too late

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

All ablaze I plough my way
Till I am allowed to fall
I pay my dues on a ship of fools
I kick and scream and fight and crawl

Get a life! Don't waste time!
As we drown the voice inside
Till the moment I awake
When it's just the cross and me

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell's the shortcut you're rushing through
Just the cross and you
