[Jorn Lande:]
I am the master of the game that's made a fool you
I'm watching from the highest tower
You've got the aura to enchant them and a symphony
And I have got the power

You better taste: they call it life — my special area
I'm breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back on what you're given?
It's time to take your share

[Tobias Sammet:]
God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - to tear down the gate
And see what's inside

[Chorus:]
We rock the ball, been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion to take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: another angel down
We rock the ball, I'm facing my pain
A rage and a symphony driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

[Tobias Sammet:]
We'll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It's still so far away

There's no tomorrow, I don't remember yesterday
I'm just living for tonight
And all the love I'm not gonna waste no more
I won't spit what's divine

[Jorn Lande:]
They left you for dead - turning your head
Away form the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

[Chorus]
