The dial by the night
Seems like what it used to be
But now that this town has fallen silent
I feel memories
Of good intentions ghosting me

Watch the tower clock hand
Cut instants off each hour
From a future that has been devoured
Already by their craving for the vague
And even after lucid heartbeats
Few and far between
We're back to gain admission to the wheel

Bending the boundaries
Deaf to the memories
We won't make in the rush anyway
And God if you're out there
Why do you make me spin your wheel?

Do you hear me
Dweller I a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

The study and a sage
And ancient brazen luminaire
Just a bat flap from answers they wanna hear
They're evident
To every cynic eminent

Movement around the sun
All in eternal time
The heaven's fires turned to light
The moon that governs birth and then decay
The principle decreed
By laws you think you will conceive
And then some accident
To throw it all in place!?

Bending the boundaries
Don't run from your memories
I have been there before

Are you for real now
Or just a dweller in my dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

Oh, why would your
God give road lead to ruin?
Why would science challenge facts?
Why would your
God given will come off the track?
Come of the track?
Dweller in a dream?

Father do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the
Dweller in a dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream
