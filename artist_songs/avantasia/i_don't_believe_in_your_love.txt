[Oliver Hartmann:]
No one around to hear your cries
No one there to even realize you grit your teeth
What are you afraid to lose when you're left alone?
I'm the one to make you anything you wanna be

[Tobias Sammet:]
Never broke the silence, never broke the ice
No more waiting, I gotta wipe her off my mind
Loving her is dying, loving her is pain
Babylon I'm coming, ready for the fray

[Chorus:]
I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

Don't give damn for roses, no, no, no

[Oliver Hartmann:]
You've been standing on the edge, lost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy
Take your share boy straightaway, it's all heaven sent
She won't care: they call divine but it's all evil

[Tobias Sammet:]
Loving you was bleeding so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out its hand to save me from your sway
'cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
No angel left temptation, open up the gate

I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love

Don't give a fuck for roses

[Tobias Sammet:]
Loving you was bleeding, so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out it's hand, to save me from your swear
'cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
No angel left temptation, open up the gate
'cause loving you was wasting,

[x2]
I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

No I don't believe, I don't believe in your love
Your love, no, no, no, no
No I don't believe in your love
