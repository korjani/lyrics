[Aaron:] 
Who's got the answer
Is this what I'm looking for
And who do I talk to
What do I have to explore
[Magician:] 
Attend to your god given duty
You'll be taking your heaven by force
How could you choose
With your head in the noose
With no time to lose

[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Magician:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death, we're
[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Aaron:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways, we'll chain the light

[Magician:] 
Too worn out to wonder
We might not want to overextend them no more
Our beautiful spook lights are all they will need
All they will want to explore
[Aaron:] 
And after it's all said and done
We won't fear the transcience no more
Cause we don't realize
Idle glance in our eyes
Let precision prevail

[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Magician:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
we're
[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Aaron:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy way, we'll chain the light

[Mystic:] 
You look above
to see inside yourself
and find time standing still
You see the world in different light
You turn this moment
into what you think it's ought to be
Demystify the dark
[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Magician:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
we're

[Mystic:] 
High up in the open skies
[Aaron:] 
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways
