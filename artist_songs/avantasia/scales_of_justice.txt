Predetermination, belief
Veracity of incidents
Reconciliation
Between justice and tomorrow
You're innocent

It's only human to just close your eyes
Blinding fury, part of paradise
Heaven justifies

To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

You owe the power and your pace
To the brute that's running after you
Humiliation's growing hate
Righteous anger driving you

Cut off the hand
That tries to keep me back
Blinding fury, a piece of paradise
Cause heaven justifies

To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

Just close your eyes, just look away
What you don't want to know
Ain't gonna hurt you
Time passes by, we all die anyway
And no nothing remains
Whatever you say, whatever you do

To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even
