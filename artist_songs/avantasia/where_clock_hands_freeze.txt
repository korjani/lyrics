You're caught in the land of no sun
Without reason or rhyme
You're avid for splendour
The spin of the hand is your pace on the run
We got no time to turn
When we strive after grandeur

Here you got your hero slicing up your ecstasy
On the verge of lunacy
There's no time to lose
No chance to refuse - ah

Will you deny what you see
(as you) tear down the nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

I know what I see
And I know what I don't
Through your dark swamp
I walk on deductive conclusion

A little more time?
I admit I would take
But then again
It would mean more time for confusion

You think you got your prodigy
Everytime your eyes don't see
Victim of perplexity
There's no time to lose
No need to refuse

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze
