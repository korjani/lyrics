You turn off the light
And you won't make no difference
You hear the echoes fade away
When the cries of despair
Turn to a sound in distance
The road ain't divine
Black are the wings that will carry me home

Tower in the night, up to the sky
Carry our remains angel of light
To the dark side of Paradise

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

I feel how I faint as I'm crossing the Acheron
Wash away my innocence
Was I losing my away
When the sky has been blackened
This short cut of evil
Where do they drive me, where will I go

Days gone by time after time
I'm going insane, losing my mind
To the dark side of Paradise

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
