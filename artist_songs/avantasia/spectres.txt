Through the shimmer on this cold alley paving
See the moonshine painting the ground
Cobble stones keeping tales that remain untold
More than ages old

Brewing mist like a shroud on the damp floor
Hear it whisper lucidity away
Ornate cold is the king of these streets tonight
The void is taking hold

Make haste as the wind's getting colder
It's chasing the dreamer away

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

See them guises on the prowl, what a show!
Feel them shadows drag you into a nightmare
To the melody of which you don't know
If it's really there

Dance in the gloom, dance in the gloom
Every move is a step to your tomb
We're the machine that's gonna make you dream
Phantasmagoria

Time flies from the space of an hour
Telling tales in the poorhouse they say…

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes and a spectre is breezing
Cold is the night as you're braving the pale
Wide open minds - once upon a moonlit night…
