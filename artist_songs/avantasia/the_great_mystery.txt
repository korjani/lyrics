How could I let it get this far?
To the edge I've been drawn by promises
And what's the reason
For a heart to only misguide me
Blind me, tear myself apart?

When darkness falls and silence talks
At the edge of thoughts that you memorised
I'm the truth between the lines
They read and deny me and tie me to fantasy
And they'll curse this darkest hour
When in oblivion I'll die

Oh will you make me turn the page, one after another
If only you would make a mark the eye can see

You're dancing in around
Through the dark you long to find
Alight at the midnight t sky
To persuade the night

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
What if it's nothing but a dream
The great mystery, great mystery

We carry the flame to accelerate
The evolution of an age
Cast your eyes into the crystal ball - alright
We embrittle the weak that is'nt meant to be
We're gonna make it coronate the chosen ones
Who never sinned against their vocation

Don't be afraid: just look around
Don't question what your eyes can see

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
I've borne from my devotion

Oh she won't see me, she won't feel me
She's lost on her won, and so am I?

I see a cold moon rise above those empty streets
And I see movements part their lives
I hear the ticking leaving scars you can't conceal
Ain't it poignant how you try

Impatiently they're giving up on hearts
Whose signs they cannot read
As silence doesn't talk, eternity will cease

And as you marvel at the artwork in your hands
Rick in detail, so frail and beautiful
And you forget the rules
The elder's always made up for you
To save you precious time

You watch them pile up, they are saving on and on
Even you don't know where they store it all
You've got to be a fool if you don't save along
A thousand screaming
And silence doesn't speak to thousands screaming
No, silence doesn't wanna speak…

And I see tears shed over days when all was good
A child didn't care for what never really mattered

I see tears shed over days
When all was good and time
They had a lot to give away
When their hearts had eyes to see
And the final mystery
Was more than a fancy tale
And answers you did find
To dare what you would find inside, no

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain: 
you break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, give me one sing
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, send a sing
Oh is it really not a dream?
The great mystery
