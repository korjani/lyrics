Day after day I see her smile
If you could see her through my eyes
You wouldn't call her a little boy's fever dream

How can you tell my feelings wrong
How can't you see it's growing strong
Silicone angel you are my fantasy

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day I'm under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
I'm the parade
Though your love is evil

I feel how you watch my every move
Why do you lie to me and you
Your languidness shining through a crystal wall

Nobody would touch you like i would
Nobody would stop us
If I could reach out through the glass
Pretend you don't hear my call

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day I'm under your spell
And you look away
Cause your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
under your spell
And you look away
Though your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day I'm under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
Still I'm the parade
Though your love is evil
