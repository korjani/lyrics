Oh, I'm an open book
Turn the page and take a look inside
I'll be yours tonight
Cause you've got a hold on me
The kind that makes it hard to breath
But I feel so alive

Would you be my king if I lost everything?
Cause I'd be your queen through anything

Baby, baby, baby
Oh, you're killin' me with maybes
In my summertime dress, your hair's a mess
But you never looked so good to me

Baby, baby, baby
Oh you're drivin' me crazy
Got me singing' hallelujah
How can I get to ya tonight?

This ain't a fiction I've got a heart condition, a love addiction
I keep coming back to you
The DJ on the radio is playing songs that we don't know again
We'll just keep on dancing, oh

Baby, baby, baby
Oh, you're killin' me with maybes
In my summertime dress, your hair's a mess
But you never looked so good to me

Baby, baby, baby
Oh you're drivin' me crazy
Got me singing' hallelujah
How can I get to ya tonight?

I could give you everything you ask for
If only I could find a way into your heart
If this isn't real don't wake me up
Don't wake me up…tonight

Would you be my king if I lost everything?
Cause I'd be your queen through anything, anything to call you

Baby, baby, baby
Oh, you're killin' me with maybes
In my summertime dress, your hair's a mess
But you never looked so good to me

Baby, baby,
You drive me crazy
I'm bouncin' off the walls again
Hold me close til I say when
Just hold me close til I say when
Hold me close til I say when

Baby, baby, baby
Oh you're drivin' me crazy
Got me singing' hallelujah
How can I get to ya tonight?
