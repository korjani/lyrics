Stayed up all night talking, laughing all night
Just two strangers sitting there face to face
Feels like I've known you forever

And now and then I listen to an old piano
Little out of tune but it set the stage
Of you and me together
When I'm looking back I smile, wondering where you are

Sometimes, a memory's all you've got
And now and then I find myself living in a snapshot
In my mind, we're right where we left off
Holding onto a moment when time stopped
Yeah

You leaned in and I felt the flash
It happened so fast the whole night slipped away
Without us even knowing

Morning lights and taxi cabs that come too soon
And then it's just too late
To get back what was stolen
When I think of you I smile, wondering where you are

Sometimes, a memory's all you've got
And now and then I find myself living in a snapshot
In my mind, we're right where we left off
Holding onto a moment when time stopped
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Stayed up all night talking, laughing all night
Just two strangers sitting there face to face

Sometimes, a memory's all you've got
And now and then I find myself living in a snapshot
In my mind, we're right where we left off
Holding onto a moment when time stopped
Holding onto a moment when time stopped
You and me and a snapshot
