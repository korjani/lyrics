You come to see
What's been going on with me

Ain't got no doubts
As you sit down on my couch

Girl I feel low
Just thought you should know

So you blow your little smoke
Right in my face

Honey there's a lot of things
We should really, really say.

You know it takes time
But time doesn't notice
Not at all.

Got fired from my job
Cuz I was lying to my boss

My shirts all got holes
I got no money, no control

My soul's getting down
She said to me as she started to frown

Don't go blowing your mind on things
You'll never, never know

Sadly she said, I think it's time for me to go

God, love, and money
Is baffling me
And even though I'm losing you honey
There's just so much more that I need.
