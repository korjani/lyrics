Let's hop a train
And stow away
Down into Mexico

And on the way
As music plays
We'll let our beards grow tall

She don't like me singing songs
She don't want to sing along

It's still the same
She only likes me when I'm gone

I spilled my drink
Across the bar
Said, "Baby what's your name?"

Her boyfriend stood
And smashed a bottle
Over my head.
