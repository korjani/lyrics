[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Drop it low put it in the dirt

Then I drove off and put it in the dirt
Drop it low put in the dirt

Bubble butt busted in her throat
Smoking bubble kush wearin a bubble coat

[Verse 3: Mystic]
I had a cute thing, buenas noches
By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest
Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardic arrest
Make me come
Make me come
Come, we know you are the best
Who's bad?
Let me wind upon your cock
Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock
Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got
I ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'mma drop it like it's hot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe is not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin'.
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I load in my clip in and told her, 'Don't get nervous'
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, Bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker
Ball like a dribble
Put you on a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you, into you
Then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen, ass I need a 3D
