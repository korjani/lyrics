Stand up like a soldier baby
Yeah, I know you built like that
Gun it like a holster baby
Show dem say you wicked like that

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me
Gimme the ting and make me

Set it ablaze like a candle wick
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah light it up, set it a
Light it up, light it up
Light it up

Fire like a soldier baby
No retreating we nuh pree dat
Never make them hold you baby
Heart nuh feeble, we nuh take chat

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock

Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
