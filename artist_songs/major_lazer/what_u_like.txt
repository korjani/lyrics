Don't you like it when me shift your drawers one side
And roll on a condom and slide me stiff dick in-a ya fat pussy
Make ya feel like your home a tear down like a landslide

Make you reminisce, all yourself you a feel up

Ah, that she like, she love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night

Hear me now, when me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, ahe love it like her life

Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night

That's why me give you cock, what tough like it is a brick hut

Wind 'pon the cock, it up, 'pon it you have it tick tock

Hear me now, when me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, she love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night
