Dear, just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me
So just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me
Hear my appeal
Major Lazer!

If my mother ever see she’d be dead
They know me baby with ya, off every little led
We got outer doors, sleeping after bed
My polar bear style, come edom to zed

I bet you have something to tweet, the way oh you suck
You have to send a tweet, 3 up when we bunk
A lady in the sheets with the poor slide chuck
You know me love seeds, you see it

I’m about to send me clear,
Make this thing sound like Osha & Nina – so sweet
I can make the latter rear
Straight to it, come be where I go
Oh just ah I go

Wo oh oh oh
You punch with me man, we done sittin there
Infinite like with mind without sittin there
And low boy make one bad without sittin there
Woah, just sittin there
Woah, just sittin there
Now something here is so special

I keep think it walks on amaranth
You think the jump on dance like carnival
Yet now we walk on bite like no carnival

So give me, give me hard
Give me, give me, sweet
Give me, give me right enough to make it on the street
Me a bad liar but men are quiet clear
Give me give me give me
With the heels on the feet

Just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me
So just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me

Wrap around my salta and you feel my pepper spray
Hey! can’t get away (no!) can’t get away
Now we’re stuck together ha! Metal drippin sauda
Bangin on my ovaries and bustin my piñata
Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki leak
Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki leak
Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki stop

Chewing on your buttock and I have it like a murder
Go Odee go! Go go go
Go Coddy be up! Go go go
Go Odee go! Go go go
Come Coddy go! Go go go

Dracula, thank you for starring
Wolf Man, Invisible Man
And Harlequins
Your skin

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

[x2]
Just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me
So just scare me
My mom’s away, your either can’t scare me
