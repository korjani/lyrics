[Ellie Goulding:]
Oh my my my, what you do to me
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
When you put your body on top of mine
Everytime that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

[Tarrus Riley:]
O lord of mercy
I'm begging you, please
I'm feelin' drained
I need love
You charge me up
Like electricity
Jumpstart my heart
With your love

[Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding:]
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

[Ellie Goulding:]
I couldn't leave if I wanted to
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of you lingers
My mind running wild
With thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
Or you could give it all
But it's never enough, no

[Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding:]
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

[Ellie Goulding:]
When you hold me in your arms
Burns like fire and electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity
