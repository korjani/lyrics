[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Baby got ass like a trunk
Took her from her man, he a punk
She got a body like Baywatch
I met her at the Playhouse
Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo
Is you really with the shit, though?
Really, is you really with the shit, though?
We got champagne and vodka
Goons with me if they need a problem
Fuck niggas, hate real niggas, get money
All muhfucking day
Baby drop it to the ground like yass, bitch
Back it up like yass, bitch
After the club, I'll smash it
We don't cuff hoes, we pass it

[Wizkid:]
Girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba

[Kranium:]
Short shorts, batty rider, we'll cock up

Take her outside, go smash it pon the avenue

Me introduce them to each other, other, other
Man a galist and me stand so forever

[Wizkid:]
Girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
