I know my brain is worth bigger than your Stock
When I be spitting never want me to stop
I got that fire in me ready to explode
And when it happens feel that wrath of my load
Like 'damn woman' you got me when you get up on top
Like 'damn how you do it' with that rhythm you got
Well now I'm driving till you get out on the road
And wind you up, wind you leave you shivering cold

Now I'm gettin' ready for you
Gimme the wanna get
You wanna get ya tripling up from the mitzy.
Baby you better sit down
Take ya back til ya wanna get off the ground again
Lemme tell I gotta you when ya pick up 
Is that the time when ya think about me
All your talking bout busy bad boys forget about me

I Make Ya [x20]
Wah dem a Call
I Make your Jeans
Vibrate Like a Nokia
