Now, in comes di ting called Major Lazer
Number one sound inna dancehall
We stand tall, sound boy diss and fall
That's all

We ready fi di war
I see di fear in a ya eyes
I can smell your desperation
But we have dubplates galore
Major Lazer sound
Yes we rule di nation
Tonight a little drum pan will die
Sound boy eradication
And it no really matter what you try

Stiggy diggy diggy don,
Well reggae music a di peoples choice
Use this riddim and make your sound play nice
A Major Lazer, a knock dun di place
Now di time to test out di BASS
Now make it ROLL, ROLL, ROLL...
Now make it
Now make it

Stiggy diggy diggy don,
Well reggae music a di peoples choice
Use this riddim and make your sound play nice
A Major Lazer, a knock dun di place
Now di time to test out di BASS
Now make it ROLL, ROLL, ROLL...
Now make it

Killing sound

We ready fi di war
I see di fear in a ya eyes
I can smell your desperation
But we have dubplates galore
Major Lazer sound
Yes we rule di nation
Tonight a little drum pan will die
Sound boy eradication
And it no really matter what you try
This is the final destination

A Major Lazer, a knock dun di place
Now di time to test out di BASS
Now make it ROLL, ROLL, ROLL...
Now make it
Now make it
