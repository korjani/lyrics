And oh what a time and a season
For love and greetings

Oh and you brought some gifts for me?
I see, Major Lazer

What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound
What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound

Mi make a vow you ago low mi marijuana
Love it from the day mi daddy show me marijuana
Hills a sainty a weh me a grow mi marijuana
So low mi marijuana please

What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound
What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound

When the sen similla scent reach the senses
It kinda senseless to not see what the sense is in
Why we spend these $100's, $50's & $20's
On trees growing for centuries
Make you can't finish your sentences
And it seems weed has been in my genes
In my jeans I used to stash it in my teens
By any means though
When the greens grow from high grade weed stalks
That make you cease talk ease off
And flu by jack and him beanstalk though

What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound
What a Merry Christmas would be
If me get a ganja stalk fia Christmas tree
And New Year's Eve when them a count down
Me a count pounds a the brown brown
Weh just reach in town how me sound

HoHoHo
