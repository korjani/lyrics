[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Gucci Mane:]
Neck and wrist water
Frozen, cold water
Your ex went hard but Gucci go harder
You say he do it big but Gucci went larger
I just want to spoil ya, escape to Florida
Charter us a plane and fly away from Georgia
Have you been to Spain? Let's tour Barcelona
Put you in LA like Prince did Apollonia
Please don't wear that dress you wore last time, I wanted ya
300, 000 dollars on one ring I taunt ya
You never get me after one night, I hunt ya
Cause the stick got power, it can go for hours
Cause this chick so bad, make you take a cold shower

[Justin Bieber:]
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go (I won't let go, no no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[MØ:]
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

[Justin Bieber & MØ:]
I won't let go, no no, no no no no
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Justin Bieber:]
I won't let go
I won't let go
