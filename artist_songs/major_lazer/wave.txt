Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh

Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better oh
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

If you gotta trust me, if you try to rush me
I'll go back to rush over like a wave
If you gotta fight it, always tryna ride it
Let them just rush on you over like a wave
You see when I'll give the world
Diamonds and rubies and pearls
It's safe to say that I am your girl
Now get a little bit closer, say it to me
Why would you tryna fight it
Something so natural
The wave comes, you gotta ride it
If you wanna stay afloat

Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better oh
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

Tell me that you're wrong in mine
Promise that I'll take the time
Nobody likes a lazy lover
One step forward, two behind
Tell me, am I outta line
For letting it take me over
Oooh, baby it's out of control
Tell me, coming crashing down
Promise you won't let me drown

Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

Oh boy really make me, find
Boy really make my life
Boy really make me
We could make everything better
Promise you won't let me drown
