Now this is a story about my girlfriend Mary Jane,
(Mwaa hahahaha Mwaaa hahahah!)
You ready mini me? Okaay,

Hello, Mary Jane, I can't get you off my brain
Take me higher then a crane
You're so sweet like sugarcane (cane)

(I'll keep on flyin...)

Girl you must be my fairy
You give me wings like a canary

Mary Jane I love you dearly!
I always want you near me
You make me see clearly like
