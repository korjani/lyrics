I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Welcome, the door we open
If you’re section, surely find your way around it

Good things not promised it’s a fight
As long as you are glad then your future can be bright
Any ‘cause nobody knows what the future hold
So what you do is be pass it and things that now you signed
Don’t forget the past but focus on the future
High on a dream line, Martin Luther
The youth they monek it if they find out enough
The young fissing my brothers then my live life love it
Oh yes I’ve been through it
So I come telling to do, just do it
Because I knew it
Life’s not easy, non-tall
But you can be the one that don’t fall
The summer, I’m for one, oh I’m for love

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Welcome, the door we open
If you’re section, surely find your way around it

How long before we see that love’s the only way
And though the struggles that we juggle it will be okay
Are we immune to what is true? The message on the air
Was short to confusing, take my life out of my bed
We lose some power and it’s hard to find the way
But it’s so simple to supply it
Our bodies but start much slow
Try to escape but there’s nowhere to go
In the land of make believe, focused on the wrong thing
Ain’t half of what you see like here’s the enemy

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Welcome, the door we open
If you’re section, surely find your way around it

Some is ordering to mothering
Old fashion to them other in
If this was a guest it took no other
Gots me, I got tired of chew life up my limy island
So who no like it then can ask that be suicidal
Getting through to me and I threw it to yourself
Respect me if you not view yourself
You don’t wanna do to me, you don’t want to lose yourself
Nothing is so stable, all lucid and data
Your life start on to amaze me, like fine but don’t be lazy

If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around
If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around
