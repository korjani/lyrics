Major Lazer
Yo find this

[Bridge]
Can’t hide from me, me say me boy I’m to be high
I was born to be, born to climb
Can’t hide from me, me say me boy I’m to be high
I was born to be, born to climb

Gangsta

Get on Patron, run grab by your phone
Get on Patron, run grab by your phone
Get on Patron, run grab by your phone
Get on Patron, run grab by your phone
To the rhythm

Oh oh oh oh what a pity
Be smoking and joking until I talk stupidity
I am so higher than the city
Be fly in the clouds, what a view, so pretty
I’m such a bad boy, P Diddy
We got them notorious like Biggie
You smoke, smoke like a chu chu train
This, I grace, coming through the brain
To the brain
To the brain
To the brain
To the brain

In the sky, above the clouds,
With the birds, with the birds
Sky, above the clouds,
With the birds, with the birds

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Put them up! Hands up!
Put them up! Hands up!
Hands up! Put them up!
Hands up! Put them up!
Put them up! Hands up!
Put them up! Hands up!
Hands up! Put them up!
Hands up! Put them up!

High like a jet like a jet blue jet
High like a jet like a jet blue jet
High like a jet like a jet blue jet
High like a jet like a jet blue jet
