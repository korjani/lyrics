9 9 9 ‘Cause I be so up
I see the way it’s transact like a buck
Like I’m not nothing to worry about
Bucket get your check before the jet stuck
Tic tic tic no really time
Come on feel the bass, jam to make me way long
What make me bass strong
And tear the gate down, I take it straight down
Now stop, boy you feel me?

The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio
The radio

Everybody down and under stop!

Gyal stop til me say the sun shine and leave me alone
My never for the siren kill
Stop jump with the encore, go in and up up up
Don’t stop the man firing
Come depload, depload perfect timings
Stands the close but don’t stop the grinding
Watch the right conquet, everybody dining
Now just stop

The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio, you sweat
The real radio
The radio

The real radio
