You know I'm never right
If I'm not right with you
And no one can make me feel like you do
I'll be the one to lay my heart down
On the line
So come and save me, darling
Love me one more time

Cause you're not always right
(Ooh, and I'm not always wrong)
It's not like I don't try
This is where we belong

One way, everything's gonna be away
But darling, I'm on your side
Cause it's a one wheel, four hands
Two hearts trying to understand
How we're gonna get there
When we're both trying to drive
We're both trying to drive

You might be right
And I'm out of touch
I guess everything I had to give
Just ain't enough
I'm trying to make the most
Out of what it's not
Cause darling I can't give you something I ain't got

Cause you're not always right
(And I'm not always wrong)
It's not like I don't try
This is where we belong

One way, everything's gonna be away
But darling, I'm on your side
One wheel, four hands
Two hearts trying to understand
How we're gonna get there
When we're both trying to drive

I can feel it under my seat
On the sideline of my life
Watching rain fall to the ground
To the beat of the same old fight
Every song is brewing this war
When we find ourselves in the thick of it
Give a little bit
And we'll fly, we'll fly, we'll fly

One way, everything's gonna be away
But darling, I'm on your...
Darling, I'm on your side
One wheel, four hands
Two hearts trying to understand
How we're gonna get there
One wheel, four hands
Two hearts trying to understand
How we're gonna get there
When we're both trying to drive
Trying to drive
