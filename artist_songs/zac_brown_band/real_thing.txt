It was in a crystal bottle on his desk
He'd save it for the times to not forget
I miss the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was

One sip and it blew my mind
Those good ol' boys sure make it right
Knowing smooth whiskey takes some time
Ain't nothing like the real thing

And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everything is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby

Thought I'd been in love a time or two
Didn't know that I was lost till I met you
And I could tell that every other girl was history
Never knew how real could feel till you found me
All it took was

One kiss and you blew my mind
An All-American kind of fine
You know a good woman is hard to find
Ain't nothing like the real thing

And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everyone is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

The real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing

You know a great song is hard to find
The right words and the perfect rhyme
'Cause we all feel the same inside
We're all looking for the real thing

You know you're not the same once you hear it play
There's nothing else that can replace
What's genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
