It's just an old piece of wood
On top of four legs
It's got a few coffee stains, and a thousand marks from "God knows when"
Ain't too many thing's, that could stand the test of time
But this family table's held together by a love that never dies

So won't you come on in?
Supper's almost done
Go ahead and call your friends
'Cause we got room for everyone
Let's make some memories, 'round this 9 foot pine
Pull up a chair and stay a while, at the family table
Family table

It's the corner stone that held us all up
Through the best of times
And be that way when times got tough
We blew the candles out
In our walk through time
This family table's, bound together by a love that never dies

So won't you come on in?
Supper's almost done
Go ahead and call your friends
'Cause we got room for everyone
Let's make some memories, 'round this 9 foot pine
Pull up a chair, stay a while

Gather round, hand in hand
Close our eyes and bow our heads
Thank the lord for everything he's done, and for everyone
At the family table

So please come on in, when your work is done
Go 'head and wash your hands
And gather 'round with everyone
Makin' memories, 'round this 9 foot pine
No other place can ease your mind, like a family table
Family table
Like a family table
Family table
Family table
