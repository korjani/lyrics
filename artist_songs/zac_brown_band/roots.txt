My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home

Ohh I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my
Roots I'm home

Every Friday you could find me
At Dixie Tavern playing with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

Ohh I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my
Roots I'm home

We'd get 'em singing "Don't Stop Believing"
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreaming one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flying high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

And roots always keep me grounded
Roots remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my
Roots I'm home

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots remind me where I'm from
My roots even when I'm a thousand miles away from my
Roots I'm home

Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
[x4]

Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only gives you stronger roots
