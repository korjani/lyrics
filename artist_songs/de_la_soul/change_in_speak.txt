[POS:]
Once again it's time to bite more soul 
A flavor you will savor in your soul 
Wax is distributed and then sold 
So watch it turn, bring your next of kin soul 
P.A. Mase has rocked it on the console 
Scream real hard until you blow your tonsils 
Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles 
'Cause you are now dancing to the big soul 

[DOVE:]
Live is the motion of the soul step 
Set the exposure to my one step 
This scene'll last to the next step 
All those in favor take a big step 
True to the Soul, we'll never back step 
In sense to that, we don't half step 
Just as a reminder from the last step 
Negative ones are lost in footsteps 

Levels we've set will never go down 
Competitions commence the step down 
Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down 
Can see that the Soul has got a new sound 
Dance until you find yourself a new part 
If you don't then I'll give you the True part 
When received you'll see the real small part 
Of the new way is no part at all

Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace 
Movements always walking round now stressing peace 
When this biter should know true in peace 
Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef 
Still we are professing to be on a roll 
Public cause this party going on the road 
And if you crave sex, drugs and rock'n'roll 
Sent by the Quest, Jungle and De La Soul 

Give 'em a taste, Mase
