[POS:] Living in everyday is something, 
Something everyday like this is our livin' 
[DOVE:] Giving something sheer for the crowd is our major, 
Major to the crowd is to hear what we're givin' 
[POS:] No time to rest, we got work in the studio 
Studio suppliers rest at no time 
[DOVE:] Showtime is enough when the Soul is performing, 
Performing is the Soul y'all, and it's showtime 
[POS:] Coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge, 
Lounge with the homeboys how we are copin' 
[DOVE:] Scoping new material for Paul to plug high-pitched, 
High-pitched what Paul plugs in and still scopin' 
[POS:] Bearer of peaceful views to express peace, 
Peaceful expressions why we are bearers 
[DOVE:] What the Soul tries to project is when existing in rap, 
You're living in a fulltime era

[POS:]
Puttin' in spin the rhyme, rappers fear so 
Fear so much of what Pos is puttin' 
Couldn't do better, the punks they don't try hard 
Try hard enough, they don't, so they couldn't 
No joke to what I do inside this field, 
This field to me is filed, there's no joke 
So soak up the fact there's no part-time, 
Part-time rappers at, so soak 
Taking in new ideals leads to new groups, 
New groups to better the Soul, I'm takin' 
Wakin' from days and nights to do my best 
[DOVE:] Your best gets us paid 
[POS:] So I'll keep on wakin' 
Wearer of a Plug logo to the dying, 
Dying are rappers who think I'm no wearer 
What I'm trying to say is when dealing in rap, 
You're living in a fulltime era

[DOVE:]
Love is to all, to all goes my love 
Dove comes to peace like stand comes to sit 
Stand for the court, 'cause standing is healthy 
Healthy in sense is mentally fit 
Pause for the poets of a new style of speak 
Just here to do the same with no trick 
Grab the Plug Two's live wire, my brother 
And find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict 
Ring goes the garbage I'm hearing 
Seek for the truth, my brother is tearing 
No time to back-step, 'cause if you back-step 
Look what you stepped in, you stepped in mess 
So look what's around you 
Don't worry for the Soul will find the truth 
About three years from now, you know why? 
'Cause we're living in a fulltime era
