[JEFF:] Yo yo, hey man, ain't you guys um, Plug One? Plug Two? 
Potholes in my Lawn? You're those weird guys, De La Soul, right? 
[DOVE:] Yeah, what's up little man, how you feeling, I'm Dove, how you
feeling. 
[POS:] Yo what's up man, my name is Pos. 
[MASE:] What's up, I'm Mase. Yo, shorty, what's your name? 
[JEFF:] Oh, my name? Jeff. You guys are walking? Now rappers ain't
supposed to walk. 
[POS:] Sorry little man, but you know... 
[JEFF:] Jeff. I told you, my name is Jeff. If you guys are rappers, 
where's your dukey gold chains? Y'all don't have no dukey gold chains. 
[MASE:] We don't wear gold chains, we'd rather spend our money on 
more important things like, women, necessities... 
[DE LA SOUL:] And video games! 
[JEFF:] Y'all are crazy. No chains, dag. Okay, where's your BMW? 
You're not supposed to walk. Where's your jeeps, your Maximas? 
[DOVE:] Maximas? Yo, Maxin' would break my flow. And with the cause of 
gas, Jeff man, I'd rather take the transit that's mass. 
[JEFF:] What you say? You are C-R-A-Z-E-E. Crazee. Don't you know you 
can't be def if you don't have no gold? Or a car, man? What's up? 
[MASE:] Who told you that? 
[JEFF:] Everybody who's def has gold, cars, money, girls, clothes... 
[MASE:] Wait a minute, wait a minute, shorty, you're buggin'. Do you like
Plug Tunin' and
Potholes? 
[JEFF:] Yeah that song's def. 
[POS:] But we don't wear no gold chains, nor do we ride BMW's and 
Maxes or Jeeps, yet you still think our music is def, right? Wait a
minute. Did I say 'def'? 
[DE LA SOUL:] Rrrr-RRAH! 
[JEFF:] What? 
[POS:] Nothing, nothing. It's just that we don't deal with all that 
materialistic stuff, but we still got what it takes to please and 
supply our listeners, understand my man? 
[JEFF:] Where's your beepers? Why don't you have beepers? Everybody 
wears beepers. You have to have beepers to look down. 
[MASE:] AAAUUGHHH! Little man is brainwashed indeed! 
[DOVE:] Nah, nah. Beepers are the least of status situators, man. Plus 
I find them ugly as parking tickets. 
[JEFF:] You guys talk funny. 
[POS:] Well actually our verbal is kinetic, so when released flow A to 
Z is perfectly pitched in andvance in intricacy. 
[JEFF:] Yeah you homeboys are really bugged. 
[POS:] Wait a minute. Did he say... 
[MASE:] Bugged? 
[DE LA SOUL:] Rrrr-RRAH! 
[JEFF:] So no car, no beepers, no gold. That's weak man, that's weak. 
[DOVE:] Jesus, did he say 'weak?' Jesus, they never learn. 
[POS:] Foolish mind, have I, have I. 
[MASE:] Actin' like that lady! 
[DE LA SOUL:] That lady! 
[POS:] Peace, my brother...
