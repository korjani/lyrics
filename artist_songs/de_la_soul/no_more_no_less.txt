(Three's the magic number)
(Yes it is)
(It's the magic number)
(Yes it is)
(Three's the magic number)
(Yes it is)
(It's the magic)

You go difficult preachin' is Posdunous' pleasure
Pleasure and preachin' starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in the measure
Measure in the music breaks in three parts
Casually see but don't do like the soul
Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name's Brewster, Brewster's a punky
Parents let go cause there's magic in the air
Criticizin' rap, shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires
And don't get mad sir Mase is smashin' your daughter
A tri-lateral system is now set
As usually stands for Da.I.S.Y productions
It stands for "da inner sound y'all" and y'all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing of a function

(No more no less)
Three's the magic
It's word to Jake yo', we indeed
(We don't have to guess)
The Maseo, Plug dos and me
We tally up to make the number (three)

Focus is formed by flaunts of the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who be honoring the scroll
Scroll written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen, cause this here's wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Yo, set aside a substance that you feed 'em
Now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you clap baby, clap!
