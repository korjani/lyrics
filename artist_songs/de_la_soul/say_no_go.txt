Now let's get right on down to the skit 
A baby is brought into a world of pits 
And if it could've talked that soon 
In the delivery room 
It would've asked the nurse for a hit 
The reason for this? 
The mother is a jerk 
Excuse me, junkie 
Which brought the work of the old 
Into a new light, what a way 
But this what a way 
Has been a way of today 
Anyway push couldn't shove me 
To understand a path to a basehead 
Consumer should erase it in the first wave 
But second wave forms relievers 
And believers will walk to it 
Then even talk to it and say 

(You got my body now you want my soul) 
Nah, can't have none of that 
Tell 'em what to say Mase 

(Say no go) 

[DOVE:]
Nah, no my brother 
No my sister 
Try to get hip to this 
Word, word to the mother 
I'll tell the truth 
So bear my witness 
Fly like birds of a feather 
Drugs are like pleather 
You don't wanna wear it 
No need to ask that question 
Just don't mention 
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy 
But the statement she made 
Held a plate of weight 
I even stressed it to Wade 

[DOVE:]
Did he take any heed? 

[POS:]
Nah, the boy was hooked 
You coulda phrased the word "base" 
And the kid just shook 
In his fashion class once an A now an F 
The rock rules him now 
The only designs left 
Were once clothes made for Osh-Kosh 
Has converted to nothing but stonewash 

[DOVE:]
Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun 
But don't hop in if you wanna be down, son 
'Cause that could mean 
Down and out as an action 
What does that lead to? 
Dum da dum dum 
People say what have I done for all my years 
My tears show my hard earned work 
I heard shoving is worse than pushing 
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher 
'Cause a pusher's a jerk 

(Say no go) 

[POS:]
Believe it or not 
The plots forms a fee 
More than charity 
But the course doesn't coincide 
With the ride of insanity 
Is it a chant that slants 
The soul to fill for it? 
I know it's the border 
That flaunts the order 
To kill for it 

[DOVE:]
Standing, scheming on a young one 
Taking his time 
8 ball for a cool pool player 
Racked it all 
Tried to break, miscued 
Got beat by the boy in blue 
Next day you're out 
By the spot once more 
Looking hard for a crack in the hole 
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff 
Word to the Dero 
The answer shoulda been no 

[POS:]
Run me a score from the funky four plus one more 
(It's the joint!) 
Rewind that back 
This is the age for a new stage of fiend 
Watch how the junkies scream 
For their crack 
"It's the crack"t should explain it from the start 
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart 
Now the Base claims shot over every part 

(Say no go) 
(Say no go) 
(Don't even think about it) 
(Say no go) 
(Say no go)
