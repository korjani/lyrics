(Play it for me) 
(Kick it!) 
(The mic men are back, okay) 

[DE LA SOUL:]
Girls, girls, girls, girls, 
These girls I do adore 
Walking down the street watchin' ladies, 
Aaow, watchin'... 

[MASE:] 
Hold up, hold up, let's give it to the Mack Daddy 
over to the left... 

[JEFF:]
Pity pity pity pity wack wack wack 
A moo moo moo, a jumping jack 
Rock this is brain now I'm one step over 
Respect your parents, they're pushovers 
Chasing my fun like the IRS 
My girl's too young to have big breasts 
For a good time we chill by the mall 
I tell her tales, some small some tall 
Why, how you got peanuts, pecans, 
I wipe her cheek, she grabs my hand 
I have a curfew, she says to me 
I'll take you home, look hon, you'll see 
The deed was done and I thought to myself 
Jeff, you're the mack and no-one else 

(Jeff, I told you, my name is Jeff) 

The astronomical wiz, dazzler of the showbiz 
Kids of the new biz for you 
Don't try to solve it, just involve yourself 
In this deadly De La dialogue 
Yo, I smell black fog 

[POS]
That's right, me and Mase blew it to clear your ass straight out of this sector. This is De La Soul wax! 

[MASE:]
So wait until your own piece of wax come out! 

[LUCKY:]
Yo, is this true? Is Jeff really coming out with his own song? And if he
do, will he have the
decency to 
change his name to a suitable public speaker? Yo, I don't know, but
bring in that funky
astronomical piano 
For this is the take-off man Luck signing off.
