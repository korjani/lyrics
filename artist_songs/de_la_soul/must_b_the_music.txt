I do boom bap, don't do cool rap 
Don't mind a little radio on my coon wrap 
We do it for the love, yeah, the love of money 
Use it to pay for food so don't go hungry 
Do trips to the Caribbean, do skiin' 
Don't mind me, just do it so free! 
Do want the good life, don't delay 
Why put off tomorrow what I can do today! 

Oh yo, been there, done that murder 
Gun rap, pay dues don't pay checks, so run that 
High hopes don't sleep, don't do cheap seats 
Up front, on stage, where's the fuck that 
Blizzed in diamonds, see me shining 
Dudes do they best to scratch the grinding 
Better like who done it, so ya'll who won it 
Don't believe the hype you simple Simon 

Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 
Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 

It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most 
It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most 

OK do's, you love ‘em 
Tell ‘em, hug ‘em, 
Make ‘em high on life without having to drug ‘em 
Don't dare ignore them, lie ‘em, bore ‘em 
Holler at their sister, mom or cousin! 
Do the dishes, but don't break the china 
Don't make faces, especially not behind ‘em 
Don't get caught, she'll get support like 
Late for her birthday, get it in the worst way 

Wine, champagne, tickle her with bubbles 
If she say do it, do that shit on the double 
Break up, make up, don't hold no grudges 
Make sure you tell her if I make up smudges 
Compliment her hairdo, fuck it more champagne 
You need to do it before you get the girl campaign 
Wife her, life her, exchange the I do's 
Anniversary, don't let her remind you 

Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 
Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 

It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most 
It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most 

I don't carry no firearms 
I don't carry that security 
The guns for hire arms 
What I will do is admire my own 
If it ain't my concern I leave it alone 
Unless 
It's a fly girl then I do the right thing, make it a night thing 
And do the do 
And if she don't refrain from the choo-choo train 
We'll let it all hang, and she do the crew 
(all aboard) 

I do alot of things that don't make sense 
What I don't do is ride the fence 
Hence, the reason for the season 
Of the haters that jump on stage and get bathed in tomatoes 
Do to the mic that we use to clash in 
In comparison to us of the MC's trash 
Don't got the skills don't pursue it 
It ain't nobody else's fault 
So don't do it 
Freeze! 
(when the music come back sing the chorus, please) 

Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 
Must be the music 
Got me in a trance, making me high 
Must be the music 
No escaping this, don't even try 

It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most 
It's them do's and don'ts 
They're movin' the most
