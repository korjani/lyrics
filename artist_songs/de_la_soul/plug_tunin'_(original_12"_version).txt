[MASE:]
Yo Pos and Dove, stand clear to be plugged up into line one and two 
So y'all can flaunt the new style of speak 

(And good luck to both of you) 

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One 

[POS:]
Answering any other service, 
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted 
Enemies publicly shame my utility 
After the battle they admit that I'm with it 
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue 
Transistors are never more shown with like 
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin 
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm) 
(Mmm-hmm, yeah) 

Flowing in file with a new style 
Barrels are cleaned and loaded for salute 
Chanters with the choice standing steady like my mouth 
This paragraph preacher is now introduced 
Drums are heard sounding off on each and every person 
Vocal confetti is blown at top stage 
Roses and violets aren't proper for throwing 
When showing appreciation, why? This is a Daisy Age 
Hands won't sweat 'cause there's no threat 
Mic will stay dry while pitchin' so loose 
Rhymes aren't fables but stable to be on time 
'Cause they're marketed and labeled sticker 'Posdnuos' 
This pitch will fit with every consumer 
Microphone loosed in cycles, start blooming 
Profit and cost should never be lost 
All due to a clue of a naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm) 
(Mmm-hmm, yeah) 

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 

[DOVE:]
Dazed at the sight of a method 
Dying at the death of a neverending verse 
Gasping and swallowing every last letter 
Vocalised liquid holds the quench of your thirst 
Reasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown 
Different individuals are dazzled with the showbiz 
Auditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather 
Hold a count at three and in the end leave it as it is 
Flow to the sway of my do-re-mi 
Leaving are fixed lunatics who will hawk 
Words are sent to the vents of humans 
Then converted to a phrase called talk 
Musical notes will send a new motto 
Every last poem is recited at noon 
Focus is set, let your polaroids click 
As they capture the essence of a naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm) 
(Mmm-hmm, yeah) 

Vocal in doubt is an uplift 
And real is the answer that I answer with 
Dying yet live, what you must realise 
That the tune that I present is surely not a gift 
Different in style is definite 
And style which I flaunt is sure legit 
Now set aside, I say I hold pride 
In performing this melodic misfit 
So swing 'cause this pitcher is pitching 
In sense JD Dove is now saying 
All sing along to his favorite song 
While the pocket transistors are playing 
But least but not last I'm frightened 
For the words that I reply hold doom 
Life of the check can be stopped by accident 
When you're tripping the wire of the Plug Tune 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm) 
(Mmm-hmm, yeah) 
(No-one that I know can live my life for me) 
(Are you ready for this?)
