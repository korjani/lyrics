(It's Delacratic) 
If I want to I could jump off this building. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I could hold two pieces of doo-doo in my hand. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I could call everybody in that room a rubberneck. 
(It's Delacratic) 
Come on, please? 
(It's Delacratic) 
I can say anything that I want. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I could wave my hand in my air. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I could stick my hand up my nose. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I could hold my foot and count to three. 
(It's Delacratic) 
I can do anything. 
(Possie? Dovie? Masie?) 
(Pass my bag.)
