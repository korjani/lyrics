(And now for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics. 
Perhaps the most famous classic in all the world of music...) 

[DOVE:]
The first time around, you didn't quite understand our new style of speak. 
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now) 
So why don't you all just grab your bags 
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor, and we'll be off) 
(And good luck to both of you) 

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One 

[POS:]
Answering any other service, 
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted 
Enemies publicly shame my utility 
After the battle they admit that I'm with it 
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue 
Transistors are never more shown with like 
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin 
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm) 

Flock to the preacher called Pos 
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew 
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma 
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew 
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior, 
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe 
See that the three will be your thread 
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know' 
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway 
From my flower girls China and Jette 
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic 
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet 
Negative noise will be all divided 
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon 
Ducks and kizids will all be rid 
When paying position to the naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm) 

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two 

[DOVE:]
Freeze 'cause these are the brothers 
Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick 
Every last viewer is tuned to the method, 
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick 
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two 
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz 
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth 
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative 
Flow to the sway 'cause I say fa-so-la-ti 
At the top we will dwell 
Difference is fame and we rise then we build 
Where we are set we get fat and we swell 
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride 
One step forward is the space we consume 
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume 
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called 
Plug Tunin' 

Vocal is local so believe that 
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap 
Trying and live so you best realise 
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap 
Style of the Tune is personal 
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all 
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy 
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all 
Watch while the pitcher is pitching 
'Cause this is the pitch of the year 
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong 
Though you heard Dove crying 'I ain't fair' 
Those who think De La's on the flip tip 
Try to flip this and you're doomed 
Watch for the B-B 'cause if you try to grieve me 
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune 

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm) 
(I can't twist your arm and make you stay with me) 
(Are you ready for this?)
