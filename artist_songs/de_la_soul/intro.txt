[Al Watts:] Okay. Now we've met the contestants, let's get to 
the game! I'm going to ask an amount of four questions, and 
the contestants will try to answer them correctly. Now, you 
out there in the audience can answer along with them. 
How many feathers are on a Perdue chicken? 
How many fibres are intertwined in a Shredded Wheat biscuit? 
What does "touche et lele pu" mean? 
How many times did the Batmobile catch a flat? 

Now that we know the questions, we'll let the contestants 
think them over, and we'll return right after these messages.
