("Nasty, ain't it?") Uh-huh.. two times
I'm the D to the... yeah

{"Vocabulary spills I'm ill - plus matic
I leave your brains stimulated" - [Nas]}

[Dave:]
Yo, I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lie
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my loss
So I can earn the acres the houses and the horses 
Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is the apex, uh-huh
Much too complex, effects be live like Das
Making moves down South, to avoid the bull
And never, flaunt the coin cuz dime-getters be gazin
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin
Fazin those who're supposed to have the last laugh
Even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the af'
I haveta, send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champagne hoes
Taste the quarter pound from here to New York
Don't swine, don't eat no pork~! Who am I?
The D to the...

("Do it again")
("Nasty, ain't it?")
Hey, I'm the P to the..
{"I leave your brains stimulated" - [Nas]}

[Posdnuos:]
Yep, I'm the most, coast, Eastern flav'
Droppin more knowledge than litter on your New York pave'
It's me, wonder why, place to be
Certified, as superior, MC
While others explore to make it hardcore
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door 
of rap, rhyme-y sometime
When we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see
the lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling
My rhymes escalates like black death rates
Over music plates, being played as the rule
Kids thinking stepping to the crew, you're labelled fools
who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching
We don't give a shit on what crew you run, or what section of earth
you reside, you're not even a man, nigga!
Yo, you not even a man, nigga
And I'm a man, cause my man said Soul for the life
You cried "Keepin it real", you should try keepin it right
That's understanding microphone mathematics
Leaves the currency in temporary world status
And when one shows he posed threat to this one
This one will make that one into none
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from
And I'm the P to the...
