Access to her code 
Lovestruck was my mode 
Took a look, dropped my textbook 
Jenifa... (OH!) 

Breakfast, broke it fast 
She was in my English class 
Asked for notes, rocked my boat 
Jenifa... (OH!) 

Jenny 
Lost her favourite penny 
So I gave her a dollar 
She kissed me 
(And I hollered) 

In a flash the school bell rang 
Jenny grabbed on to my hand 
Took me home and said, Trugoy just 
Swing and swing and swing

The downstairs, where we met 
I brought records, she cassettes 
Lost the breaks, found her shape 
Jenifa, oh Jenny 

Transcripts showed more than flirt 
'I love daisies' read her shirt 
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed 
Jenifa, oh Jenny 

Marvelous 
Shaped like a vase 
No one can live their life for Pos 
Found a house, aroused my joust 
Jenifa, oh Jenny 

Her clothes, I did shuck 
Just like Dan I strictly stuck 
To the punt, she cried 'kick it' 
Posdnuos was in 

Jenny 
Only thought about Jimmy 
But asked was I a virgin 
Like some kid named Derwin? 

She said 'Let's try it in the bathroom' 
But 'Dnuos is way above sinks 
So to the kitchen she did Dan 
And came back wrapped in Saran 

(Now wait a minute! Little Derwin got something to 
show us that Jenny could never do. Listen...) 

(Hey. Look at little Derwin. Look at him go, look at him go! 
Awww, baby.)

Positions, muscles flexed 
Dove was lost in a Ghana hex 
Passed her test, felt her teddy 
Jenifa oh Jenny 

Notions 
Soothed the mood 
Dove was lost in De La heaven 
Screwed Plug Two, did the do 
Jenifa oh Jenny 

Jenny 
Teased my homeboy Granny 
In fact she teased so many 
She was known as a garden tool 

[POS:]
No more 
I dispatched 
Was it Jimmy had met his match 
Or could it be the realisation 
All girls owned a Jenny 

For normal health 
I had fought 
A valuable lesson she had taught 
Don't flaunt that the candy is good 
Unless you came with plenty
