(Mary had a little lamb) 
That's a fib, she had two twins though 
And one crib 
Now she's only fourteen, what a start 
But this effect is ground common in these parts 
Now life in this world can be such a bitch 
And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch 
Negative's the attitude that runs the show 
When the stage is the G-H-E-T-T-O 

[DOVE:]
Which is the one to blame when bullets blow 
Either Peter, Jane, or John or Joe 
But Joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk 
And Peter's pimping Jane, and John's a punk 
Infested are the halls, also the brains 
Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains 
Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown 
The kids are all alone 
'Cause it's just the ghetto thang 

IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD) 

[POS:]
Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule 
This title is sought by the coolest fool 
Define coolest fool? Easy, the one who needs 
Attention in the largest span and loves to lead 
Always found at the jams, but never dance 
Just provoke violence due to one glance 
The future plays no matter, just the present flow 
When the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O 

[DOVE:]
Lies are pointed strong into your skull 
Deep within your brain against the wall 
To hide or just erase the glowing note 
Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat 
Truth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar 
Those who blame the G for all bizarre 
So open up your vents and record well 
For this is where we stand, for the True tell 
Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways 
Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play 
If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range 
Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change 
Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact 
They lie like ghettos form, 'cause people lack 
To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold 
The truth they never told 
'Cause it's just the ghetto thang 

IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD) 

[POS:]
Do people really wish when they blow 
Out the cake candles, and if so 
Is it for the sunken truth which could arise 
From out the characters in which the ghetto hides 
Roses in the ring supply their shown relief 
Granted it's planted by their shown belief 
Kill and feed off your own brother man 
Has quickly been adopted as the master plan 
Posses of our people has yet to provoke 
Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke 
What causes this defect, I don't know 
Maybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O 

IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD) 

Standing in the rain is nothing felt 
When problems hold more value, but never dealt with 
Buildings crumbling to the ground 
Impact noise is silent sound 
But who's the one to say this life is wrong 
When ghetto life is chosen strong 
We seem to be misled about our dreams 
But dreams ain't what it seem 
When it's just the ghetto thang 

IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)
