If it's not De La Slow, then it's not WRMS. Where Cat's in control,
twisting and tuning until you're purr-fectly content. Special cat
call goes out to the suckers at the donut shop. Thanks for serving it
to me dark, hot, and no caffiene. Snuggle tight and hang loose
boys, it's time to groove to a De La Slow move on WRMS.
