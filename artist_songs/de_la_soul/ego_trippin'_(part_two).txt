Yep, yep big trucker man's rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do
I got the joints to make ya...(JUMP!)
Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout you're so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot, I'm the foot but who's steppin'
(Ain't no half steppin')
You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play wit it cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world!!
You gots to gimme gimme mine cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Watch the way I say it (ego trip)
Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up
I never did it
The flavor's bein' butt but brothers ain't gettin' it
Get it; or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna lamp
Cause it's the chattanooga champ
Takin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...

Word is born I'm a livin' phenomenon
Well I'm a better brand cause I'm a superman

I got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss
Cause DJ Paul, he's down wit us
Now people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke

Sometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal

Bigger than bigs, dig it (I dug it)
Ways that amazes popes

When the tides taught me the ropes
No weights for the baits (man I'll give you four)
For a verb unheard of (man gimme one more)
Alright you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on
(And ain't a damn thing happenin')

Who can be (fresh)
Who can be (dope)
Who can be (nice)
