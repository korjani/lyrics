Now is the time for sleigh bells to ring
Now is the time for children to sing
Now is the time for white Christmas for Bing
Because it's Christmas time.

Now is the time to hang mistletoe
Now is the time to run through the snow
Now is the time to sing old Rudolph's Nose
Because it's Christmas time.

Christmas time is a-comin'
Santa's not far away
You can almost hear his ho ho ho
And the jingleing of his sleigh.

Now is the time,
Christmas stories we will tell
Now is the time,
Hang your stocking on the nail
Now is the time,
Let us sing Jingle Bells
Because it's Christmas time.

[Instrumental]

Christmas time is a-comin'
Santa's not far away
You can almost hear his ho ho ho
And the jingleing of his sleigh...
