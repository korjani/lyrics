Oh, you say that you're goin' away and leave me
And you say you ain't never coming back
That you're sick and tired of how I'm doing
And you're gonna head off down the track.

But darlin' before you go be sure you know how much I love you
And that I'm sorry for the quarrels that we had
If you leave you're gonna tear my world to pieces
So take it slow be sure you know before you go.

[Instrumental]

Oh, your wounded pride has blinded your reason
And right now you want to hurt me if you can
The man is waiting here to take you to the station
And you're leaving with your ticket in your hand.

But darlin' before you go be sure you know how much I love you
And that I'm sorry for the quarrels that we had
If you leave you're gonna tear my world to pieces
So take it slow be sure you know before you go...
