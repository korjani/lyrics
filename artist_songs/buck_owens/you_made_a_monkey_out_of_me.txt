I feel like a monkey in a cage
Everybody's laughin' in my face
I might as well be livin' in a tree
You made a monkey out of me.

You made a monkey out of me
You got me crawlin' on my hands and knees
Even got me swinging through the trees
You made a monkey out of me.

[Instrumental]

Well, the way that you walk on me it's true
I might as well be livin' in a Zoo
Everybody laughs at what they see
You made a monkey out of me.

You made a monkey out of me
You got me crawlin' on my hands and knees
Even got me swinging through the trees
You made a monkey out of me.

You made a monkey out of me...
