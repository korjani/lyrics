Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you

Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
Now I hope and pray with each new day
That you'll come a-travelin' home

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you

I watch the mailman comin'
I wait by the telephone
I meet the trains down at the station
And I spend my nights alone
But now the waitin' is over
And Time has set the scene
'Cos God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
