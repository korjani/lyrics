If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine
I'd be a tramp and sleep in the street
Or I'd be a beggar with rags on my feet.

If I knew for sure
When the time comes to part
Someday in heaven
You'd be my sweetheart.

Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we've crossed the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine.

(If I should go first and leave you behind
To face life alone bear this in mind
I'll be a waitin', if heaven's my fate
To take you by the hand
Just inside the pearly gates.)

Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we've crossed the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine...
