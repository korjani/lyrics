Where does the good times go?
Where does the river flow?
Where does the north wind blow?
Where does the good times go?

Lips that used to burn with love
Now are cold beneath my touch
Still I love you, Oh, so much!
Where does the good times go?

Where does the good times go?
Where does the river flow?
Where does the north wind blow?
Where does the good times go?

Arms that used to hold me tight
Eyes that shone with love so bright
Now have changed like day to night
Where does the good times go?

Where does the good times go?
Where does the good times go?
