My child, my fleeting hour has come,
There's no mercy for me, no pardon
Close my eyes, I know you're overcome
And I have failed to guard you

Over mountains, through the meadows,
You travelled far from home
By the hand of your father
I'm left, abandoned, alone

Hear my voice, remember who cradled you
Who loved you and swore to guide you,
Through the darkest hours of your life,
Return to me, if only tonight

My child, let your kisses console my heart,
Revive me with your smile
All is gone now, now all is lost
Hear me plead for one last goodbye

Over mountains, through the meadows
He carried you far from home
By his hand, the hand of your father
We're left, abandoned, alone

Hear my voice, remember who cradled you
Who loved you and swore to guide you,
Through the darkest hours of your life
Return to me, if only tonight

Hear my voice, remember who cradled you
Who loved you and swore to guide you,
Through the darkest hours of your life
Return to me, my child
Let us reunite
