I am down at the water 
My bare feet are numb 
And for aeons now nothing seems real 

Now it's hard to hold sight 
Through your soft eiderdown 
But I still got my hands on the wheel 

you have set my mind 
between worlds spinning round 
I'm a stranger in my universe 

But I see my sun 
And I know that it will 
Be forever shining on earth 

You can rain down on me 
But you can't darken the sun 
You can cast a spell on the moon 
But you can't kill the sun
