[Part 1 - Awakening]

Father, oh father you told me to see
The world with my eyes and not just believe
So I was learning from the old books
The wisdom of a time that no-one know

I've seen our freedom
In the mist of time
The old signs I'll follow
For the day of relief will be yours and mine

Mother, oh mother you told me to go
Where the sun will lead me away from the snow
I have turned for a last goodbye
Now I do know it's my fate to try

I've seen our freedom
In the mist of time
The old signs I'll follow
And the day of relief will be yours and mine

[Part 2 - The Machine]

For years I have been searching
To find the missing blueprint
In corners of my mindscape
Deep inside those shades

The answers are a secret
Forbidden by the black kings
They keep us in this prison
Slavery is our fate

In the dark I can see
What nobody else can see
Oh this world is a cage
How can we all ever be saved?

I'm making my contraption
A strange machine construction
Einstein to Hawking see me
Watch me build your dream

This device makes me go
Where nobody else could go
To the past, to warn you all
So the sword can never fall

Fly! Fly away, fly away, fly away to the days
To the days, to the days, to the days in the haze, to the days - in the haze of time
We all will be together again
Fly! Fly away, fly away, fly away to the days
To the days, to the days, to the days in the haze, to the days - in the haze of time
Laying our hands on the uncertain

I'll change the world for you
We all will be together again
Flying through space and time
Laying my hands on the uncertain

"How fragile your childish dreams
Ignorance, ha! It suits you well
No ray of light shall accompany you
For it is darkness, in which you dwell"

[Part 3 - A Parallel Sphere]

All stars falling down
Such gold, such green, gleeful they gather
Stirring the sky like I've never seen
An emerald bee tingles my brow
Until it dissolves into a puny sea
Hear the hollow willow, hear!
Like a miser weep
Like leviathan shrieks
I fear - my delirium's here - it's here and now:
Are there monsters out to get me?
Who will tame or heed their growls?
Who is mocking me, who dares to?
Show your face, come forth now!

This new world you found might seem unreal
Who is mocking me, who dares to?
Mirror to your mind and to your soul
Show your face, come forth now!

We will abduct your senses forever
We will lead you into your dark night
You will give in to all the drugs served here
You will feel like you are dreaming

Slowly you'll forget where you came from
No power left to stay strong

"Yes, it's true... now you are my creature... a puppet in my theater of dimensions
The key that will unlock the entire universe to me!
Soon you will do all my bidding and you will be unable to escape this waking nightmare!"

[Part 4 - A battle of Minds]

I'll take you down with me
And I will steal your memories
You'll never be released
And you will never live in peace

You came here you fool
And now you will serve as my tool
My demons will haunt you
And I will use your powers soon

Laughters rises from the darkness
Whispers from a smiling carcass
Creatures of your childish nightmares
Grab you with their rotten fingers

Monsters and ghosts dance with you in a labyrinth
Demons and clowns laughing loud while you're suffering
Witches delude you with their dark sorcey
Taking you down into hell's fiery kitchen

Fear, only fear
Fear is everywhere
We can see your strength is fading
In your mind, a last chance waiting
You will turn your demons back on him

I can see my strength is fading
In my mind, a last chance waiting
I will turn my demons back on you

So you want to fight
Yes, I will free my mind
No, you cannot win
Hahaha! I'm not going to give in

What is happening?
Now your creatures are with me
Oh what have you done?
Now it's you has to run!

Oh world, bright abyss
Let us reminisce
Come dawn's warm embrace, all hearts will be...
Sanctified, saved and whole
Turned away from evil's toll
To free the world from its cage
Lay me down into my grave

Fly! Fly away, fly away, fly away to the days
To the days, to the days, to the days in the haze
To the days - in the haze of time
Wish we could be together again

Fly! Fly away, fly away, fly away to the days
To the days, to the days, to the days in the haze
To the days - in the haze of time
Caged in this parallel dimension

I changed the world for you
Wish we could be together again
Flying through space and time
Caged in this parallel dimension

Who dared to mock me? Oh!
I stood my ground, fierce and proud!
O let me living die!
The dark's defied, the time is nigh!
Till death does come, till death does come!

[Part 5 - Home in a Dream]

Children, oh children, when you'll be born
Your world will be no longer torn
I will watch your from afar
Down on our little blue star

And you'll see your freedom
In the mist of time
The old signs you'll follow
For the day of relief will be yours and mine
Finally it's yours and mine
