Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is calling
All hear the oceans howling
Voices of the Fallen

Under a black moon rising
We set our sails again
Our hearts are filled with sorrow
Living our curse

Oh, how long must we sail
Until we're released?
Oh, set us free!

Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is calling
All hear the oceans howling
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten
All we know is gone now
Come along with us!

It was a long time ago
We found the hidden gold
A treasure so exciting
We lost our souls

Oh, now we have to sail
Until we've released
Oh, set us free!

Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is calling
All hear the oceans howling
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten
All we know is gone now

(When we may go home,
We'll take one final life.
This blood alone
Will pay our price).

Our hunger's neverending,
Cannot be satisfied.
Our thirst is everlasting,
Within our mouths it all runs dry.

Oh, we're lost!
Ghosts in the shadows.
Oh no! Creatures unhallowed.

Someday in a final storm
We will get back our mortal lives again!

Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is calling
All hear the oceans howling
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten

(When we may go home,
We'll take one final life.
This blood alone
Will,
Will pay our,
Will pay our price).
