Silver stars in my black night
Cold as ice but beautiful
Wandering through broken shadows
The river of life is all filled with sins
The water I drink is the blood on my hands

No-one sees how I'm burning
No-one feels this yearning
So come taste this black poison - You never reach this heart
And forgive my obsession - Something tears me apart
From myself

Silver stars in my black night
Cold as ice but beautiful
Wandering through broken shadows
The river of life is all filled with sins
The water I drink is the blood on my hands

Waiting for my damnation - your prosecutor's here
In my own accusation - you can't run from yourself
Oh we're living these lies all alone
So come on and throw the stone

Silver stars in my black night
Cold as ice but beautiful
Wandering through broken shadows
The river of life is all filled with sins
The water I drink is the blood on my hands

Pray to the gods I have sold in this game of live and let die
Pray for my soul in this world to deliver me from my sins
Pray...

All that's been and all I see now
Only a ghost of what I called...

Silver stars in my black night
Cold as ice but beautiful
Wandering through broken shadows
The river of life is all filled with sins
The water I drink is the blood on my hands
