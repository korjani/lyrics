When the sun is down and the moon is up
Our story will be told
Oh when they call our names and we raise our cups
We are bound to the ship of doom

We will call you all to gather
We will bring you fantasies
We are born from smoke and fire
We will sail the seven seas

One, two, three, four - can you hear the cannons roar
Five, six, seven, eight - it has been too long a wait
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve - now we need to raise some hell
So now sing with us

Oh we have come to your town with our following
To bring you light but we're gone very soon
We are the kings of a world that has never been
Oh we are bound to the ship of doom
The ship of doom!

One, two, three, four - see the hungrywant some more
Five, six, seven, eight - Take it now or it's too late
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve - Soon it's time to leave this place
We will not forget

Oh we have come to your town with our following
To bring you light but we are gone very soon

We are the kings of a world that has never been
Oh we are bound to the ship of doom

Oh when the sun is down and the moon is up
Our story will be told

See the lightning. Feel the thunder. Come and fight
Take us further. Bring us closer. To the glory
Take us further. Drowning deeper. In the story

Once we're home from the storm and the seas
There is nothing we will regret

We will call you all to gather
We will bring you fantasies
We are born from smoke and fire
We will sail the seven seas

We will call you all to gather
We will bring you fantasies
We are born from smoke and fire
We will sail the seven seas

Oh we have come to your town with our following
To bring you light but we're gone very soon
We are the kings of a world that has never been
Oh we are bound to the ship of doom

When the sun is down and the moon is up
Our story will be told
Oh when they call our names and we raise our cups
We're bound to the ship of doom

Bound to the ship of doom
Bound to the ship of doom
