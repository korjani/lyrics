Take my life and paint it black
Until I'm sleeping
And my promise, I take back
So please stop creeping

I don't call your heart my own
Where I rest my head I'm home
You are here to please me

You know my name
I don't know yours

Stay until the curfew calls
And kiss your idol
Beneath your black-hair waterfalls
You look so bridal

You know my name
You don't know - me
