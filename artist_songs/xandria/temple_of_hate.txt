Every day I am facing a new way of chasing
The dreams I am losing in constant defense
The world keeps on turning, the beds are still burning
In foolish unconsciousness and self pretense

Take it away, take it away, free me
Take it from me, take it from me now!
Falling astray, falling astray faster
Only to see how...

Deep in the shadows it's hiding for me
Down there the demon is rising
Coming to carry my soul down with him
Down into the temple of hate

All the ways that are leading into hell's open ceiling
Are carrying names so familiar to me
It's so hard to stay who I am when your knifes
Rip my heart out and hit me again and again

Oh, please help me – Oh, let me be

Take it away, take it away, free me
Take it from me, take it from me now!
Falling astray, falling astray faster
But I will keep it under the surface of my smiling face
No-one can see what's behind this mask for the world
I am wearing all time so I can survive
Because...

Deep in the shadows it's hiding for me
Down there the demon is rising
Coming to carry my soul down with him
Down into the blackness of the temple of hate
