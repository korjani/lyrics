I've been dreaming all those years
I've been sleeping for so long
In a diamond sky of lonely worlds

All your eyes stare up at me
As if I was wide awake
And I only can live my own curse

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment

I will send a dying rose
For you all to be close
To its scent that has never been

All the colours to unfold
All the magic we behold
In the life we share in fantasy

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment

Say these words again
Don't leave me alone
When my own dreams have finally died

Keep my dreams now
I keep yours forever
Save my hope now
I save yours forever

Hold me, help me
Carry me upon your wings
To save my soul with your love

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment

Say these words again
Don't leave me alone
When my own dreams have finally died

Keep my dreams now
I keep yours forever
Save my hope now
I save yours forever

Hold me, help me
Will you be my dreamkeeper?
