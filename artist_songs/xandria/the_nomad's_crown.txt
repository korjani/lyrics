Silent are the winds as he travels forgotten lands
Outcast, yet not fallen, and no-one knows his name

May the winds do once rise again
May the magic be strong to stand
For the dark and the light to come
Soon to an end to give a new way

Over the mountains from the tower above the world
Secrets were given for in his hands to unfold

Will the winds do once rise again?
Will the magic do lead his hand?
For the dark and the light to come
Soon to an end to give a new way?

For this contest to end
Not from hell or heaven sent
To renew the beauty of all
All of the kings have to fall

It's been a long way from the forsaken prison
Seeing the downtrodden ones serve false masters
The rivalry of gods must end here once and for all

Knowing the desire for the crown will lead nowhere
Down there in the fire of the forge it has to burn

Now the winds do rise again
Now the peace will come to the land
For the dark and the light to come
Now to an end to give a new way

We wait for you only - release our world, unfold it
The beauty, the broken - come forth for us and heal it
Be the one, you nameless - and leave us with our freedom
Our freedom
