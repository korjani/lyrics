Speak to me one last time, smile at me once more,
I cannot bear this distance, our memories galore
In lucid dreams I’m dancing, my cries echo unheard
Your soul now deaf to my every bitter word
My muted love, may you rest forever
Cradled to the sounds of this lullaby:

In our sweet atonement we slumber secretly
We’ll never comprehend that we never should have been
Oh this true love story is buried in memories

Let me crawl inside you to open your weary eyes,
Heal the wound that broke you, recover all goodbyes
My muted love, when were we raided?
Who dare leave us, jaded and torn

In our sweet atonement we slumber secretly
We’ll never comprehend that we never should have been
Oh this true love story is buried in memories
And my voice was silenced the moment we started to dream…
