See me
Heal me
Lead me far from this worldly abyss
See me
Heal me
Lead back to the emptiness of home

One step too far the story broke
Inflamed no more the embers cold
Aghast at last cast down this smile
The word is out no need for high-hat lies

Wake from your secret slumber here comes the tide
There will be no salvation all is a lie
Find that the world has fooled you and left you torn
When the walls came down heartache was born

Entangled smiles the haunted kind
How to restore what's left behind
All recomposed by a faltered fate oh!
My tainted soul's a masquerade

Wake from your secret slumber here comes the tide
There will be no salvation all is a lie
Find that the world has fooled you and left you torn
When the walls came down heartache was born

See me
Heal me
Lead me far from this worldly abyss

We are the scars from your mind
The most restless of dreams
We are the best that you can be
Return and see: without us you will feel misunderstood!

Wake from your secret slumber here comes the tide
There will be no salvation all is a lie
Find that the world has fooled you and left you torn
When the walls came down heartache was born
