Sometimes I'm holding my breath and keep still
When all the world's closing in for the kill
I try to embrace all the treasures I have
At times, though, I think I'm losing my faith

All I have forsaken while the time is flying
I am watching all my lives passing by
And I'll...

Run this road till the end
While the world is turning around me
I don't know wherever I will land
Bound to the unforeseen

I see the starting points fading behind me
All of the races have always been waiting

All I longed for is gone, all the children unborn
I can only let them live in my songs
So I...

Where is the moment that I should caress
When it's only yet to come
Nothing is waiting for me
Nothing

Run this road till the end
While the world keeps turning around me
I don't know when it's all over and gone
So please let me have just one more chance
