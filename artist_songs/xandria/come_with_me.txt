I belong to a world of twilight and regret
Sing my song to the ones who never hear it
The spell is cast, time is frozen for eternity
I know it lasts only till the sun is rising

Sinful is my heart, my darling
Let me share with you

Come with me to a place far away
Come enter the world in the shadows

All my scars are painted with the blood that I once have spilled
My old heart had to see it all to win my freedom

Sinful is my soul, my darling
Let me share with you

Come with me to a place far away
Come enter the world in the shadows
See through my eyes and feel what I feel
Come take my hand and just dare to believe

Come with me to a place far away
Come enter my world
