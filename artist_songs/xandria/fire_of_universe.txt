I clench my fist and break my chains
Destroy the mirror of tears
I force the night to smash you down
And lose my innocence (I'm)

Blinded by the fire of universe
I'm falling down, no reverse

I Can't rewind my life to then
When I was freaming ot warmth
You took away the child I've been
And left me frozen (and)

Rewind rewind to then -

I'm an angel
Born form the breath of life
An Ikarus
Burning an falling down
