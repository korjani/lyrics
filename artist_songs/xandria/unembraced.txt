I see the beauty in the miracles revelead
I need the golden sparkles just to climb the tree
But sometimes I get scared and find it hard to stand
When all the violence is coming down on me

Sometimes I wonder

How can we ever be strong in this world
Without a hand that can lead us unhurt
How can we look into this empty face
All of us unembraced

I taste the bitter truth that makes me understand
There are some questions that might never be answered 
And all their poison sweet, the prayers and belief
Just let them gently sleep while I must stay awake

How can we ever be strong in this world
Without a hand that can lead us unhurt
How can we look into this empty face
All of us unembraced

I'll stay awake
I'll stay awake

Oh can we try to be strong in this world?
We are the hand that can lead us unhurt
Beauty of lies deep in the wonders unveiled
Love is the mirror for us to be free

Now take a look in our universe
Are you still unembraced
