Thou art my shelter When sorrow calls
Thou art my unknown grave where I belong
My heart and heaven refrain from song
Until I'm guided into thy bright...

Bloodred lines against my ivory skin
Hear my heart still beating from within

Bridges may burn heavens might fall down
I will return I will be homebound
I'll cross the land the boundless sea to sail towards thee
Shelter of bliss saviour of my soul
You are my world you are my unknown
Grave where my heart is home

Slowly sinks the blade into my chest
Lift it up to bury your hands

With every beat away from thee
I say my rhyme and take my leave...

Bridges may burn heavens might fall down
I will return I will be homebound
I'll cross the land the boundless sea to sail towards thee
Shelter of bliss saviour of my soul
You are my world you are my unknown
Grave where my heart is home

Hush be silent no tears nor tempest sighs will do
Don't weep don't plead only thy bright eyes...

Once I walked with destiny but that was all in vain
Now love dows have a name
Lift my beating heart out of its chest
With you it can be laid to rest

Bridges may burn heavens might fall down
I will return I will be homebound
I'll cross the land the boundless sea to sail towards thee
Shelter of bliss saviour of my soul
You are my world you are my unknown
Grave where my heart is home
Home where I belong

Thou art my shelter
Thou art my saviour
Thou art where I belong
