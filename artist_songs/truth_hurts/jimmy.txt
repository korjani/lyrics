I got the story now listen up 
I got this story about this player named Jim
He used to get down for me 
When ever I told him he could come get plenty 
He got the remedy my bills was paid 
He got me laced fell in love instantly
Than I got the call one day said jimmy's gone away
The pantry 
Its no mystery 
Now he cant come around no more
He's locked up for 10 or more
I could have just flipped your door
Well I'm gonna miss ya thats fosho 
[phone call]
Shut it down homie  I got you just tell me what you need
Wont forget you when I'm out boo
Just to show love for me
What a feelin' start to use no lie
Dont give a damn I sacrificed my life
I got your back until the day you die hell yeah I'm strong
But baby I dont like this
You cant come around no more
Your locked up for 10 or more
I should have flipped your door
I'm gonna miss you thats fosho ooh....
Why did you have to go....
I'm a miss the time we spent we should've run away
I'm a keep it tight while your gone but you'll return one day
I'm a miss the way you put it down at night
After all is said and done
