Take no offence to this speaking from my own experience 
Theres a price to pay when you get caught up no telling
What you'll get but you can lose the same
With no respect never seen the real through all the dark

You have a patient love yes you do
And dont believe everything you hear
Just let the truth be known 
push force like rain

First you caught up no things genuine
push force like rain
So caught up by the hype and nonsense 
Let the truth not change

I can see straight through clear people heartless & spineless
Tryin' to fit in kissing my joy with pain its all in vein
I'm just a jem in the city tryin' to survive   

You have a patient love yes you do
And dont believe everything you hear
Just let the truth be known 
push force like rain

First you caught up no things genuine
push force like rain
So caught up by the hype and nonsense 
Let the truth not change
