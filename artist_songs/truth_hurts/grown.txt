When I think about it when I got so much that I just cant complain and if I choose to believe something
new you cant con sev  cause the thoughts are confined how you gonna find the nerve to believe that you
thought you'd be mine he's what I feel inside 

I just dont wanna be misunderstood nobody telling me whats wrong or right bad or good cause I'm grown

disrespected that should be respected thats right above restriction of opinions how ever I whatever I  

Don't think I'm selfish don't let it be a day when I'm feeling that the world is mine oh I'll make  no
mistake cause its alright and even if I'm feelin' like I wanna complain that my right and if I choose to
lie, cuss, buss, or fight damn right
