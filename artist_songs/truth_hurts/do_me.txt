It's three o'clock
Are you coming by my spot
I'll was feeling sexy, but I guess your not
Never available when I really want it
So what I'm gonna do, is what I got to do

Ohh Wee, yes I got to do me
If this is how I got to get mine on
At least I know it won't be wrong

Cause I know how to please me
If this is how it got to be
And then the thing do me
Like I do when I'm alone

Ohh Wee

As long as you ain't trippin
you don't even have to worry bout me
You know nobody does it like
You know how to do it but me
Well, if somebody doesn't come along and handle this permanently
I know how to love me, see

Ohh Wee, yes I got to do me
If this is how I got to get mine on
At least I know it won't be wrong

Cause I know how to please me
If this is how it got to be
And then the thing do me
Like I do when I'm alone
Ohh Wee

I'm gonna please me yeah
Break it down, break it down
Oooohhhhhhh, Weeeee

[Chorus repeat]
