Wake up & shower we gonna meat in an hour 
I'm already shaking my anticipation loosing my patient yeah 3 days I've been waitin' 
Cant get no concentration what do you think I want
Dont want adime of your money Dont want movies & roses 
What do you think I want I want to hear moaning I want touching and kissing
You'll know when its real when I wake you say oh
That feel good you know how you can tell when its real 
Sexual healing its much more then feeling my heart needs healing
And I anit even trippin' I'm crazy about us
He knows how to work it and he knows how to twork it  
What do you think I want I want a little conversation 
We both know our intention 
What do you think I want 
I wanna see couch pillows rolling I wanna see wrinkles in covers 
You know when its real it'll make you say oh that feels good
You know how you can tell its real it'll make you say oh that feels good
