Hey, baby
Come here for a minute
I've got something to say
It's coming from my heartm, baby
From a real woman 
Listen up

[Verse 1:]
Say....
I'mmmm not afraid
To admit that I'm weak and I can't get enough of you
Baby, Damn
What you doing baby
Are you trying to make it harder for the next man
Making me feel like a woman should and its all good
But ohhh, Lord
Why you ever introduce me to such a feeling 
Cuz I'm caught up
And I got no shame put my pride aside forget the age
Some woman they thinking that I'm all about me
so glad you came along and made me believe
Cuz' its notabout love or making it feel real deep
Sugar I thank you for making it reall for me this feeling......

I can't contain it
It's more than love
