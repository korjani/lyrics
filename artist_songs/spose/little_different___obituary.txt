[Verse 1 - Spose:]
I was too rap for my rock friends
And too rock for my rap friends, back then
I never ran enough track for the jocks
I never rocked enough black for the goths
So hello ma'am, I wasn't in the commercial
I'm the parallelogram that didn't fit into the circle
I was undefined like the slope of a vertical line
I'm who they doubted when they heard he could rhyme
But can't stress the enormity of nonconformity
And how importantly it played into me even recording these
Songs for the underdogs, raps for the outcasts
Blending in with everyone? Spose isn't about that
Falling in line never sounded fun to me
So I marched to the beat of my own drum machine
I found my rhythm even if I didn't fit in
If you didn't get the vision when I spit it look

[Hook 1 - Spose:]
I'm a little different, I'm a little different
I'm a little different, I'm a little different from you
And if you don't like that, and if you don't like that
And if you don't like that, fuck you
I'ma be me, I'ma I'ma be me
I'ma I'ma be me, till the day I die
And if I change or decide to stay the same
I can because it's my life

[Verse 2 - Spose:]
I got no usual rapper story, don't fit in no category, don't give me no labels
I use distorted guitars, I put all big words in my bars, somehow put food on the table
And I don't know no one else who got the same taste as myself, homie I don't care if you get me
And I don't fit in no group, if you were to sit in the coupe, you see I got Weezer and Biggie
See I like rock stuff, rap's sweet, odd duck, Black Sheep
I always been a little bit different
Been in the left field, too weird, black nails, blue hair
I never fit the descriptions
So get enlightened, go and buy a lamp
Kick it with me outside the venn diagram
Spizzy, I found my rhythm even if I didn't fit in
If you didn't get the vision when I spit it, look

[Hook 1 - Spose:]
I'm a little different, I'm a little different
I'm a little different, I'm a little different from you
And if you don't like that, and if you don't like that
And if you don't like that, fuck you
I'ma be me, I'ma I'ma be me
I'ma I'ma be me, till the day I die
And if I change or decide to stay the same
I can because it's my life
It's my life

[Hook 2 - KGFREEZE:]
So hang me if I'm ordinary
Go write my obituary
And hang me from the cemetery gates
See I just want to be remembered
As that spark, that burning ember
That made it through the cold December night

[Hook 1 - Spose:]
I'm a little different, I'm a little different
I'm a little different, I'm a little different from you
And if you don't like that, and if you don't like that
And if you don't like that, fuck you
I'ma be me, I'ma I'ma be me
I'ma I'ma be me, till the day I die
And if I change or decide to stay the same
I can because it's my life

[Verse 3:]
I can't stress the enormity of nonconformity
And how importantly it played into me even recording these
Songs for the underdogs, raps for the outcasts
Blending in with everyone? Spose isn't about that
Falling in line never sounded fun to me
So I marched to the beat of my own drum machine
I found my rhythm even if I didn't fit in
If you didn't get the vision when I spit it look
