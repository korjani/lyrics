[Spose:]
How am I doing? Not so good, man
It's not my fault

[Verse 1 - Spose:]
I drink Mountain Dew after Mountain Dew then drink a Pepsi
I haven't exercised since 2003
I had Burger King for breakfast, then KFC
And I'm fat now
Thanks Obama
I'm sure you've dealt with some similar things
I cashed my check Friday, I'm bimpin' again
I bought weed, beer and some video games
And I'm broke by Saturday, thanks Obama
I'm at the bar spending all of my cash
Getting wasted like a burger in the trash
Hopped in my car all drunk and then crashed
I don't have State Farm, thanks Obama
I get distracted when I'm driving in the street
Riding with my knee, Facebookin', not lookin'
I killed a pedestrian, knocked a box truck crooked
These handcuffs hurt, thanks Obama

[Hook - (Lyle & Phil Divinsky) & Spose:]
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
29 living out my momma's bank account, no comma, yelling "Thanks Obama"
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
2PM and I'm still in my pajamas, only friend is this iguana, thanks Obama

[Interlude: Barack Obama]
Don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox

[Verse 2 - Spose:]
Man I should be a rap star, it ain't up for debate
But I'm never working on music, always taking a break
And I don't get why I'm not as famous as Drake
I have twelve followers, thanks Obama
I'm pissed like a catheter
I drank every night in college and I never got my bachelors
So now I'm thirty flipping spatulas and smoking bowls up in the back of Acuras with Ted
Thanks Obama
I'm always doing what I got to do
Like last week, when I banged a prostitute
With no condom, now I'm in the hospital
The doctor says it's gonorrhea
Thanks Obama
I didn't take the trash out last week
My house smells like a homeless man's ass cheeks
I was busy smoking crack out of this glass piece
While my kids cried
Thanks Obama

[Hook - (Lyle & Phil Divinsky) & Spose:]
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
29 living out my momma's bank account, no comma, yelling "Thanks Obama"
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
6PM and I'm still in my pajamas, hanging out with this iguana, thanks Obama

[Interlude -  Barack Obama & (Spose):]
I have something important to discuss with you
(Thanks for nothing's more like it)
Responsibility

[Bridge - Spose:]
It can't be my fault I made my life suck so much
Tweeted something racist and lost my job cause someone showed my boss
Thanks Barack
Now I'm homeless, selling handjobs for five bucks
You know the reason for all of my drama, it starts with an 'O' and it ends with a 'Bama'

[Hook - (Lyle & Phil Divinsky) & Spose:]
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
29 living out my momma's bank account, no comma, yelling "Thanks Obama"
(My downfall, it ain't my fault)
10PM, having sex with my iguana, got caught with my mama, thanks Obama

[Interlude - Barack Obama & (Spose):]
Whenever I'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and she'd say, "This is no picnic for me either, buster"
(Pshh, yeah right)
This is no picnic for me either, buster
(Thanks Obama)

[Outro - Spose:]
What was the other dude's name? Who um, uh, the Mormon dude
Shoulda voted for the fucking Mormon dude, dude, he totally would have let you have sex with the iguana
