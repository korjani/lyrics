This is the greatest shit ever
You get shit from me like

Last night I got so drunk, the homies came over
And I woke up and I didn't have a hangover
Everything was all good, man, I checked my vital signs
I checked my bank account and that shit didn't have a minus sign
Bro, you won't believe this shit
My check engine light was off up in the whip
And I turned on the TV and I caught a sound bite
It's good news, Ray Rice and Chris Brown died
The sun shining got me warm like a lap dance
Started making music, four track TASCAM
My neighbor told me my shit turned him to a rap fan
And that fucking raccoon isn't in my trash can
Usually the lines a hundred and eight
But we went out to breakfast and there wasn't a wait
It got me feeling like today, it couldn't go better
I'm back, can't front, this the greatest shit ever

[Hook:]
See, I'm usually broke but today, man, I just got paid
You couldn't kill my vibe if you tried, man, there ain't no way
I got some beers in the fridge plus a little money in my jeans
I got a call from Rihanna and she told me that she wants my D

No red lights as I'm whipping down to Walgreens
Kinda like the nuggets in my satchel, they were all green (green light)
Got me feeling like I could go do a backflip
Plus I saw a white cop just hugged a black kid
Windows rolled down, radio the sound on
Heard my song get played like plaid pronounced wrong
Check my mailbox, flip through the envelopes
And then there was no bills, like it's bye week in Buffalo
I could get to know this life
Dropped my new video and it got no dislikes
And nobody called anyone a faggot in the commentary
Complaints, I got none, like I'm a monastery
Feeling like it's DYD, I might just let my nuts hang
Got my trash out right before the truck came
No mosquitoes when I'm sitting on the lawn
Avery Bradley getting winner on LeBron

[Hook:]
See, I'm usually broke but today, man, I just got paid (it's the greatest shit)
You couldn't kill my vibe if you tried, bitch, there ain't no way (it's the greatest shit ever)
I got some beers in the fridge plus a little money in my jeans (it's the greatest shit)
I got a call from your mom and she told me that she wish she had me (it's the greatest shit ever)

It's the greatest shit ever
It's the greatest shit ever
I'm the shit, shit, shit ever
I'm the greatest shit ever

Today it's like seventy and yesterday was cold out
My Gmail said tomorrow's show sold out
I called my girl told her I'll be late getting back
She told me keep killing it she wasn't mad
But real, you won't believe this now
See, I went to Dunkin Donuts, got the me discount
I didn't have to even use a Abe Lincoln at the interchange
She told me, "Nah, that shit's free for the King of Maine"
I got to back to where I habitate
She was sipping on a cabernet
She removed her sweater, but wait, it gets better
It's the greatest shit ever
