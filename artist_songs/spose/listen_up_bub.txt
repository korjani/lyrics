I would've never made it here if the fear took hold
"I will not lose" was my yearbook quote
Shout out to Hov, Hov, I haven't yet fulfilled the prophecy
I still put out more than I get back in reciprocity
But I'm not afraid to risk, regardless what it cost me
I'm accustomed to these tall ass risks
Compact discs, set fire to a contract quick
Butt showered, head shaggy like "Boombastic"
Every day I try to leave this mark unremovable
'Cause I'd rather fry than be alive inside a cubicle
I watch the kids till five, then I hit the studio
Looking like I died, made it into something beautiful
A lot of losses I might not have enjoyed
But I learned to say no, learned what to avoid, still self-employed

Listen up bub, everybody tryin' to win
Listen up bub, fall down, then fall down again
Listen up bub, get up, 'cause I won't lose
If I do, that's up to me to choose, I plan to win
So listen up bub, if it comes easy, it don't last
Listen up bub, give up to get some back
Listen up bub, we all got fears and doubts
But you're the only who picks how you turned out
So turn it out

Quitting for me is illegal
I could pretend I always win, but that'd be deceitful
'Cause by now I figured me and Jay Z'd be equals
But I just played Iowa City for three people in the snow
I called my wife after the show
She said, "How did it go?" I said, "You don't wanna know"
She watched the kids as I hit Chicago
The next night, almost every ticket sold
They was singing every note, quote unquote for the P. Dank bro
I bounced back like I wear a sumo suit
'Cause getting too high off my highs
And too low off my lows, that's what you don't do
This work here's my therapy, words full of kerosene
Never scared me, apparently, to risk my kids' food
On my own dreams with no guarantee that I'll ever get it back
I always get it back, bro you better

Listen up bub, everybody tryin' to win
Listen up bub, fall down, then fall down again
Listen up bub, get up, 'cause I won't lose
If I do, that's up to me to choose, I plan to win
So listen up bub, like a broken table, I won't fold
Listen up bub, shit man, I been down that road
Listen up bub, we all got fears and doubts
But you're the only who picks how you turned out
So turn it out

My aim at stars, map made of scars
I drew this treasure map out of my losses
I'm tryin' to be Steve Jobs
But if I only end up as Steve Austin, that'd be awesome
It's not all pleasure, no painless days
At school they teach you not to play the game this way
But I think you're getting played if you're playing it safe
'Cause I got no ceilings like that Lil Wayne mixtape
I'll make a billion, nah, fuck that, I'll make a trillion
If not, I'll make a million, man, I put that on my children
You want a foot in the door? I wanna own the building
It's a cold world, man, you better stop chilling
Go through the dark, come to the light
If your life sucks, stop sucking at life
My heart rate go bump in the night
'Cause I still can't give up the fight, sleep tight

Listen up bub, everybody tryin' to win
Listen up bub, fall down, then fall down again
Listen up bub, get up, 'cause I won't lose
If I do, that's up to me to choose, I plan to win
So listen up bub, just a kid from the sticks
Listen up bub, learn how to stick to the script
Listen up bub, these roots didn't sway in the wind
I've been the same since I begin, begun, whatever
I turned it out
