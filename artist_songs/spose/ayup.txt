P. Dank!

Ayup!
Spizzy still rap real life
It's no wonder that my middle name's Mike, everybody
Ayup!
Became the king of my circumference
I crossed it off my bucket list
If you with me, yell it
Ayup!
Let's see who goes harder
Oh, I won, you lost like my phone charger, yelling
Ayup!
You talk, shit's cute
I act, I don't talk, kinda like I hit mute

I spit it heavy concentration, no constipation when making things
Heady congregation, my observations on 808s
Dead in confrontations with competition to say my name
Every compilation a conversation with state of Maine
I soon nail it, the dudes comin', my peers sayin'
The loon wailin', the moose runnin', the deer grazin'
Got two stomachs, I'm too hungry, don't fear Satan
I'm proof of it, you can make it, I'm here, Jacob
Texts grounded when I write on a flight
You're perplexed, what? You don't expect a fighter to fight?
I'm blessin' every session, catch 'em with the pipe or the mic
The incandecent profession, I'm like the light of their life
Ayup
The merch slinger, the people's rapper, the baby raiser
The beat creator, the show stealer, the liberator
The Maine man, the woods dweller, the innovator
Tomater soup in a world cold as refrigerator
Rhymes out the ass, time out, you're wack
I'm 'bout to snap, a gentleman but never gentle bars
I got mental scars, I seen some shit, I need to spit
Siamese the grip, they play my track then bring it back like rental cars
Airhorn when I came out my mom
Cruised for the green since I was twelve like Tom
Since I opened the rhythm, been jokin' with 'em
Smoking with 'em, spoken in local colloquialisms, it's

Ayup!
Spizzy still rap real life
It's no wonder that my middle name's Mike, everybody
Ayup!
Became the king of my circumference
I crossed it off my bucket list
If you with me, yell it
Ayup!
Let's see who goes harder
Oh, I won, you lost like my phone charger, yelling
Ayup!
You talk, shit's cute
I act, I don't talk, kinda like I hit mute

I get to rock till I sweat thru socks, dog, I'm on my 2nd pair
I'm from the woods, it's all good like it was Becky's hair
The beat slapped the record player, need its neck repaired
Some flows I stroke so fast, beat Katie Ledecky there
I'm taking the rules and restrictions and lighting  and burning 'em down, earning the [?]
Took what I made up in college and made it my permanent sound, swervin' around
Fuck anybody who said that they could [?] a frown, turn it around
I didn't know that my pension could turn into working the sound, burning an ounce
Whoo! I'm lurking urgently, fervently
Till I'm buried in dirt or in gurneys hurried to infirmaries
Spitting perfectly, verses for all my worker bees
Mental as sharp as surgeries, body reverse of Hercules
Peter Sparker picked a pencil, made a classic
The people's politician, pockets profit from my practice
Proper propaganda, never panderin' or plastic
You puff it, better pass it, sing the hook, I'll hit it

Ayup!
Spizzy still rap real life
It's no wonder that my middle name's Mike, everybody
Ayup!

I crossed it off my bucket list

Ayup!
Let's see who goes harder
Oh, I won, you lost like my phone charger, yelling
Ayup!
You talk, shit's cute
I act, I don't talk, kinda like I hit mute

I been blessed to digest success, I had a taste of it
To rhyming I'm religious, but religion I'm an atheist
Thank God my day dream turned day job, I'm gracious
They calling me, want anemology of my alias
Peers scuffuled, careers muffled, it's like it's vader saint
King of pawns, put my blinker on, you said to stay in lane
My syllabus of syllables is malleable as baby brain
Unflapable man, fallible plan, play the game
P. Dank ranked top to make bank
Ock, Shane, Cam came to shame lames, we stopped playin'
Banter full of candor in the winter where it's simpler
When it's icy, we get spicy, we emit hot flames
Ayup!
Spizzy still spill quills
From dawn to dusk, from peon to Elon Musk
I'm bold, behold my trajectory until the death of me
Hard work my secret recipe, right and left of me, yelling

Ayup!
Spizzy still rap real life
It's no wonder that my middle name's Mike, everybody
Ayup!

I crossed it off my bucket list
If you with me, yell it
