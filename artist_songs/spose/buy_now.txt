Buy now, limited time only
But it secretly ends with a "a" like bologna
Side effects include cyborg obedience
To eat every spoonful of lies they been feeding him
Long term concerns: all of my kids
Even if it take gas masks and moving off the grid
In the immediate, it might get tedious
Dealing with some idiots when I been so collegiate
I'm not intermediate, I beg your pardon
But I saw a three year old die from a car bomb
So I change the channel, grab a beer and a large bong
Entered 2-0-1-7 in the starlog
No money down, you'll just be in debt
That's how they keep you silent like the "b" in debt
Broke people voiceless
Money talks and it's making all of these noises
Marking 'em down and moving 'em out
Sounds like what the Nazis did in Poland at Ausch
Wits about me like my autobiography
You'll never make it to the top, you ought to try lottery[?]
I'm a pro, you're a con, that's the dichotomy
And I don't like your company, we got no comradery
Disease set in like suns on horizons
But if you got the symptoms, peep the advertisement
What's genuine and what's advertisin'?

These deals won't last long
Get loans for that ass when the cash gone
And if you die, don't worry if it's passed on
Your kids'll pay it, better write another rap song
Get nailed or hammer the beat
Collect all of the deceased commander-in-chiefs
And bring some candles and some Campbell's to eat
Donald 'bout to drop a nuke and spit a slanderish speech
I'm not demanding a suite, I'm the man in the street
Obey your thirst, drink this product, it'll damage your teeth
But don't worry 'cause we also sell toothpaste
Insurance rates going up on a Tuesday
Here's another ad with the gecko
Pay him every month, get his pockets looking prego
You gon' do it till you're ruined like Aleppo
You got full coverage, but he knows you wanna settle
Here's a new fresh victim with the slate clean
Let's break dreams, drown him in debt by eighteen
And as he's still suffocatin' in the portrait
Let's sell him a house 'cause we know he can't afford it
Ooh, that's gorgeous! I know his worries seem enormous
So run the ad for the 2019 Taurus
Make sure that he defaults on the mortgage
We don't teach finance in high school on purpose
That's perfect
That's how they keep you silent like the "b" in debt

Did you take your pop?
No
Daddy, you are my, um, I will need a assistant
Daddy, ok, ok, assistant, let's get started making designs
Yay, ok
Let's make [?] designs
Daddy, huh?

One of a kind, very custom
