[Spose:]
It's the King of Maine
But I remember getting in the game
Everybody told me I'm insane
"He should stay in college, quit the rappin'
Save a dollar, it won't happen"
They gave up and they told me to do the same
But I knew I was gonna bang
Knew I was emoji with the flames
Even when your homie told me I was lame
Now he wants a verse
Bro, twenty million out the purse
In my Gmail, replied on the plane
Now I bag work, I don't mean coke I mean merch
Twenty-five dollars for a shirt
Since I pay six that's nineteen, profit for a hit
I'm a prophet to these kids, I'm like a church, Speezus Christ
Used to work morning to the night
So another man could live a better life
Minimally pay me then he's whipping a Mercedes
Something shady, so I made it to the majors out of spite
That's right

[Spose & Shang-High:]
You doubted, you doubted
Can't do shit about it, I'm 'bout it
They told me, "Keep quiet, don't try it, just be Ryan"
But I told 'em, "I'm shouting"
Feeling like, "Haaaan," the way I went solo
Check me out, no 'nother man's logo on my polo
Ooh, did it all on my own now
Tried to put me in the box, but I broke out
I feel like a living legend in my hometown
No other man's logo, got no other man's logo on my polo

[Spose:]
Thirty-five hunnid for the show
That's the number right before I blow
Me, I used to work for ten fifty in the kitchen
Boss bitchin' in my vision 'cause there wrinkles in my clothes
Now I write the checks, I don't know what city up next
If you think I'm bimpin' you would be correct
I got fans to my left and some money to my right
I made what you made in a month in one night
Now I'm walking in New Orleans with my homies
And I'm tanning on my shoulder blades
This is what you couldn't see in older days
When I was bumping Odelay
Till I got a whip with a roof that could fold away
Or secret service jogging by my motor cave
If I had listened
My trophies and plaques in the glass wouldn't glisten
I had premonitions but they were dismissive
Thought I was lost, but now boss my description
And if I had listened to you, I'd probably still have the apron
That goes around back and then ties in the front
I quit my job, I'm my boss
I can do what I want, so just pass me the blunt

[Spose & Shang-High:]

[Spose:]
I don't split a dollar with a person
P. Dank Records on the jersey
'Cause the power of my mind make a hour of my time worth more
Motherfuckers can't afford me
You could do this too
I was just like you
One-two-zero-seven
But I been waking up and tryin' to get it
'Cause I never wanna go back to my old job
I'm not complacent, pacin', waitin' for a phone call
They didn't see it, so I guess I had to show y'all
Bro, my whole circle cold like a snow ball
It's the P. Dank clan, that's me, Jay, Cam
Mike Be, Shane and Essence
[?] repossession, check the replay cam
If you doubt us, this is payback
Middle finger to a name tag

[Shang-High:]
