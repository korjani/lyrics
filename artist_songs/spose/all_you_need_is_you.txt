Man, I been independent, not pretendin'
Not dependent on your friendship
Or connection, I'm the only one I need
I used to think I really needed managers
I don't need no assistants
I'm persistent plus consistent, you're resistant
Bro, you must be out your mind, ho
Seven years independent now, where the fuck did the time go?
Chasing cheese, these mice
They can't see me, take off your blindfold
They act like they don't feel me
Touch my texture, want my net worth
Wanna network, I don't need you, I'm an expert
Last week, I met this girl outside of SuperCuts
Said she went to my high school
And she wants to make it at music stuff
She said, "I wanna do what you do, Spiz
I wanna make my dreams come true
But I don't got a deal on the table from a label"
I said, "You don't need a label, are you kidding me?..."

[Spose, Spose & J Spin:]
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
To make your dreams come true
You don't need no fucking crew
All you need is...

[Cam Groves:]
Self-reliance, you should try it
A true survivor on some Do or Die shit
No hand-outs, no crucifyin'
Against all odds like a rooster flyin'
I'm moving by and you fading back
Figured out my own way to rap
Record a verse then play it back
Put it out and get paid a stack
Like every boss I've had, man, I couldn't help avoid
Like my mental health, destroyed
This is why I'm self-employed
There's a fine line between a proposition and a ploy
I don't plan on stoppin' till my opposition is destroyed
Man, I'm in D like semen, even in dreams, I'm schemin'
I stay ten feet for a reason, even friends be deceivin'
Yo, my pen be prestigious, so that envy, I don't need it
I got plenty of genius while you empty and depleted
I don't need no one to tell me how to do my thang
Fuck it, I'ma stop rapping and I'll try to sing
I don't need no one to tell me what the fuck to do
I'ma keep it true so, all you, all you, all you need is...

[Spose & J Spin:]
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
Nobody but myself, no, no, no
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
Need nobody else, have nobody else
I said all you need is...

[Spose:]
The person your mom made
To take a big leap, lil sleep, work long days
All you need is balls to go out and risk it all
If you want the money tall, wanna blow like Pompeii
Other people put the "lyin'" in "relyin'"
I'm relyin' on compliant Ryan drivin' on a wrong way
Tryna get it in like a prom date
Tryna make my pockets go from concave to Ariana Grande
All you need is all you got, I'm all I got, got bigger plans
My life is in my hands, damn, I need some bigger hands
It's out of Maine, this doubted train, I think I can, I think I can
My ink and pen made simple, man, feel Jigga man
You think I can't, bro, think again
Bring 'em in, gentlemen, simpletons, invalids
You wouldn't risk it? (Cash)
I know you wanna be it but you probably didn't see it
It was too far, your vision in the distance (Too far)
You might gotta lose your job (Job)
You might gotta lose some friends (Life)
You might gotta lose and then lose and then lose
And then lose and then lose again to win
I used to work with this rapper at the hardware store
One of the best MCs I've ever heard, this dude was raw
Told me that his cousin knew an A&R at a label
Who was gonna get him into meetings
I said, "Damn, that's cool
Even it falls through, you can still make do..."

Because all you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
If you really wanna get up with that one you can't get rid of
All you need is...

[J Spin:]
We independent, that's my fetish, I don't ask for much
I turn my lessons to a message through this rapping stuff
I spend my mornings cooking breakfast while I'm ashin' blunts
They used to call me borin' till they saw my money addin' up
I won't ever need no re-do, all these people see through
I be the youngest in my class but you should let me teach you
Oh, you wanna do what he do, well there's nothin' stoppin' it
Watch your step, see how far I get, swear all I had was common sense
And I ain't really that big, so you might not know me yet
Might fuck around and get rich, write flows down with my pen
These nights I never sleep through, I'ma make my dreams true
And everything I say always has a ring to it
These people playing, they say they my friends
I swear they all of 'em basic, see the face through my lens
You thought that I was a complacent, that's just a stupid guess
And even when it's raining, I ain't never feeling stressed

[Spose:]
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
All you need is you
I said all you need is...
