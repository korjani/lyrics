You start looking around, hearts racing, hands shaking, minds racing
Happens to the best of us. After all, there's a lot to be worried about these days
Earthquakes, tsunamis, Russians, ISIS, North Korea, ebola, riots, cops, black people, white people, Mexicans, communists, gays, Jews, not having enough followers, not having enough likes, not having enough stuff
But if fear's not you down, I've got just the thing for you:
