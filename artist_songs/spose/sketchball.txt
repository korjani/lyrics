[Intro:]
This one goes out to all the creepers
This one's for you creepers
From fuckin' Spose (Spose!)

Wells, Maine in the house

[Verse 1:]
Look it is alright if you're sucking at life
And you're looking like death
Smelling like Bud Light buddy it is alright
If you've never done a wholesome thing
And you're wallet's still as skinny as an Olsen twin
Just know, you can go low and recover
Even Jay-Z sold crack to his mother
Even babies that were born in poverty
Could win the lottery I mean shit look at me
I'm the dope mic muckler blunt smoke suckler
Kick snare high head smotherer
And the fact is I used to have glasses and braces
And even if I still did I would have passion to
Take it up higher than Balloon Boy fired unemployed
I worked a bunch of jobs that I didn't enjoy
But did I stay down? No
I was way down no
Now I'm up like coke heads at sunrise

[Hook:]
So you've been a sketchball? (sketchball) A douche bag? (douche bag)
It's never to late to get your groove back
So here's a news flash (news flash) a true fact (true fact)
Tomorrow's a new day you knew that
It is alright if you're sucking at life
And you lost your keys and phone last night
It is alright if you've done it all wrong
Cause you could get it right by the end of this song

[Verse 2:]
Hey, stop sniffing the white put your hands up
Stop beating your wife and put your hands up
Stop treating your offspring like Kate Gosling
And bounce with me 'til you're fucking exhausted
Come on
Walk a mile in my Nike sp's
You can see that I used to be an ass wipe
I spent cash on weed that I really did need
I was bummin' when I saw the fucking gas light
But it's true very few get their life cleaned up
You can see a sex offender in an ice cream truck
But you can change from being rapist D
To being educated maybe with a great degree
With a life and a wife and a dog and a job in masonry
And you don't gotta wait to be great so impatiently
Man you can change now just don't aim down
Step your game up
There's hope if you're still breathing even

[Hook:]
If you've been a sketchball (sketchball) A douche bag? (douche bag)
It's never to late to get your groove back
So here's a news flash (news flash) a true fact (true fact)
Tomorrow's a new day you knew that
It is alright if you're sucking at life
And you lost your keys and phone last night
It is alright if you've done it all wrong
Cause you could get it right, everybody sing along

Come on

[Verse 3:]
Look lady if you're trying to lose weight maybe you should put the donut down (donut down)
Lookie here dude you're 33 maybe you should be the grown up now (a grown up now)
Don't you see things could be lovely
If you're Kevin Federline don't buy munchies
If you're Tiger Woods stop getting lucky
Shit, if you're Micheal Vick don't buy a puppy
If you're pitiful
You should stop sniffling
It will be difficult
But it can be different
You can transform from your troubles triplin'
To stacking paper Dunder Mifflin

[Hook:]
Even if you've been a sketchball (sketchball) A douche bag? (douche bag)
It's never to late to get your groove back
So here's a news flash (news flash) a true fact (true fact)
Tomorrow's a new day you knew that
It is alright if you're sucking at life
And you lost your keys and phone last night
It is alright if you've done it all wrong
Cause you could get it right, all the children sing along

[Hook:]
Even if you've been a sketchball (sketchball) A douche bag? (douche bag)
It's never to late to get your groove back
So here's a news flash (news flash) a true fact (true fact)
Tomorrow's a new day you knew that
It is alright if you're sucking at life
And you lost your keys and phone last night
It is alright if you've done it all wrong
Cause you could get it right, go home and rip bongs
I'm gone
