[Verse 1 - Spose:]
You should see these Nike SB’s that I copped online
I turned the AC on then I wrote a hot rhyme
The girl who made my sneakers sobbin’ all the time
Indonesian sweatshop makin’ pennies and she’s nine
I took a clean towel out the closet
Showered half an hour took a sip up out the faucet
A mother in Nigeria, I wouldn’t wanna be ya
No clean water, so her daughter died of diarrhea
I typed a post about my government, was critical
And they didn’t arrest me even though it sounded liberal
In Russia, punishment for that isn’t reciprocal
You question ‘bout the man, then your lifespan’s minimal
When I was six, my biggest worry if I can reminisce
Was that I’d have a Super Nintendo but not a Genesis
Six year old in Rwanda blood what he’s wearin’
They cut his arm off when he wouldn’t kill his parents
I made babies out of wedlock
I read Ladybug Girl then get stoned in the basement by the bedrock
She defied arranged marriage, her betrayed parents
Stoned her to death on the terrace with the cleric
I took a bite of pizza told them, “Give the chef my accolades”
I eat a couple slices then I threw the other half away
A child stomach squealing, begging, he ain’t eat in days
He collapsed with a thud, sounded like a 808
I don’t go to church or the mosque, or the synagogue
If there is a God, he isn’t in my thoughts
A Kurd didn’t fit their definition of religion
Got beheaded in front of his children who lay in prison
I saw a tweet a girl wrote
It said, “I hate school, I’d rather skip it, party, take body shots, and break rules”
School girl got her body shot by the Taliban
Women die to be educated out in Pakistan

[Hook - Renee Coolbrith:]
If I know how it’s goin’ down
Why am I so happy now?
I don’t know

[Verse 2 - Spose:]
I just filmed a video with Bosch
He just bought a drone, flew over a soccer game, we looked at it, looked fuckin’ dope
Iraqi kids playin’ soccer live a humble home life
Mom screams as they got killed by a drone strike
Although neither represent my section
I voted the lesser of two evils in the last election
Some countries only got one candidate
Question them and you can pick which limb they’re gonna amputate
I got police protecting my township
Dial up the number, Crown Vic, come around quick
In Mexico, cops crooked east of Buena Vista
Juan had to join the cartel just to protect his sister
I love my daughter and the smile on her face
I told her she gotta be thirty-five before she start to date
Syrian girls abducted by the caliphate
They’re fourteen, sold as sex slaves in the Islamic state
I feel so alive bumpin’ dead rappers
Life could be like lice, it’s a head scratcher
“Why am I so happy?”, I don’t gotta answer that
“Why are you so miserable?” Is the question that I need to ask

[Hook - Renee Coolbrith:]
If I know how it’s goin’ down
Why am I so happy now?
I don’t know
