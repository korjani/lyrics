When you stay out and your chopper stay focused
She gone be the best
Do what you can when your team get a chance
Put it all to the test
Came for it all, know you heard this before but
I don't more less
Grindin', you fall now you done with the tour
Get it all off your chest
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
When you go hard
You go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I just wanna pull up with my trunk in the front
I just wanna pull up with my niggas smokin' joints
I just wanna pull up with a bitch with no Instagram
I just wanna pull up to the club just to start
When you a young nigga, you can have anything you want
When you a young nigga, you can have any bitch you want
When you a young nigga, you can drive what you wanna drive
When you a young nigga, you can buy what you wanna buy
Havin' fun with some bitches, smokin' weed in the ride
On the corner with my dogs, drinkin' gin to survive
Ain't from the bottom? You can't understand
Bank in my hand, your bitch think I'm the man
Guess I am

All my pockets overweight
Appetite for all this cake
Money man, I still run this game
I'm in perfect shape
Moonrocks, keep me high as tube socks, bird one
Keep it pimpin' and pay close attention, you might learn somethin'
My family is all I need, I make sure that we gon' eat
Overtime, 25 hours, 8 days a week
I remember back when I was broke, how could I forget?
Nine bathrooms in my crib, I got a pot to piss
My look my momma's face when I bought her a new home
My mom, we finally made it, them hard times is gone
Finally made it legit, ain't no way I'mma quit
Got a cone full of guacamole, let's go get these chips
(Hustlin', hustlin')
All the money coming in so fast you can't resist
(Hustlin', hustlin')
Cause there ain't no such thing as gettin' too rich
(Hustlin', hustlin')
You will never hear me say I don't want no more
(Hustlin', hustlin')
This Juicy J and gettin' to the money is all I know
