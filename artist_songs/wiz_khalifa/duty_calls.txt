{Think you're so cute}

Uh, sometimes I just wanna get high
Not pick up my phone
Not be concerned with the bullshit that's goin' on
Get my paper long
Stack it all up with my bad bitch, who could clear the bong
Maybe hit the booth and make a song
Make sure my money hit the roof before I'm gone
One touch, the roof is in the trunk
No blunts, I'm only rollin' papers when I puff
The sky's the limit
It's time to get it
Multiplyin' them digits
While supplyin' that real shit
Don't get dismissed
Lil' nigga, hit this

Still do what I want
You do what you can
That's why I ride around
Feeling like the man
If you feel the same
Then you understand
They get mad but I still do what I want
Still do what I want
You do what you can
That's why I ride around
Feeling like the man
If you feel the same
Then you understand
They get mad but I still do what I want

Oh, non smokers, please leave the flight
Those not in possession of bomb weed
Are in violation of code 420
And will be removed immediately
Non compliance with the rules is not accepted
And violators will be punished
Thank you niggas
