That shit hard

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled

All my bitches roll, all my bitches smoke
All my niggas ride, all my money comin' from the go
All I do is grind, all I do is shine
All I do is take my time, take my place and never wait in line
Had to get my own, had to leave 'em 'lone
Had to fuck your bitch, had to grow some weed, had to get some dome
Pass another one, I got cash enough for both of us
Always rollin' up, smell that weed, you know it's us
Gang

I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled

[Curren$y:]
3 in the roll, then we lit 3 more, continuous smoke
I don't need yours cause these was rolled 'fore I left the door
Nigga fasho, since 2009, this was the code
We collected and changed the trajectory of the globe
Highed up, sittin' in my '84
The second switch I hit'll make my bad bitch drop it low
I'm out front with the moonroof back
Sparks when the bumper scratch
Better tell 'em that, we done smoked the whole pack
