[DJ Motor Mane:]
We ain't never gon' fall off
We always stand tall in this thing
It's the only way we know, it's go hard, you feel me
Ayo Cap, what up, Ty what up
Raven I see you, Tuki, holla at em man let em know how we do

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Been through so much, feel like I been here before
And I ain't never gave up once, I'll always be back for more
And I done learned so much in the game
Made it so far but I'll never change
Know they waiting for me to fall off, but I'll be back for more

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Told her baby that I'll be back for more
If the head good you know that I'll be back for sure
You and I we been through the most
But you never gave up on me
You stayed by my side, you my ride or die girl
I gave you the keys to the Porsche, gave you the keys to the house
Introduced you to moms, girl
You should have my babies
We should start an empire, we can cuddle by the fire
Dolla getting money now, gotta get money now

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
And Dolla never falling off
Dolla still rep the Gang
Dolla never change up
Woah

And Dolla never falling off
Dolla still rep the Gang
Dolla never change up
Woah

[Wiz Khalifa:]

[Raven Felix:]
I started young, I saw a lot
Never questioned if I wanted this bad enough or not
Coming up I never thought about the top
Now I'm getting closer to it every song I drop
Bumps in the road, still moving
I was taught to keep it pushing till you get through it
Quitting's not an option, what's a boss to a queen
Nah, more like what's a queen to a goddess
That's always been my mind state, got a taste
Now there ain't no going back to the ways when we was unpaid
Unemployed, I never had no other choice
Had responsibilities that I couldn't avoid

I, never imagined that it could happen this fast
Came in the game just turning nothing into something now we counting this cash
And I know the higher up that you get means its harder when you fall down
So we gotta stay up, stay up, we about to have it all now
Got me feeling like I

[Wiz Khalifa:]

[Tuki Carter:]
I wake up on that get I, I push myself to get it
I make that product pack it up and seal it
Pump that volume if you with it
Draw it up and frame it, display it seal it
Stack some bread, [?] Action Jackson got it made like special ed
Some sexting got you vexing, so mad you sent a text
She sent a screenshot back like this nigga losing his mac
Dang, intimidated by money reiterate that he funny
You silly slacker I'm Taylor'd, I milly rock in some gators
I'm ice cold, chilly pimping don't like hoes
A-Town stomping, itty bitty thick, booty bumping, shut up and say something
Make something, instead of hating on creative ways that make haters say negative bullshit
Most because they lost they woman to real niggas
So keep ya hustle on hustle, get the M's up don't struggle
I'm M&M'ing these suckers, you threw back candy in clusters
We move by state to state in these busses, to make our way on these fuckers
You charge the game up while they charge the lame up
Never put yourself down on the same ground that you would walk on
You diss that bitch you get your money and you walk along
You walk along, yea
