[Wiz Khalifa:]
You can't wait too long (Who you know smoke more than the Gang?)
Cause opportunity comes and goes
You can't wait too long (Don't worry I'll wait)
When you get another shot you never know
You can't wait too long (What up Al Pac!)
Got no time for that, no time for that
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no

I ain't waiting for my shot
I'd rather get mine the hard way than take it off the top
I make her do what my car say
I'm skating off the lot, smoking weed in the hallway
I stink of all the pot, think you get out on the squad
But I'm thinking that you not
Run up on me the wrong way and end up getting socked
Ain't worried bout what you gon' get just think of what you got
Telling me I'm a star so I take her to the block
Let her meet all my squad see my place
See all of my cars could win a race
But I'm grown I be on a different pace
Get a shot get a chase, I don't take her out on a dinner date
Want a real nigga mama he's in your face
Watch how I innovate
These bitch ass niggas they been afraid
We ain't just getting started we been a gang
You lil ones ain't in the way, you just a bunch of internet chumps
Tryna be tough, until somebody fuck you up
It's Young Wiz

You can't wait too long
Cause opportunity comes and goes
You can't wait too long
When you get another shot you never know
You can't wait too long
Got no time for that, no time for that
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no

[Al Pac:]
Niggas bullshitting me I'm on a paper chase
On the grind everyday to get this paper straight
I paid my dues, Al Peezy making major moves
Smoking on some KK sipping on my booze
I'm from the bottom, coming straight off the block
Ride around in the Caddy, high from pushing this drop
I'm a take you to the top, still repping for Bigavell
And I'm coming for my spot, still giving you niggas hell
What it is, Al Gotti I'm riding with Young Wiz
Gain Greene, Taylor Gang we give you niggas the biz
The streets love it, Al Pac I make it do what it do
If you niggas need that wave I put you up in the loop
Got your lady in the coupe and she swallowed the whole team
When we pull up to the spot, we murder the whole scene
Hold it down for the town, I'm the menace from uptown
Talk crazy out your mouth, my nigga get barked down

[Wiz Khalifa:]
You can't wait too long
Cause opportunity comes and goes
You can't wait too long
When you get another shot you never know
You can't wait too long
Got no time for that, no time for that
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no

[DJ Motor Mane:]
