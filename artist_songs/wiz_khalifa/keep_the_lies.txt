[DJ Motor Mane:]
Yea keep them lies
We only tell the truth over here
Sosamann, Khalifa the Cap

[Sosamann:]
Girl you fine, I wanna make you mine
But I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time
You can keep them lies, finna smoke and get high
And I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time

Girl you could keep your lies
I'm the shit, I been knowing that since 9
Too legit, you could see it in my eyes
Quit your shit, I don't need your ass around me
With all that bullshit I ain't tryna hear it
Baby girl I'm bout mine, really bout my business
Now I'm on that 93, do you wanna hit this
Tell you all about the time I was cooking dishes
I was so relentless but right now you are vicious
Girl I want the guap, let's count up some Benji's
Then I want some top, we not doing no kissing
Girl I'm dripping sauce

Girl you fine, I wanna make you mine
But I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time
You can keep them lies, finna smoke and get high
And I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I don't what safe is, I be down to take risks
I be on some boss shit, you be on some lame shit
Pull up in that new thing, always in the latest
And I'm with my new thing, she fuck me the greatest
2016 none of my bitches basic
Got me on her iPhone, keep me on her playlist
Getting all this money got me looking like a racist
I be working all night my niggas on that day shift
Got a thing in New York, she gave me the business
These niggas all respect me, they don't do no dissing
Girl I'm tryna fuck you, and I'll do the kissing
Leave that pussy wet every time my name get mentioned
