[Intro - Juicy J:]
Man
What's up man
It's time bruh
They've been waiting on this collab
This goes out to the
All the chick on Snapchat
They love that social media life and shit

[Chorus - Liam Payne:]
All I need is you
See anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you
Anything you want
Anything you open
All I need is you
Anything you want
Anything you want girl
All I see is you
Anything you want

[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]
You my bitch, ain't no time for hoe who can't
Who can't walk in heels, who pussy smell like shit
If I told you tote that strap, you'll pop a lick
Never keep that drama you a real real, real real
I'm standing up like I rock it
I'm ready to blow and I ain't got to cock it
I got you wetter than ever
I'm a do it to ya begging me to stop it
You got the world in your pants
My heart in your hands
Ass softer than some jello
I'm gon knock your boots into stilettos
Have your... singing like Adele, Hello
Room full of chicks bout to line em up
If they go both ways I'm a sign them up
Girl take off them Vickys then take off my suit
Cause all I want is you and all you need is juice

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]
I bring the KK through you can grind it up
Work all day now its time to fuck
Coming up short no they not like us
Can't talk bank they got enough
Drink Bombay til I'm out of touch
Go good she gon fall in love
It's been a long time since she got a nut
We can take our time we ain't got to rush
And nah she don't need no wedding ring
This the shit that we go through everyday
I let her know she can everything
Be a coach I can teach you how to run a play
Ba a boss tell you girls that you want to stay
Take if off when I give it don't run away
Your ex-boyfriend he a throw away
Seen him in the club hating the other day
But all I need is a big bag of weed and
You by my side, girl I know you down to ride
Big cribs got lots of those
Fast cars got lots of those
Khalifa man got lots of hoes
I ain't really thinking about em though

[Chorus]

[Outro - Juicy J & Liam Payne:]
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Smoke me out, smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Smoke me out, smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Smoke me out, smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Shawty want to smoke me out
Smoke me out, smoke me out
All I need is you
