(Fight)
Uh, I'mma tell you that you not my competition
I'mma always win, throw me in and I'm going in
I ain't running, I'mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it, talk about it 'cause I really live it
On them nights on a mission, no fear, no hope in my vision
Don't need no intervention, you ain't down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point 'em out, they all gon' be missing
Wonder why I'm still here act a fool if you met me (act a fool if you met me)
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it's too scary
Plus I'm too legendary, It's what we go hard for
I'm rocking your block, you on top you get knocked off
I'm taking your place yeah, I'll make it my property
Maybe again you probably sold your whole life for me
It's only right for me, annihilate a million, I'm aware of sight
Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness in you only make an appetite
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them
Looking pitiful and their condition it be critical, nothing less than original
Cross me once that's the end of you who's next?
(Finish him!...Get over here!)
