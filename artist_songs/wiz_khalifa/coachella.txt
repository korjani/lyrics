Cardo got wings

Uh, rolling 'em fat, don't roll 'em skinny no more
I'm getting mines, I got plenty of dough
I break it down, I got plenty to smoke
I'm with a dime piece
Stuffing cones
Watching new videos
Watch my digits grow
Now I'm on cause I'm getting low
Spread love, take some weed on the road
Teach my son how to be a boss
Never mind the cost
But never try to spend it if you don't got it
Instead of withdrawals, make deposits
Try to make a profit
Never mind the hate cause where I'm from, we've seen it all
Seen niggas rise, seen niggas fall
Ain't pick up when they get the call
Now they stuck, they look at me different
'Bout my business
Inner circle with winners
Thousand-dollar-dinners
Still smelling like bomb-ass weed soon as we enter
Rolling 'em joints, looking like arms when they've been injured
Flying, show 'em, they all get the picture

I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better

Lucky I don't pull the yellow car out
Niggas talking trees but we smoking better
Homie, I'm a vet
Hope you don't get upset
Cop the new Viper demon and the Hellcat
Now where your muscle cars at?
Come to these broads, give 'em heart attacks
Love my fans, I'll always be they favorite artist
And plus, my team go the hardest
We smoking on it if it's Cali green
Was once the newest nigga on the scene
And now we ten years deep
Roll you a joint, just don't fall asleep
All my niggas eat
All my diamonds speak
Might be out the country, never really out of reach
Tryna get paid several days out the week
And ain't really nothing these lames can do about it
Throwing my gang, they just probably mad cause they girl shouted
I pull the paper planes out, put a couple new diamonds in my chain
Don't know 'bout you, fool, but Imma do my thing
Nigga, this gang

I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better
