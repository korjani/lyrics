Hey baby what are you doing? Oh... well I miss you. But, I'm up right now.
And I just wanna know if you wanna send something through, I really want that dick so bad

She can call up a nigga phone
I'm gone call her over where you stay
It don't really matter what you doin'
It can be the middle of the day
I'mma come over beat her down
We can do it right where you staying
It don't really matter what you doin'
It could be the middle of the day

You gone call me up on the phone
I was rollin' in the studio
I was workin' on a new song
You was on all at the pole
You was back and forth with your friends
I was ridin' round in a Benz
I'mma roll up paper plane
I'mma take it straight to the bank
I'mma come over when I say
I'mma come over when it's done, babe
Get you what you want when you say
Make you run from me cause you're worth it
I be on the phone with your girl
Facetime when you get lonely
Got me catchin' feelin's that's strangers
Call me up when you wanna bone

She can call up a nigga phone
I'm gone call her over where you stay
It don't really matter what you doin'
It can be the middle of the day
I'mma come over beat her down
We can do it right where you staying
It don't really matter what you doin'
It could be the middle of the day

You could be the clothes off
I'mma take my shirt off
I'mma leave my chain on
Fuck you all night long
I'mma do it all night
You gone suck it real light
Shawty you a professional
Fuck you like I never wanna let you go
Never let your man know
Your man he a bozo
This money comin' slow-mo
He ain't gettin' no dough
I'm ridin' in a two door
Fuck you and you want some more
Fuck you on the bed then you on the floor
Fuck you on the shower
Fuck you like you never had this shit before

She can call up a nigga phone
I'm gone call her over where you stay
It don't really matter what you doin'
It can be the middle of the day
I'mma come over beat her down
We can do it right where you staying
It don't really matter what you doin'
It could be the middle of the day

We could do it in the daytime, daytime
Middle of the daytime, daytime
Middle of the daytime, daytime
Middle of the daytime, daytime
Middle of the daytime, daytime
Middle of the daytime, daytime
Take shots in the daytime
Get drunk in the daytime, daytime

Uh that shit was so good, I can't wait to see you again tomorrow.
Like the way that you just had me bent over, like that shit was just too good, fuck...
