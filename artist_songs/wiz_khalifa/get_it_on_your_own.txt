Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else

Uh, I got a lot of live for
Weed, I got a lot to give
I'm tryna find a spot to get and dodging these cops that be trying to watch the kid
It all depends on what the options is
I stay positive but still focused on haters because they all plotting
Ain't trying to say it but they all watching
And I know that I'm they favourite
But I wouldn't be here if I was faking
Fuck all the money they say they making
Don't hit my line if you ain't changing things
Know about the bullshit the paper bringing
In the presence of people I plan on being like
Ain't fucking with you cause we don't think alike, uh

Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else

Been around the world and yeah-yeah-yeah
Been rollin' KK, gettin' everybody high
Smokin' in places I ain't even supposed to but they'll never track
Getting bitches naked like Mardi Gras
We already fried when we walk in the party
That's when the conversation starts
Them cameras all in our faces
We don't care 'bout what they say
Get money, three different places at the same time
Pull up, hop out, no shirt on and skip the line
Niggas, you really be sick of lying
Booking me all these shows like I ain't really sick of flying
All I know is the grind
Rolling the biggest joints, never show up on time
Shorty, we smoke like it ain't a crime
Taylor Gang or you dying

Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
