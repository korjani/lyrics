[Wiz Khalifa:]
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Trynna' be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)

(Oh, you just gon' get on top of me like that?)
Hellcat, they keep askin' what the hell is that
Green and black, rockin' Gucci like I brought it back
Need a pack, put this KK in your bra strap
Always workin', never sleep, no, I don't relax
Niggas sayin' Young Khalifa got the dope raps
Ain't just started gettin' dressed, I'm freshin' on my throwbacks
I let her drive the new whip, I pull out the old scoop
They don't even touch the paper 'cause they old news
Young nigga wanna be like me
Front but he don't even like me
She all up on me like EyeSync
Watch in the color of lightnin'
I got hella paper
Said this goin' down, she fucked me in the elevator

They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)

[Chevy Woods:]
Go ask your chick just how I'm mobbin', she ain't feelin' you (shit)
She talk too much, I told her give this dick an interview (dick)
And she a project bitch so she ain't got no manners
She know what the fuck she want so them hoes can't stand her
She know I'm ballin', I ain't callin', that's your man's job (hello?)
Hands free when she suck it, keep her hands off
She just a thot, I get the top and then I smash off
My chain and watch, they do the wop and that's a dance off (what?)
Look we got pistols too (pistols) 'cause we got issues too (boom)
But she just fuck the stick, she know I'm comin' through
Uh, hold a baby, ain't no runnin' plans
Chopper City on my way, you know just how I'm comin'

[Wiz Khalifa:]
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)
