Cause I be bakin' when I'm waken
Shinin' cause I'm grindin'
Smokin' while I'm drivin'
Diamonds in my timing, bitch
Overflow with smoke
I smell like OJ, when I pull up
Only fuck with OGs, so that's what my clique is full of
Niggas get a 'lil love
Actin' like they're famous
Found out what your name is
Now you think you made it
If you're so fucking hot, my nig'
You should be gettin' paid then
But you ain't selling out
You're just an internet sensation
Got a package coming, every state I stay in
Ain't no writing checks at the bank no more
I just [?]
Rolling up the weed, put the KK in the equation
Let you hit the Marley

It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
And away we go
