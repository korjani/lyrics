[Wiz Khalifa:]
I done smoked weed with the best of them
I got me more money than the rest of them
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em

Weed and some gin, weed and some gin
She wanna fuck me and her friend, me and her friend
Be there once, we'll be there again, be there again
Fuck her once, then seen in a win, all these Benjamins
Got me spendin' cake like a nigga baked it
Stay away from all the hate, I don't do the fake shit
I got more money to make and soon as I make it
I'ma split it with my gang, sorry if you ain't in
Rollin' weed up on the plane, only smokin' papers
Run up on your main bitch, teach her how to take dick
She ain't even say shit, other niggas' basic
I'm on some outer space shit, come and ride my spaceship
Fucked her and she came quick

I done smoked weed with the best of them
I got me more money than the rest of them
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em

[Yo Gotti:]
I'm intact, I can't fuck with you fuckboys
I'm multi, Tiffany my new toy
Just pulled up in a foreign with a foreigner
Your bitch textin' my phone but I'm ignorin' her
I guess it goes down in the DM
Now I'm burnin' head in the PM
Havin' problems in your house, it might be my fault
I just knocked your bitch on a IO Hawk
Fuck a hater, get some money, yeah them my thoughts
Brown bags in the closet, that's my fault
Bitches fuckin' for designer, niggas killin' for attention
Talkin' million dollar shit when they ain't even seen a million
