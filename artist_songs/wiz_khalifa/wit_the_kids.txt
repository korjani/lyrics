I'm here
No way to tell us no, no fear
They try to reach us but they don't know
What you fighting for? What side you on?
Ah if I had my way I'd buy peace and change
If I had my way we'd all spread love, there'd be no hate
Now scream it out one time
I don't want to feel one time
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, yeah
Break the mold to keep your mind clear
[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The real, they don't want us to be it
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The truth, they don't want us to see it

America has accomplished so much in these last few years. Whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the calls of freedom in the world. What we've been able to achieve has been done with your help, with us working together as a nation united

Fuck up out of here
Happiness comes from all this
Most of us ain't gotta care
They'll never understand us
Anybody got a problem, say something
Anytime you got a problem, face 'em
Their parents want to know what is going on here

Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The real, they don't want us to be it
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The truth, they don't want us to see it

So tonight, from our family to yours. From our home to yours, thank you for joining us
