Take a step inside my mind.
As my eyes are open wide.
In my sleep I turn and toss.
To rebuild the heart I lost.

You can tell me what you want.
Fooled me once and love was lost.
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone.

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it.
Cause I don't believe a word you say.

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it.
Cause I don't believe a word you say.
There's a sickness living inside me.
You can spare me all your sympathy.

Take a second of your time.
Realize you're wasting mine.
In the night I lie awake.
Why rebuild a heart that breaks.

You can tell me what you want.
Fooled me once and love was lost.
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone.

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it.
Cause I don't believe a word you say.
There's a sickness living inside me.
You can spare me all your sympathy.

So spare me all your sympathy.

I'm sitting, waiting on the sun to rise.
I know it never will, it comes as no surprise.
So won't you stare into my hollow eyes.
They look so hungry now, it comes as no surprise.

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it.
Cause I don't believe a word you say.
There's a sickness living inside me.
You can spare me all your sympathy.
You can spare me all your sympathy.
