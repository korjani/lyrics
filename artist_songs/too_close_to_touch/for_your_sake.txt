Chemical, dripping dark, dark, out of my soul.
Cynical, with a cry I'm out of control.
You say I'm too far gone.
Dug a hole, and you cut straight down to the bone.
I'll remind you, the night you left me alone.
Today I beg for numb.

Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away.
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away.
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain.

Chemical, dripping dark, dark, down in my veins.
Drifting far, disregard dead thoughts in my brain.
The light escapes my eyes.
Skeptical of the place you're taking me now.
Kill me slow, I remain complacent with how.
I've let you bleed me dry.

Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away.
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away.
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain.

It's on your hands, the blood.
You asked for it, because.
You wanted to take control of a vacant home.
You thought I let you in.
But I never will again.

Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain.
