Take every memory ingrained in me.
Erase it from my thoughts so I can sleep.

I know I need to move on, but it's the last thing that I'm ready to do.
These subtle signs cause angry tides that rip me right in two.
I tell myself that this all will pass.
But it just won't stop and it all adds up, so I'm sure that this will last.

Take every memory ingrained in me.
Erase it from my thoughts so I can sleep.
I'd give anything to feel no pain.
Name your price and take the past away.
Take every memory ingrained in me, in me.

They say I haven't been myself.
But I've lost so much that I love, so that can't help.
I'm sick of trying to tell myself that this all will pass.
But it just won't stop and it all adds up, I'm sure that this will last.

Take every memory ingrained in me.
Erase it from my thoughts so I can sleep.
I'd give anything to feel no pain.
Name your price and take the past away.
Take every memory ingrained in me, in me.

They say I haven't been myself.

This constant sadness is a mix of the things I miss.
Combined with all the hate of things that I can't forget.

Take every memory ingrained in me.
Erase it from my thoughts so I can sleep.

Take every memory ingrained in me.
Erase it from my thoughts so I can sleep.
I'd give anything to feel no pain.
Name your price and take the past away.
Take every memory ingrained in me, in me.

They say I haven't been myself.
