How can you say this was all part of your plan.
Start explaining.
Crafted from hope and hospital beds, she's gone.
And honestly…

You fed a dose of comatose to what I love most.
Death is not a game with the ones I hold close.
She was mine, mine, you can't deny.
Three years is too quick to die.

Take me instead, you only loved, I only consume.
I'm worthless to the world. You're innocent and pure.
God, why didn't you choose me over her?

Tell me she's listening as I search for signs
Of why I'm standing.
Left with this hole, that six feet of dirt can't fill.
So why don't you

Just look me in the eyes. Say it straight to my face.
What type of man takes a girl from her place.
She was mine, mine, you can't deny.
Three years is too quick to die.

Take me instead, you only loved, I only consume.
I'm worthless to the world. You're innocent and pure.
God, why didn't you choose me?
Take me instead, you only loved, I only consume.
I'm worthless to the world. You're innocent and pure.
God, why didn't you choose me over her?

So answer me, how am I supposed to deal with this.
Why did she die, when I'm the one deserving it.
And what the hell am I to tell my little sisters.
To ease their tears when they tell me that they miss her.
And what about my mother and my father.
They lost a child and deep inside they wither.
God, I'd do anything to ease the pain.
That ripped through the chest of my brothers that day.

She was mine, she was mine.
What did we do to make you take her from our lives?
She was mine, she was mine.
Oh God, oh what did we do?

Take me instead, you only loved, I only consume.
I'm worthless to the world. You're innocent and pure.
God, why didn't you choose me?
Take me instead, you only loved, I only consume.
I'm worthless to the world. You're innocent and pure.
God I question your judgment.
You're innocent and pure. I'm worthless to the world.
Tell me why you picked me over her...
