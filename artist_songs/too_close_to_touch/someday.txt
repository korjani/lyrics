It's the way, it's the way that you've always had your thumb on me.
Pushing down to make me feel so empty.
Every sound, every taste. Is soured by the energy you spoil,
While you're drowning in a dream that capsized.

But that doesn't phase you at all. 
The light at the end of the hall,
Is starting to dim while you reach for your life vest and learn how to swim.

Oh someday, I will be something. 
You will be somewhere, that you're just out of reach
Oh someday, I will be somewhere. 
You will need something. But you never believed in me.

Sell the lie, sell the life. I believed you.
Got the hook, you've got the line. Forget the ones you leave behind.
I wait, for answers. No more debating on whether I'm worth the time of day.
A cynic never listens anyway.

But that doesn't phase you at all. 
The light at the end of the hall.
When push comes to shove, think you're so far above, make me doubt what I love.

Oh someday, I will be something. 
You will be somewhere, that you're just out of reach
Oh someday, I will be somewhere. 
You will need something. But you never believed in me.

Oh you never believed, wait and see. Wait and see.

How could you say you cared? 
When all you did was disappear.
We learned our faults. 
And picked ourselves back up, 
Won't let you kill our souls.
Nowhere left to go, and we refuse to fold. 
Oh you wait and see.

Oh someday, I will be something. 
You will be somewhere, that you're just out of reach

Oh someday, I will be something. 
You will be somewhere, that you're just out of reach
Oh someday, I will be somewhere. 
You will need something. But you never believed in me.

Believed in me!
