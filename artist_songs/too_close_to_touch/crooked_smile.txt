You've had your thumb on me too long.
I'm so confused on right from wrong.
You cripple every thought of mine.
The damage leaves me in denial.

Slowly finding the light that you've stolen.
Finally looking to purge all the poison.
Leaving while I can stand.
When you watch me dig out from under your skin.

Don't wait up,
Don't waste your time, you know I'm never coming home.
Feed me lies,
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known.

Simple minded soul of mine,
Waited too long to leave you behind.
Always felt you in my way,
A weightless chain beneath my feet.

Slowly finding the light that you've stolen.
Finally looking to purge all the poison.
Leaving while I can stand.
When you watch me dig out from under your skin.

Don't wait up,
Don't waste your time, you know I'm never coming home.
Feed me lies,
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known.

You lost yourself so long ago.
Waited too long for darkness to take hold.
You hate yourself, I hate you more.
All the anger, I can't seem to let it go.

Won't let you feed me lies.
Won't let you feed me lies.

So watch me dig,
So watch me dig away from this.

Don't wait up,
Don't waste your time, you know I'm never coming home.
Feed me lies,
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known.
Don't wait up,
Don't waste your time, you know I'm never coming home.
Feed me lies,
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known.

Won't let you feed me lies.
Won't let you feed me lies.
