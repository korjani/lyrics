[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We run things round here (round here)
So I suggest you don't come around here (round here)
Boy you know you ain't from round here (round here)
So stand clear (stand clear) and I'ma tell you what it is
This is my block (LAY DOWN) this is my block (LAY DOWN)
This is my block (LAY DOWN) this is my block (LAY DOWN)
Ohhhhhh, we run t'ings round here
Oh-ohhhhh, this my block right here
This is my block (LAY DOWN) this is my block (LAY DOWN)
This is my block (LAY DOWN) this is my block (LAY DOWN)
Ohhhhhh, we run t'ings round here
Oh-ohhhhh, this my block right here

[Bun B]
Well hold it down lil' buddy, pump ya breaks, slow ya roll
Ease back on your throttle, put your plans on hold
I don't care what'cha sellin (sellin) or care what'cha sold
I don't know what they was tellin you or what you been told
This my block, I got it locked down cold (cold)
And all this right here, this is under my control
I could really give a damn 'bout the name on the sign (on the sign)
Cause as far as I'm concerned this is mine (this is mine)
You crossed the line playboy, you might as well
make love to a mirror cause you playin wit yourself (playin wit yourself)
We raise hell (we raise hell) we go hard
Don't make me bring the drama to ya momma front yard
This is my block

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
See you from outta town (town) so you don't know the rules (rules)
Round here homie we don't suffer no fools
We don't play with no kids (kids) unless we done made 'em
We don't talk to police ('lice) unless we done paid 'em
It's a code in these streets (code in these streets) you better learn it
And we don't just give out respect, you gotta earn it (you gotta earn it)
And we don't hustle cause we wanna, cause we have ta
God first, fam next, and all the rest after (the rest after)
We make money not the other way around (round)
So don't you play around (round) or we will lay you down (down)
Comin from P.A. the town (town) the land of the trill
Play your cards right or get yourself, shuffled on the real
This is my block

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
See this is my B-L-O-C-K
My streets and I got 'em on L-O-C-K (C-K)
I walk around with G-L-O-C-K
And I'ma keep it on C-O-C-K, okay
I represent P.A., the West to the East (East)
And you don't want a war, everybody got a piece (got a piece)
You think it's sweet (sweet) until you catch a cavity (a cavity)
And that heat'll make yo' ass defy gravity (gravity)
So do the math (do the math) connect the dots (connect the dots)
See if you wanna do it to yourself or not
Don't get too close (close) cause you might get shot (shot)
Just do yourself a favor, get the fuck up out the spot
This is my block

[Chorus]
