But it's a rocky road (road) and I'm still movin up 
And ain't no movin us, so keep it pushin, get to movin bro (for real) 
You might be new to me but you know I ain't new to ya 
Go ask the white boys, they say he's totally tubular (dude) 
Fuckin bad bitches, rub my dick against their uvula 
Everytime I hit the streets, it's like a fuckin movie bro (damn) 
You know what I do to ya, send gladiators through to ya 
They gon' leave ya chopped up, like they was DJ Screwin ya, hold up

[Verse 3 - Bun B (T-Pain)]
Gangsta than a motherfucker, trill until I D-I-E, fuck these other suckers 
(What's your message to the fakers?) 
They throwin rocks and hidin hands 
It don't really matter, this the dirty South, we ridin man 
(How long you been up on that trill shit?) 
Since the day they made me and from a baby 
Until today they never played me 
(Well, throw your hands up) 
From P.A.T. to your town, ain't no need to slow down 
Baby boy, it's about to go down 

[Chorus 1]
