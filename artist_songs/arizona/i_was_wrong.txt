Oh I can see the doubt in those eyes
Even though you try to hide it
There's not much to figure out
'Cause I know why
And I won't try to fight it, try to fight it

And I'll be the first to tell you
You were right
Oh you were right, oh you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry this time

But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know

Used to be so warm, those days
I try not to remember
I got lost in the storm of my ways
Couldn't pull myself together, self together

And I'll be the first to tell you
You were right
Oh you were right, oh you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry, this time

But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
And I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know

And I'll be the first to tell you
You were right
Oh you were right, oh you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry this time

But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
