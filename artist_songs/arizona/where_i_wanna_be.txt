I build my love like a castle in the sand
And when it comes down, it comes tumbling to the ground
And when she speaks, it's a dangerous fantasy
That sets me free to where I wanna be

She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be

And her hair blows like a lighter in the wind
And I lose my senses baby, it gets under my skin
And when she speaks, she's all I'll ever need
She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be

She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be

I build my love like a castle in the sand
And when it comes down, it comes tumbling to the ground
And when she speaks, it's a dangerous fantasy
That sets me free to where I wanna be

She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be, I wanna be
