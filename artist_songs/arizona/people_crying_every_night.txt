Oh and as the day
Turns into night
The things that we can't say
The things we try to hide
Like everyone else
We can't choose the way we die
Oh but we can choose
The way we live tonight

Oh I wish I had the answers
I wish I had the time
To give you all the reasons
Why it's worth it down the line
Well maybe I don't have the answers
Maybe we could find the time
Because there's people crying
People crying every night

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
People crying every night
There's people crying every night
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
People crying every night
There's people crying every night
Whoa oh whoa oh

Oh it's such a strange
And unforgiving life
And no matter what
No one makes it out alive
So we should spend more time
Wondering why we fight
Instead of hiding love
On the edge of all our knives

Oh I wish I had the answers
I wish I had the time
To give you all the reasons
Why it's worth it down the line
Well maybe I don't have the answers
Maybe we could find the time
Because there's people crying
People crying every night

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
People crying every night
There's people crying every night
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
People crying every night
There's people crying every night
Whoa oh whoa oh
People crying every night
There's people crying every night
Whoa oh whoa oh
