Sometimes our loves an open door
And we know its safe inside
But we have slammed it shut before
And locked our hearts outside
But we get a handle on it
When we let go of our pride

[Chorus]
Sometimes we put words and walls between us
Lose our heads and gamble with our hearts
There've been trials and tears,doubts and fears
Between us
But when all things pass
It's love that'll last between us

Love has taught us to forgive
And time helps us forget
Still as long as we both live
We'll say some things we regret
But love keeps a workin on us
Aw cause we ain't perfect yet

[Repeat Chorus]

There've been trials and tears
Doubts and fears between us
But when all things pass
It's love that'll last between us
