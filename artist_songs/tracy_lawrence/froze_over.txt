She just closed the door
And tonite the heartaches begin
I've lost the key to heaven
And my angel just wont let me in

Well I begged and pleaded down on my knees
To a heart that has turned as cold as ice
She once swore she loved me
Till hell froze over
Well hell just froze over tonite

She said i love you darlin till death do us part
And I said i do too darlin with all of my heart
Hand and hand together, forever, we'd walk side by side
But i took her for granted
Took too many chances, until her love for me died

She just closed the door
And tonite the heartaches begin
I've lost the key to heaven
And my angel just won't let me in

Well i begged and pleaded down on my knees
To a heart that has turned cold as ice
She once swore she loved me till hell froze over
Well hell just froze over tonite

She once swore she loved me till hell froze over
Well hell just froze over tonite
