I've never felt as helpless as I do today
My world just fell around me as I watched you drive away
There's nothing left between us somehow we've grown apart
Cause I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heart
I can't believe this is me on the hurtin' side of pain
Sifting through the ashes still tryin' to find a flame
But the flames have turned to embers left glowing in the dark
Yes I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heart

If I could Lord knows I would spin back the hands of time
And piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my mind
Pick up where we left off and make a brand new start
Cause I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heart
I can't believe this is me...
Oh I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't break it to my heart
