Theres no way i could ever leave her
I'm addicted to her love can't break the tie
A victim of my own need and to far to ever be free
Everything she does I somehow justify

[Chorus]
I'm aprils fool
I play by her rules
She treats me any old way she wants to
Just as sure as clouds bring showers
And springtime brings May flowers
And a mountain breeze blows cool
I'm aprils fool

Many times i've tried to live without her
Like a frightened runaway child, I always return
To the games she loves to play
Where she always gets her way
Although it hurts I never seem to learn

[Repeat Chorus]

Just as sure as clouds bring showers
And springtime brings May flowers
And a mountain breeze blows cool
I'm aprils fool
Aprils fool
