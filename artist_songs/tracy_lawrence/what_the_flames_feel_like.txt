Some take to drinkin'
Some take to usin'
Dont't matter what poison they choose
Some hit rock bottom, lose every dollar
Some get thier hearts broke in two
It's a long way down
And a hard road back

[Chorus:]
When you've been through hell
Played with fire
Watched the devil dance 
You thank the Lord for each morning
For one more second chance
You might outrun your demons
You might get on with your life
But you never forget what the flames feel like

I know temtation is out their waiting
To lure me back into her arms 
But I wont surender 'cause I remember
How her kisses branded my heart
So I walk away 'cause the fire still burns

[Chorus]

If you follow the straight and narrow
I know it might be hard to relate
But if you've been their like I've been their
Your carefull with each step you take 
It's a long way down 
And a hard road back 

[Chorus]
