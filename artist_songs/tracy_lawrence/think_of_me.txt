First year med tech, 2 AM
On the graveyard shift a call comes in
A senseless killin'
Blue lights flashin', white chalk line
I still get queasy but I'll be fine
The good Lord willin'
I searched my heart but I don't have a clue
For the evil that men do

[Chorus:]
So think of me while you're safe at home tonight
Think of me while you hold your loved ones tight
I'm someone you might never need
But before you drift off to sleep
When you pray the Lord a soul to keep
Think of me

Midnight, back of a high school gym
The drug dealers think I'm one of them
Their new connection
Car trunk opens, the deal goes down
The cops take a risk on this side of town
With no protection
My throat goes dry at all that I could lose
If I make one wrong move

[Chorus]

I'm climbing the stairs in a warehouse fire
I'm savin' a child from what's left of a car
Jumpin' out of a chopper so a sailor survives
I'm flyin' a fighter jet up to the stars

I'm someone you might never need
But before you drift off to sleep
When you pray the Lord a soul to keep
Think of me
Think of me
Think of me
