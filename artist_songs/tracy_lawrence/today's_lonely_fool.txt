What would you say if I told you I was sorry 
And that I've come to realize 
Life means nothing without you 
Would you take my hand 
Would you forgive this man 
For ever doubting your love is true 
And could you find it in your heart 
To let me try and make it up to you 

Yesterday a jealous man 
Today a lonely fool 
I let love slip right through my hands 
With all the hurt I've handed you 
I've gotta stop your love from dying 
Or I'll be living proof 
That yesterday's jealous man 
Is today's lonely fool 

Darlin' from now on 
I'll be proud when other men notice you 
Instead of gettin' mean and loud 
Like I used to do 
Find some mercy in your heart 
And we'll make another start 
At the love that we once knew 
I won't hurt you anymore 
I'm gonna trust you now and never question you 

Yesterday a jealous man 
Today a lonely fool 
I let love slip right through my hands 
With all the hurt I've handed you 
I've gotta stop your love from dying 
Or I'll be living proof 
That yesterday's jealous man 
Is today's lonely fool 

I'm today's lonely fool
