A little boy on a big jet plane
Taking off in the pouring rain
They're bouncin' round like a basketball
He says Mama what if we fall?
She looks in those big scared eyes
Son think of it like a circus ride
Next thing you know he's laughing out loud
Saying do it again as the wheels touched down
I guess Its all how you look at it
You might see more than the side that your seeing
Turn it upsidedown and shake it up abit
It could be a good thing
Its all how you look at it ya ya
Businessman playing air guitar
He always dreamed he'd be a superstar
Quits his job and starts singing at night
Is he giving up his living or taking back his life?
I guess its all how you look at it
You might see more than the side that your seeing
Turn it upsidedown and shake it up abit
It could be a good thing
Its all how you look at it
You've got your opinions and I've got mine
Can we agree to agree at some of the time ?
A glass half empty is a glass half full
And thats what makes life beautiful
I guess Its all how you look at it
You might see more than the side that your seeing
Turn it upsidedown and shake it up abit
It could be a good thing
Its all how you look at it
Its all how you look at it
You might see more than the side that your seeing
Turn it upsidedown and shake it up abit
It could be a good thing
Its all how you look at it.
