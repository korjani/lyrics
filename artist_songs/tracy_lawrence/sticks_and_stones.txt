You can take the house and everything in it
Keep the diamond ring cause thats how I meant it
Sticks and stones are all they ever were to me
This material life with all it's value
Don't mean a thing to me without you
The love that we once had is all I need
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But darlin let me say before I leave

[Chorus]
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say, we are through
These sticks and stones may break me,
But the words you said just tore my heart in two

Remember when we didn't have a dime between us
You took my hand and said we don't needmuch
Just as long as we're together we would be fine
Now we've acquired all I thought would please you
I gave everything you know that I could
And still you're telling me you're not satisfied
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But darlin let me say before I leave

[Repeat Chorus]

These sticks and stones may break me,
But the words you said just tore my heart in two
