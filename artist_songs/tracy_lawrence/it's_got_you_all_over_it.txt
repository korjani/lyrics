Today my radio played a new love song pretty soon I was singing along
When the chorus came around I knew every word every line was written about you
It's got you all over it like a sweet melody that you can't forget
Reminds me of the love I'm in it's got you all over it
[ fiddle ]
From this ear-to-ear grin on my face to this feeling that makes my heart race
Even in the dreams I dream at night
Well I guess you could say I've got a one-track mind
It's got you all over it...
[ fiddle - steel ]
It's got you all over it...
It's got you all over it...
[ fiddle - steel ]
