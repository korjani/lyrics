As you lie in my arms girl my heart's on my sleeve
Words come so hard in moments like these
There's feelings I have that are so hard to show
But right now there's one thing I want you to know
As long as the tides ebb the earth turns the sun sets I promise I'll always be true
As long as there's stars over Texas darling I'll hang the moon for you

I know I have stumbled and caused you some tears
When you needed me most I haven't always been here
I know I'm not always the man I should be
But don't ever wonder what you mean to me
As long as the tides ebb...
[ mandolin ]
And as long as there's stars over Texas darling I'll hang the moon for you
Darling I'll hang the moon for you
