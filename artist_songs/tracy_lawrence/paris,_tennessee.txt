But I got enuff to cover you and me
I'm taking off wont you come with me honey
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee

I want to show you the riviera
Got new tires and a good cb
Put on some lipstick and your mascara
Cause were going all the way to Paris, Tennessee

Baby I adore you
Dont say I never done nothin for you
That just aint true

Baby, I adore you
Don't say I never done nothin for you
That just ain't true

But I got a cousin that I want you to meet
And he can pick the wildwood flower
Better than anybody down in Paris, Tennessee
