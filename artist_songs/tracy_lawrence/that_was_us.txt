Twenty dollars out of mama's purse bought us a tank of gas
And some Redman tobacco when we was just teenage kids
Yeah me and my old buddy Leroy we'd go driving around
If there was trouble to be found man we dang sure did
Cuttin' doughnuts in the fields till Old Man Smith would call the cops
He'd come running out with a shotgun cause we was running down his crops
And I reckon he's still wondering who that was that was us

Some of these local boys moved on but we never changed a bit
I don't guess we had enough sense least that's what some folks said
Yeah we finally turned old enough to buy our own beer
Don't remember much about that year lucky we ain't dead
Cause somebody said they saw some boys with a truck looked just like mine
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank sits out on the county line
And people wonder why it leans the way it does that was us

Seems like small towns never change but things get tough when times get hard
And they said when he got sick that Old Man Smith would've lost that farm
He was gettin' way behind on all his bills
Till someone came and brought his crops in from the fields
Yeah folks round here still don't know who that was that was us

Cuttin' doughnuts on the fields till Old Man Smith would call the cops
He'd come runnin' out with a shotgun cause we was runnin' down his crops
Somebody said they saw some boys with a truck looked just like mine
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank sits out on the county line
That was us yeah that was us
