We argued over whether I could buy that Chevy
That Silverado sittin' in the drive
She would always give in when we'd fight about religion
Even though Lord knows that she was right
From politics to picture shows and music on the radio
What we could and could not afford
Well I may have won those battles but I still lost the war
Every time we'd disagree and it got down to her and me
It was always me who got his way
Now sittin' here I'm looking back the only thing I see
Is that the time for looking back's a bit too late
And I'm thinking as she's walking out the door
I may have won those battles but I still lost the war

So many times she'd ask me just to meet her halfway
But in my mind there was no compromise
And it kills me to remember all the times when she'd surrender
Never showing me a single tear she cried
And as I watch her walking out I'm left here to figure out
What it was that I was fightin' for
I may have won those battles but I still lost the war
Every time we'd disagree...

Now sittin' here I'm looking back...
I may have won those battles but I just lost the war
