Bobby Darwin's daughter looks up from the bible she's been reading to the clock on her dirty wall of a double wide, its 3 am. Her husbands on the town shooting pool or foolin round, or all of the above it doesn't matter anymore, she can't get through to him, seems like only yesterday they were married in a chapel. Candlelight the whole nine yards, honeymoon in Vegas, they settled down. Now its lonely nights and hungry kids, she just keeps on looking for the life that's not the life she's living now. 

Bobby Darwin's daughter used to ask her father where Santa Clause and babies and God came from, and as she's gotten older all those easy answers are somewhere between here and kingdom come, and in her darkest hours Bobby Darwin's daughter wishes she could go back when, she'd ask where god came from instead of wondering where he's been.

Bobby Darwin's daughter dropping off the kids driving home in the pouring rain sudden skid and just like that she's clinging to her life, her husband rushes in the tiny room and through his tears whispers I love you, baby please don't leave me now, you're my only life, he bows his head and prays aloud this one thing I promise, if I could get just one more chance to be the man I should have been Ill be that man, she awakens to another world, stares into his grateful eyes of love, she smiles at him he takes her hand.
