He takes all this criticism from those who never played the game
No matter how hard they hit him he keeps on playing through the pain
When they lose he takes the blame
Old number nine

[Chorus:]
For the love they live for the love they die
No higher calling in this life
There's nothing they can't rise above
Cause it's not about rich it's not about poor
Counting the cost and keeping score
They do it for the love

I know this cop in Cincinatti
Born into money and prestige
He could be living off of Daddy
But instead he's out there on the beat
Protecting serving you and me
Badge forty fifty seven

[Chorus]

He's in your heart he's your best friend
He won't break no he won't bend
Look around you'll see he's in each of us

[Chorus]

We all do it for the love
