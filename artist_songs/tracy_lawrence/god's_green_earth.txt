I shook off the blame and said some things when I should've bit my tongue
My foolish pride made the knot we tied come undone
I've got more regrets than blades of grass that cover up this dirt
On this big old ball we all call God's Green Earth
Oh your memory has colored me lonely tonight
My eyes are red from the tears I have cried
I'm heartbroke and blue sittin' on a world of hurt
Down here on God's Green Earth
[ fiddle ]
It's a fact if you don't come back can't live without your love
I'll do anything for another drink from that cup
Without you girl it's true I got a powerful thirst
That can't be drowned by all the water found on God's Green Earth
Oh your memory has colored me...
[ steel - guitar ]
Oh your memory has colored me...
I'm heartbroke and blue sittin' on a world of hurt
Down here on God's Green Earth
[ fiddle + banjo ]
