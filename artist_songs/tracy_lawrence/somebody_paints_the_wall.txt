If my old truck was a horse
I'd have to shoot it
Lord the day my ship came in
I was waiting for a train

Everytime I get a grip, I always lose it
I can't find the sunshine for the rain
And you know I'm always saying I'm sorry
But you stand by me through it all

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody paints the wall

Everytime I think I'm off and runnin
I'm barely up to a crawl
Everytime I get a leg up on the ladder of success
I slip and fall

Like last week down at the factory
I was up for a promotion
But the boss says little brother got the call

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody paints the wall

Everytime I think I'm off and runnin
I'm barely up to a crawl

Everytime I get a leg up
On the ladder of success, I slip and fall

Like last week down at the factory
I was up for a promotion
But the boss says little brother got the call

Seems like everytime I make my mark
Somebody paints the wall

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall
