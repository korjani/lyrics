My hands are in my pocket
My pockets are full of change
Enough to buy some bait and gasoline
I head down the road where the road gets smaller
Next thing you know I am way back in a holler.
And my lines in the water 
Where the water runs deep
I cant help but to believe

I know where heaven is. 

[chorus]
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile and
Take a break for a little while
And walk away knowing my soul wont ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven is

Got a fork in the pie
And the pie is homemade
Half the people here has got my last name
I am sitting at a table 
The table is to small
Cuz two new cousins got born last fall
The tire swing is swinging out over the creek
Aint no better place to be

I know where Heaven is

[chorus]
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile
Take a break for a little while 
And walk away knowing my soul wont ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven is. 

I dont need no directions
I dont need no map
I know I am in paradise
Wherever my heart hangs its hat

I know where Heaven is
Look around its hard to miss
Living proof that God exists.

I know where heaven is. 

[chorus]
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile and
Take a break for a little while
And walk away knowing my soul wont ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven 
I know where Heaven 
I know where Heaven is
Yes I Do
