DIE!! 
So now the lights flash white and all you see is anger get up. 
Was your life worth it? 
Were you content? 
Could you make everything feel perfect in your own head? 
But now, after all, can you just forget? 
But now, after all, what do you got to show for it?

To darkness, to suffer when I fall. 
I will see you in hell.
[x2]

DIE!! 
There's no second chance to write away the anger. 
Take it. I felt comfort in this broken glass, we're soaked in ash. 
Would you catch me if I fell, hurting? 
But now, after all, can you just forget? 
But now, after all, what do you got to show for it?

To darkness, to suffer when I fall. 
I will see you in hell.
[x2]

When you're broken, you're beat down. 
See you in hell now, see you in hell now.
[x3]

DIE!! 
So here's my last goodbye, this nightmare ends, you're asleep now, get up. I set my friends on fire. 
I know I've lost control, I see you've lost your smile as this life takes its toll. 
But now, after all, can you just forget? 
But now, after all, what do you got to show for it?

To darkness, to suffer when I fall. 
I will see you in hell.
[x2] 

You won't be there when I fall.
I will see you in hell.

To darkness, to suffer when I fall. 
I will see you in hell.
