The beauty how nights blur.
Look twice tonight and she'll bring the cure,
And this promise to forgive you.
Whoa.
My demons reimburse.
Think hard and tonight we'll break the curse,
And this promise to forget you.
Whoa.

Tonight (tonight). Oh tonight (tonight). Oh tonight (tonight).
I can see through a lifetime of wretched demise.
And these words can hurt me.

We're all in hell.
Laughing in your misery.
The desperate fade to black and it suits me well.

The lonely, the desperate.
Enclosed is the love I've never sent,
And this power to forget you.

Well tonight (tonight). Oh tonight (tonight). Oh tonight (tonight).
I can see through a lifetime of wretched demise.
And these words can hurt me.

We're all in hell.
Laughing in your misery.
The desperate fade to black and it suits me well.

If we fall will we waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?

I know you hurt in this beautiful misery.
So read these words and we'll sing forever waste away.
I know you hurt in this beautiful misery.
So read these words and we'll sing forever waste away.
(Free fall will we waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?
Free fall If will waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?
Free fall will we waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?
Free fall If will waste away?
If we fall will we waste away?)

We're all in hell.
Laughing in your misery.
The desperate fade to black and it suits me well.
