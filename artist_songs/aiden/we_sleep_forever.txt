She walks the line into her deathbed rings
I say she's all alone
And begging for forgiveness
I won't teach her to lie or make a plan
That clairvoyant stare and grin
God won't forgive me
for this I know
tragedy unfolds tonight
As you sever my skin apart
Take this sadness and close your eyes, love

(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) This razor blade was meant for me
(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) We'll mutilate insanity

She cuts the vein although it's much too dull
I say she's all alone
Fighting for redemption
I know a little pain, a little lust
I lose myself at night to feel the rush
of tearing my skin apart
Now take this sadness and close your eyes, love

(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) This razor blade was meant for me
(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) We'll mutilate insanity

Go deeper, I feel it
I see your ghost appear
Go deeper, I see it 
I feel your ghost appear
I will say goodbye tonight 
We'll sleep forever
Hold on, hold on tonight love
We'll sleep forever
Hold on, hold on tonight love
We'll sleep forever
Hold on, hold on tonight love
Close your eyes

(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) This razor blade was meant for me
(Whoa) Hey, call the angels. 
(Whoa-o) We'll mutilate insanity
