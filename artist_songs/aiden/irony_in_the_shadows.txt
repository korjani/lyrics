What if there was no hell,
What if there was no heaven to sell?
What if we were slaves to breed,
What if you drank this cup half fucked?
I’m half relieved
I’m dying to hear you breathe,
Are you dying to take a breath?

Hold on between ugly
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of death
I will fear no life, fear no evil.
You laugh all the way to the bank.

What if you were sold beliefs,
What if abandoned hearts killed earth save luxury?
I’m dying to hear you breathe,
Are you dying to take a breath?

Hold on between ugly
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of death
I will fear no life, fear no evil.
You laugh all the way to the bank.
