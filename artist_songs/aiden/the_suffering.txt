Burn Your Friends

Burn Your Friends
Burn Your Friends

Living is easy
With your eyes closed by and by.
Do you wake up, do you wake up and cry at night?
The evil inside that breaks right through the light,
With hard times and long goodbyes.

Take me into your dark dream 
and scream so loud this place fills with misery
Suffer the kiss
And take me out alive.

We're those things that you despise
(We will sing)
We're the suffering alive

Burn Your Friends
Burn Your Friends
Burn Your Friends
Burn Your Friends

Shadows and hearts
In which to carry your rue aloud
Can you believe we are the shock of existence now?
Something's a miss, and this generation has been found.
We're brought to the underground.

Waste me to your dark dream
And taste me until all I see
A thousand sparks
We fake love futility.
I see the rain.

We're those things that you despise
(We will sing)
We're the suffering alive tonight
(Suffering)
We're those things that you despise 
(We will sing)
We're the suffering alive tonight.

This time we're coming home,
Worthless this time, this time alive.

(We will sing)
We're those things that you despise
(We will sing)
We're the suffering alive tonight
(Suffering)
We're those things that you despise 
(We will sing)
We're the suffering alive tonight.
