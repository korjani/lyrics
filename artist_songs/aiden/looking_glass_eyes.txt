Is seventeen so far away from here?
At twenty-one I live a different life
I never dreamed I could
And as I pick up pieces I can't let go
of that old never-ending nightmare

I remember times when skies were grey
Innocence ran through our bones
you and I had much to say
I know you'll take me home again...

Last night those cops came to arrest you
What'd you do this time? Was is far from home?
Well I've seen you twice in the last ten months
Now you're gone again, so far from home

I remember times when skies were grey
Innocence ran through our bones
you and I had much to say
I know you'll take me home, again...

I have found life, and took the time to 
never fear and sing for death
I'm not a victim, you're not the answer
I can't control my own life
