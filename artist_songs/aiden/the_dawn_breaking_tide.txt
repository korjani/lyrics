Well I have promised not to save you
from this hotel
I have promised not to let you go
Let you go 
[x2]

I can feel the winters air
and we're almost home now
We're almost here
And every turn of the past
Every blink of time
I feel the dawn breaking tide so

Well I have promised not to save you
From this hotel
I have promised not to let you go
Let you go 

Well it's drugs that is breaking us down now
It's mind numbing freight train hears the sound
Give reason to what ties us to our past
And fights for our lives

I can feel death combing through my hair
and breaking tide
I can feel death combing through my hair
and breaking tide

It's not time to give up 
It's not our time to give in 
It's not time to give up
It's our time to give all
(Our Lives)
Depends on the dawn breaking tide
(Our Lives)
Depends on what's wrong and what is right
(Our Lives)
Depends on the dawn breaking tide
(Our Lives)
Depends on what's wrong and what is right

(Our Lives)
Depends on the dawn breaking tide
(Our Lives)
Depends on what's wrong and what is right
