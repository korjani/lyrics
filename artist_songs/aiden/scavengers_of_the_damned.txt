"Well I'm dead! To the world" she said
And the funeral came alive.
I collect every flower sent
From hell down to the fire.

Fall down sick,
I'm not insane.
(Are you feeling gross? Are you full of shame?)
Death has come to set us free.
(Come set me free!)

Oh, it's up to me
To make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
Scavengers of the damned.

We kill, let the demon steal an antique pattern sky.
Well goodbye, to all the lives I stole.
And the funeral came alive

Fall down sick
I'm not insane
(Are you feeling gross? Are you full of shame?)
Death has come to set us free.
(Come set me free!)

Oh, it's up to me
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers
Scavengers of the damned
(We're on a mission to invite you all back to hell)

Oh, it's up to me
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers
Scavengers of the damned
(We're on a mission to invite you all back to hell)

Hey! Hey!
If you want love,
Hey! Hey!
If you crave death.
Hey! Hey!
Invite us, out of the darkness.
[x2]

Oh, it's up to me,
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers,
Scavengers of the damned.

Oh, it's up to me,
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers,
Scavengers of the damned.

Oh, it's up to me,
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers,
Scavengers of the damned.
(We're on a mission to invite you all back to hell)

Oh, it's up to me,
To make you fucking bleed
We are the scavengers,
Scavengers of the damned.
