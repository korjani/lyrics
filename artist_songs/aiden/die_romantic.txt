You can illustrate your life in romance.
But I can show you something so much more than words, 
In my hands.
It's not your best intention now to burn your friends, 
This is your last night, this is your last chance.
In my hands

(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we die complete.
(Die romantic, romantic)
Tonight's the night, and it's all we need now
To die romantic

I sat and watched your heartbeat fade with every breath.
I watched your lips turn blue, your eyes went cold and all, 
with all the rest.
I felt the panic and tried to breathe.
Is this happening?
I've fucking had it.
Well, God, save me, please.
'Cause I don't think she'll make it through the night.

(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we die complete.
(Die romantic, romantic)
Tonight's the night, and it's all we need now
To die romantic

Your last words to me "tonight's the night" meant redemption was only found in books. 
Your last words to me "tonight's the night" meant redemption was harder than it looks. 
So take care of what you love 
and all this stuff are remnants of a life in shattered glass, 
it's all I have to ask.

I (I) miss (miss) you (you)!
I (I) miss (miss) you (you)!

You can illustrate your death in romance.
I can show you something so much more than words, 
In my hands.
I felt the dead-end price you paid for everyday.
This is your last night,
Suicide kept tight,
You're gone tonight.

(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we die complete.
(Die romantic, romantic)
Tonight's the night, and it's all we need now
To die romantic
[x2]

Die romantic, die romantic, die romantic,
Die romantic, die romantic, die romantic, tonight...
