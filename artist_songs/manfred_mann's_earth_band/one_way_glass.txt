Give me a window with one way glass
To look out on the world and watch people pass
Give me a window to shield me
Where I can't be seen, I don't wanna be free

Give me a window to stop the sound
To keep out the noise of the merry-go-round
Give me a window with one way glass
Save me from questions I might have to ask
