You angel you,
You got me under your wing,
And the way you walk and the way you talk,
Feel I could almost sing.

You angel you,
You're as fine as anything's fine,
Though I just walk and I watch you talk,
Your memory's on my mind.

Even though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Well I never did feel this way before,
I never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love then give me more and more and more and more and more.

You angel you,
You're as fine as fine can be,
And the way you walk and the way you talk,
Is the way it ought to be.

You angel you.
Well I never did feel this way before,
I never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love then give me more and more and more and more and more.

You angel you,
You got me under your wing,
And the way you walk and the way you talk,
Feel I could almost sing.

You angel you,
You're as fine as anything's fine,
Though I just walk and I watch you talk,
Your memory's on my mind.

Even though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Well I never did feel this way before,
I never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love then give me more and more.
