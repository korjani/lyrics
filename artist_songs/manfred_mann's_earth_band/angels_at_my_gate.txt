There's a finger on the dial,
The lucky wheel goes round,
Little joker knows he can't escape.
The same time every year,
The fun fair's back in town,
Numbers in the air like ticker tape.

58, 56, 54,
Good angels at my door.
63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58,
Good angels at my gate.

Throw a seven down,
Place another bet,
The joker laughs as the stakes get higher.
The gambler and the clown,
Without a safety net,
Balancing unsteady on a wire.

58, 56, 54,
Good angels at my door.
63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58,
Good angels at my gate.

There's a finger on the dial,
The lucky wheel goes round,
Little joker knows he can't escape.
The same time every year,
The fun fair's back in town,
Numbers in the air like ticker tape.

58, 56, 54,
Good angels at my door.
63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58,
Good angels at my gate.
59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54,
Good angels at my door.
63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58,
Good angels at my gate.
59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, [fading]
