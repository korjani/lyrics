I bring joy and I can take you through
All those days when people seem to get to you
I bring joy and I come here to you I bring life and I can take you where
You can see and feel and breathe and touch the air
I bring life and I can take you there Take your time, remember when you do
There are days when people feel the same as you
I bring time and I can take you through I bring joy and I can take you through
All those days when people seem to get to you
I bring joy and I come here to you
