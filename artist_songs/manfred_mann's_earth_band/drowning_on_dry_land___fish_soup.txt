Sitting in a silent room
The walls around me screaming
Rely on nothing wait on no-one
Standing between light and dark
Watch the mirrors gleaming
Shine on nothing showing no-one

Drowning on dry land
Cast adrift on an empty sea
Drowning on dry land
Put aside with the will to be

Stranded at the break of dawn
And where the story's ending
Tells of nothing hearing no-one
I stand without a word to say
The silent room is empty
Sings of nothing changing no-one

Drowning on dry land
Cast adrift on an empty sea
Drowning on dry land
Put aside with the will to be
