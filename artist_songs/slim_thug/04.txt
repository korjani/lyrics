Thug house band he the king of the city
Everywhere we go we keep a fleet that’s pretty

35 years old and the boss still getting it

Young bad bitches like to call the boss daddy
Niggas stay stuntin and be live on stage
Throwing big faces gotta show em getting paid

And I’m a be that way until I lay up in the grave

Thug life man we the king of the block
Riding that drop double R like Pac
Still kept shining even when them boys stop
I make country rap tunes, never did hip hop
That’s why I ain’t stop cause a hustla got slow
Here pow wow hurry up with my Moe
So slow gudda so flow oh flow
Got my sachet, shades on and the boot wherever I go
Keep a bad bitch matter of fact I keep plenty
Bad bitches I ain’t hit, it ain’t that many
Just wave em in just in case you get many
Got a pretty white bitch in Dallas back in 97
Old school flow make my city say man
My back on the budda same colour, Peter Pan
Waving at your bitch a hunnid thousand in my hand
Knock the window of the foreign looking so spic and span
Caught couple hundred grand if me see me on it
Wish I could send some fo so I can spend it
Everything paid for ain’t shit rented
I smoke and drive so all my shit tinted
Balling to the limit you should see my hater’s face
Knowing when I show up they back in last place
Moving at my own pace feeling too cool to race
When it comes to being a hustler put me with the greats

Yeah I’m stuntin when I’m on I’m getting
Hit the boulevard and I got the trunk hidden
