Everybody loves a pimp
Sha tapperbacker preach
Everybody loves a pimp
Sha tapperbacker preach
Everybody loves a pimp
The way I talk the way I dress
I keep so clean I'm fresh
(everybody loves a pimp)
The ice I wear the car I drive
(everybody loves a pimp)
The ho's I got they look so fly
(everybody loves a pimp)
When ya pimpish ya pimpin
(everybody loves a pimp)
When ya pimpish ya pimpin
(everybody loves a pimp)

[verse 1 - slim thug]
You know tha boss got bitches galore you may have a lot of bitches but he got much more from dkny to the Malibu shores I got a chick in ever city I can
Go on tour and you need a pimp in yo life that is gonna guide you right won't hand cuff you when you tryin' to creep at night I don't sleep at night anymore
But now I don't care I be hibernating call me yogi the bear
I'm a pimp baby that's why I hold my nuts and walk with a limp baby I know you get tired of all this sense
So go and hop on my team and loose your wimp baby
