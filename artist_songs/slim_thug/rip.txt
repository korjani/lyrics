[Verse 1 - Slim Thug:]
We lost so many H-Town legends
I know y'all still reppin up in heaven
Never got a chance to meet Fat Pat and wreck on a track
I po up with Screw how SUC used to do (Damn)
My nigga HAWK was one of the realest off the South Side
Broke my heart when I heard my nigga died (RIP)
Tragic, mother lost both her sons
And the H-Town lost another legend reppin where we from
I wish my nigga Big Moe was here, we miss ya Barre Baby
Got the whole world barre crazy
The first ones rapping about pouring up, sipping out of white cups
I'm just tryna pay homage, look out for it we brung it (H-Town)
And if it wasn't for my nigga Pimp C
Me and Ro wouldn't be rapping together, RIP
We miss you and I said it
Thinking back on the good old days
I'll mourn ya till I join ya, screwed up always
RIP

[Hook - Z-Ro:]
Give people their flowers while they're here
Tommorow isn't promised they could be dead in a year
I can't even promise myself I'm gon' still be here
So I tell all my homies I love'em while we still here
Give people their flowers while they're here
Tommorow isn't promised they could be dead in a year
I can't even promise myself I'm gon' still be here
So I tell all my homies I love'em while we still here

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro:]
I wonder if my momma was alive
Would she be proud?
Shit she probably be telling me I need to stop smoking all that loud
Yeah I raised myself, cause she was gone
Six years old and a foster home
But I think I turned out alright
Cause a nigga be countin money all night
Man I miss my nigga Big Mello, hell no
Ain't gon' ever forget ya
He was like fuck that one deep shit
I lock the door I'm gon' roll with ya
And I miss my nigga DJ Screw, but I called him Robert Earl
Drove him around, we used to drankin' to Joseph and Robert Earl
That's the reason I roll one deep
I'm tired of seeing my niggas dead in the street
December 1st
South West gorilla really died in a holdin tank?
That's why I'm like fuck the police I ain't tryna end up in a holdin tank
So many dead homies I'm out of tears
If they ain't dead they got a lot of years
Shannon Hayes doin 30 flat
It's been so long is he ever comin back?
And my nigga AB got 25
D-Moe and [?] ain't even alive
Imma mourn y'all until I join y'all
RIP
