[Slim Thug:]
All my niggas bosses all my niggas hustlers
All my niggas gettin money all my niggas 100
All my niggas been on all my niggas stay silent
All my niggas some players all my niggas done retired
Pulled up drop head pulled off in a spur
So gone off patron I forgot to pull out of her
Whole life is a blurr get money get high
Weed habit too expensive but ain't none else I wanna try
Tryna see what else I wanna buy I'ma fly type of guy
Still feel like I'm winning you see these forgis spinning?
Feel like I'm back in the beginning feel like I keep getting better
When I look at my new bitches I feel like I keep getting better
Used to roll in the slabs since deuces in a dab
Now I can't talk about cars without making them mad
They say I brag too much cause I talk about stuff they ain't touched
I rap for hustlers livin' that boss life like us
Watch out lil bitch, watch out lil bitch

[Trill Sammy:]
Watch out lil hoe, watch out lil hoe
I been smoking gas out the O
I been countin' up you ain't know
Just checked out my wrist it's so gold
Just looked at my chain it's on froze damn
I ain't come over here for nothin' bitch you know we is fuckin'
That OG gas I'm puffin' runni' up bands comin' from nothin'
Check out the ass on my bitch she butt naked whippin a brick
I might just empty the clip
Don't come in my trap takin' pics

[Dice Soho:]
Hold up, wait a min they done let me through the door
Now my pockets full of dough my life a movie like Blow
I'm icy my wist is on snow she want me I already know
Fucked the bitch right on the floor then after she gotta go
Watch how I run up them bandz
Pops told me run it up run it up
Workin' all night till the sun is up
Now niggas is pissed that we comin' up
Jumpin' in the crowd I be foolin'
Dice Soho I'm swervin' and zoomin' icy like bitch we just coolin'
Schoolin' these niggas like students
Shawty she thick and she fine hit that pussy from behind
Pull out and bust on her spine if it's good I hit her one more time
