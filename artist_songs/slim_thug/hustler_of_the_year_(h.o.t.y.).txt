I’m a give you ant there man
I’m a tell a day in the life of my life
That hour glass nigga

Every day I wake up took a look up in the mirror
Tell myself Thugga you’s the hustler of the year
Self motivated, look around at the crib
Hell yeah thugga you the hustler of the year

I gotta get this money myself
I gotta pay my bills by myself
I gotta go out here and get it
I’m my own boss, don’t need no help
I gotta stay away from distractions
That’s gonna stop me from seeing my goals
I gotta focus on my paper
Tell see you later to these hoes (see you later)
I gotta make sure I break free
From anybody trying to hold me back
I gotta make sure I keep moving
Cause standing still ain’t gon’ bring me stacks
I gotta make sure I ain’t getting lazy
Cause I’m getting money, I gotta get more
I gotta motivate myself cause everybody wanna see me broke
Thugga you the hustler of the year
Drop four albums back to back
Got some slining shirts and shoes
On that M&M like it’s crack
Got a yard full of them toys but still hustle like you broke
Always chasing that next level
Gotta otta money but still won’t leverage

Every day I wake up took a look up in the mirror
Tell myself Thugga you’s the hustler of the year
Self motivated, look around at the crib
Hell yeah thugga you the hustler of the year

Got so many grind checks come from everywhere
Hell yeah Thugga you the hustler of the year
Line my hair, I wake up got a million dollar idea
Hell yeah Thugga you the hustler of the year

Don’t do the cool I do this shit by Maloney
Stays one hundred, never, ever been phony
All I make is cheese you call me macaroni
Hustle hard thinking like a cocaine Tony
The world is mine nigga, you know Thugga bout his business
Riding one D cause you might turn with me
Tryna get better every day I’m on my fitness
Just in case I gotta get ghost with the quickness
Had to switch bills, take it to another level
Gotta keep it moving, can’t get caught up by the devil
Temptation just waiting to take over my life
Married to success, getting papers’ my wife

Every day I wake up took a look up in the mirror
Tell myself Thugga you’s the hustler of the year
Self motivated, look around at the crib
Hell yeah thugga you the hustler of the year

Every time you see me stepping out in the fresh gear
Hell yeah thugga you the hustler of the year
Still stay fresh still riding with the Yeah
Thugga you the motherfucking hustler of the year
You the hustler of the year
