Didn't mean to take you for granted
Didn't mean to show I don't care
Didn't mean to throw away this once in a lifetime of chance
Being with you

And I'll drive for 2 hours
To bring butterfingers
I don't mind the distance
This kismet's a dance

This time I surrender
My everything forever
Life doesn't matter
Just our souls together

Pride no longer has room in me
On bended knees in public I cry
Your name for everyone to know that I love you, I love you
Please hear me now

And I'll drive for 2 hours
To bring butterfingers
I don't mind the distance
This kismet's a dance

This time I surrender
My everything forever
Life doesn't matter
Just our souls together

This time I surrender
My everything forever
Life doesn't matter
Just our souls together

And I'll drive for 2 hours
To bring butterfingers
I don't mind the distance
This kismet's a dance (dance, dance)

This time I surrender
My everything forever
Life doesn't matter
Just our souls together

This time I surrender
My everything forever
Life doesn't matter
Just our souls together

This time I surrender
My everything...(my everything)...

And I'll drive for 2 hours
To bring butterfingers
I don't mind the distance
This kismet's a dance
