[Drew:]
I don't need to be impressive, I don't need to run the game
I don't want to keep on chasing, let it all just come my way

But hey ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright

[Drew:]
I don't need no bumping music, all I need is my guitar
I don't need no late night cruising, I don't even got a car

But hey ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright

[Keaton:]
I wanna lay low, not just cause I'm broke
I wanna stay home and have a kick back tonight.
Sorry not sorry, am I (I, I ooh)

[All:]
Let's ditch the party ignore everybody
And we'll make spaghetti and it'd be all heady
Like, ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright
So don't fear tomorrow, let that be the motto
And just pass the bottle and we'll make it hollow
Like, ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright, tonight

[Drew:]
I don't want no debby downer, I just wanna keep my buzz
I don't wanna know no drama, we don't gotta trip because

Ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright

Like, ayeee ee ayee ee everything's gonna be alright, alright tonight
