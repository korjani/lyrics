[Wes:]
You called me, said he broke your heart again
Won't you let me pick up the pieces?
Let me pick up all the pieces baby.
You said even though you're not with him,
That your life's too complicated.
When you're in this situation,
There's not much that I can say to you,
But I would never lie.
As long as I've got you next to me,
Tonight I've got to try.

[Chorus:]
I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between,
I saved it all for you.
So hit me with a yes (yes)
You gotta let me know (know)
I wanna be everything that you need
I'll never let you go

I'm giving you the...
And I'm giving you a...
So I'm giving you the...
Yeah, I'm giving you a...

[Keaton:]
I don't wanna go too fast
But it's really hard to take it slow
When you feel the way that I do
Whenever I'm around you
Girl you're beautiful.
And I know that I could make you feel
Like you're sittin' on top of the world.
And if you gave me half a chance,
I know I'd make you mine.

[Chorus:]
I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between,
I saved it all for you.
So hit me with a yes (yeah)
You gotta let me know (know)
I wanna be everything that you need
I'll never let you go

I'm giving you the...
And I'm giving you a...
So I'm giving you the...
Yeah, I'm giving you a...

I'm giving you the X's, X's
O, O, O, O, O, O's
I'm giving you the X's, X's
O, O, O, O, O, O's

[Drew:]
Click click, like a Cupid on a rampage.
Bang, bang put it right through my rib cage
Pinky, ring, middle finger down with the thumb
A simple way to let you know that you're my number one
Chirp, chirp like a bird 'cause you're so fly
I wanna study your anatomy, Bill Nye
I'll show you I can shake you harder than a bass drum.
I'm not a cable guy but I know how to get it done.

[Chorus:]
I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between,
I saved it all for you.
So hit me with a yes (yeah)
You gotta let me know (know)
I wanna be everything that you need
I'll never let you go

I'm giving you the...
And I'm giving you a...
So I'm giving you the...
Yeah I'm giving you a...

I'm giving you the X's, X's
O, O, O, O, O, O's
X's, X's
O, O, O, O, O, O's
