Front page magazine
Everybody says that she's a queen
But that's you to me
And I just want to let you know that
She likes the flashing lights
I love the way that you like candle light
Stay close by my side
I just want a chance to show that

[Keaton and Drew]
(but you're the one I want)
If only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you
I-I do
(but you're the one I want)
If only you could see all of the beautiful things that I see in you
It's true-oo-oo-oo

[Drew]
Fast lanes, limousines
Baby, there can be no guarantees
But if, you're with me, you know I can guarantee that
Cause I'm attracted to your passion,
Be yourself, forget the fashion
Just keep that smile on your face
You and I deserve to be forever ever lasting
