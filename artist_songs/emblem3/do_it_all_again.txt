Soon as I walked into the party this girl came up to me and started to dance. 
Had a tattoo on her neck and a ring in her tongue and some tight leather pants. 
After the song she pulled me in the bathroom and locked it and turned off the lights, 
Then when I turned them back on she was gone, but it wasn't the end of the night.

And at twelve forty five, that's when my homies arrived, 
At a quarter to two everyone jumped in the pool, 
Now the suns gonna rise, we must've lost track of time, 
There won't be another tonight but as soon as it ends

We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again, 
No were not going home 
Till the speakers are blown, 
Feeling like woooaaahh, 
We'll do it all again,
We'll do it all again, 
We'll be up in the clubs, 
Till the cops shut us down, 
Feeling like wooaahh, 
We'll do it all again

Soon as I woke up I promised myself that I'd be staying in for the night,
Said that'd I'd go back to sleep but then I got a text from a girl that I like, 
She told me to go get a couple of friends and that she had a couple of friends, 
And we in the car on the way to the party about to do it again

And at twelve forty five, that's when my homies arrived, 
At a quarter to two everyone jumped in the pool, 
Now the suns gonna rise, we must've lost track of time, 
There won't be another tonight but as soon as it ends

We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again, 
No were not going home 
Till the speakers are blown, 
Feeling like woooaaahh, 
We'll do it all again,
We'll do it all again, 
We'll be up in the clubs, 
Till the cops shut us down, 
Feeling like wooaahh, 
We'll do it all again

(We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again)

We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again, 
No were not going home 
Till the speakers are blown, 
Feeling like woooaaahh, 
We'll do it all again,
We'll do it all again, 
We'll be up in the clubs, 
Till the cops shut us down, 
Feeling like wooaahh, 
We'll do it all again

(We'll do it all again, 
We'll do it all again)

We'll do it all again...
