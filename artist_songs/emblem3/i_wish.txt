I wish this bed was an island
We could stay here inside until the sun went down
We'd turn these blankets to hammocks
And we'd be hand in hand until the stars came out

We escaped from the city lights
Only glow is the moon from the high tide
Say goodbye to the traffic on the freeway
Every single day we could play in the sea-waves
We can even pick new names
We can hide from the search planes
I'd be out surfing, you'd be out shirtless
Everything's perfect

Don't have a care in the world (I don't got a care in the world)
You got me all to yourself now girl
We've got no reason to leave (We don't got a reason to leave)
Cuz all I need is you and me

I wish this bed was an island
Cuz nobody could find us, we'd be on our own
We'd stare out at the horizon
As we sit by the fire singing all night long

Yea,
Me Tarzan, you Jane
Lay under the palm trees to get shade
Damn, you got a perfect tan
People on the mainland wouldn't understand
What it's like dipping toes in the white sand
What it's like every night going caveman
No tan lines, just you and I
Sipping coconuts like it's, like it's white wine

Don't have a care in the world (I don't got a care in the world)
You got me all to yourself now girl
We've got no reason to leave (We don't got a reason to leave)
Cuz all I need is you and me (You and me, yeah)

I wish this bed was an island
We could stay here inside until the sun went down
We'd send our message in bottles, cuz nobody could call us
We'd be lost and found

I'ma take, take, take ya there
I'ma take, take, take ya there

We'll be lost and found, yea

I'ma take, take, take ya there
I'ma take, take, take ya there

'Til the stars come out, yea

I'ma take, take, take ya there
I'ma take, take, take ya there

'Til the stars come out, yeah

I'ma take, take, take ya there
I'ma take, take, take ya there
