[Keaton:]
Sick of all the people talkin' 'bout me
When they don't really know me
They don't really see the same as I see
Well, I know what I'm supposed to be

[Wesley:]
People show me love but then they judge me
Why they gotta treat me so shady?
They think that they sit above all things
But really, in the shadows they are drowning

[Both:]
I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up
I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up

When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there
And time will tell, time will tell
Who really cares, who really cares
All's well that ends well
And I'll be there to figure this out
When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there

[Keaton:]
It feels like I'm living in a bad dream
But positivity is what will save me
They never said that it'd be easy
But until you put in the work, you're not worthy

[Wesley:]
I don't know where the path may lead
But focusing on the light will help me see
I'm not scared to get my hands dirty
As long as I finish strong on my journey

[Both:]
I said I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up
I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up

When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there
And time will tell, time will tell
Who really cares, who really cares
All's well that ends well
And I'll be there to figure this out
When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there

[Wesley:]
(Love will be there)

[Both:]
Love will be there-ere-ere-ere
Love will be there-ere-ere-ere
Love will be there-ere-ere-ere
Love will be there-ere-ere

[Both:]
I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up
I've had enough, had enough, had enough
But I'll never give up

When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there
And time will tell, time will tell
Who really cares, who really cares
All's well that ends well
And I'll be there to figure this out
When all else fails, all else fails
Love will be there, love will be there

Love will be there-ere-ere-ere
Love will be there-ere-ere-ere
Love will be there-ere-ere-ere

Love will be there
