Sometimes I lay
Under the moon
And thank God I'm breathing
And then I pray
Don't take me soon

'Cause I'm here for a reason
Sometimes in my tears I drown
I will never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday this will all turn around
Because

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
And there'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day [x8]

It's not about
Win or lose
We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the world is still raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy but don't let it get in your way (no way)

Sometimes in my tears I drown
I will never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday this'll all turn around
Because

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day [x8]

Some day this all will change
Treat people the same
So stop with the violence
Down with the hate
One day we'll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like
Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
I will never let it get me down (Get me down)
And when negativity surrounds (Surrounds)
I know someday this'll all turn around because

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (fight no more)
There'll be no more wars (no more wars)
And our children will play
One day [x8]
