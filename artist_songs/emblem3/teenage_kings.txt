I take a puff of my cigarillo,
Then I say what up like, "Hello."
Party hard, pedal to the metal.
A part of growing up is living like a rebel.
No stoppin the girls from teeny-boppin.
No tops, just rockin bikini bottoms.
Backyard boxin, half pipe droppin,
The jocks and the nerds man everybody's rockin.

And when we are all looking back
(One day when we're lookin back),
We'll think of this night so let's make it last.

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous.
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless.
It's a five-day fight til the saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low.
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah.

I take a sip of another Red Bull,
Everybody on the move lookin for someone to XO.
Everything is good, and everything is cool,
Except for the fool who fell into the pool.
What up ladies, I'm glad that you could stop by.
Freshmen trippin out because you got high.
And daisy dukes when you walk by, I swat thighs.
Let the good times roll and let the top fly.

And when we are all looking back
(One day when we're lookin back),
We'll think of this night so let's make it last.

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous.
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless.
It's a five-day fight til the saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low.
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah.

Nina with Josie, with Jack McColl.
Jay's actin dumb runnin into walls.
Someone's passed out with the candle.
We're rollin, we're rollin, like teenage kings.

And when we are all looking back,
We'll think of this night so let's make it last.

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous.
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless.
It's a five-day fight til the saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low.
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah
