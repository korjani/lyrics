Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. yeah, yeah yeah... yeahh... 

I'll never slip out this vibe, vibe.
I get high through the low times. Yeahh...
And for a minute I forget that, that I miss you. 
And in that moment doesn't matter that I miss you. Yeah!
I know that I'll get over you, you. Yeah!
And in the moment its true. true. Yeah!
And for a minute I forget that, that I miss you. 
And in that moment doesn't matter that I miss you. Yeah!

[Chorus]
Say what you mean, mean what to say! 
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
Say what you mean, mean what to say!
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
I said I wish that it could be.. 
I said I wish that I could be..

Uh Yeah. I say. 
Yea we vibe like the tide on the seaside.
I don't want no kush, I want you to get me high.
G-G-Get me by. I try and laugh but it sounds more like a deep sigh.
Everything I know.
Everything thing I thought I knew.
Its got me wondering if I ever really had a clue.
I can try with her but the whole time all I ever think about is you.
Theres no love in making love, if that love inst true.

I know that I'll get over you, you. Yeah!
And in this moment its true. True. Yeah!
And for a minute I forget that, that I miss you. 
And in that moment doesn't matter that I miss you. Yeah!

[Chorus]
Say what you mean, mean what to say! 
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
Say what you mean, mean what to say!
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
I said I wish that it could be.. 
I said I wish that I could be..

Da da, da da, do do, da da do.
Da da, da da, do do, da da do.
Da da, da da, do do, da do.
Da da, da da, do do, da do.

I'll get over you. (I'll get over you.)
I'll get over you.

[Chorus]
Say what you mean, mean what to say! 
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
Say what you mean, mean what to say!
(say what you mean, mean what to say!)
I said I wish that it could be.. 
I said I wish that I could be..

[Instrumental]

Yeah.. yeah.. yeahh..
