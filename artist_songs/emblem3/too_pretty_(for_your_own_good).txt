Too pretty for your own good
I can tell that you're no good
The way you show
All these necks that you're breaking
When you walk by, you're so banging
Girl, and you know it

1, 2
18, first car was a Beemer
Uptown, first time that I seen her
You can tell by the way that she looks that
Her mommy was a model and her daddy was a dreamer
19, dressed up for the evening
Dolled up, definition of deceiving
Fake ID, not gonna need it
Hops on my bod and we're gone for the weekend

You think you're perfect cause you got the curves
Well where is your heart? Yeah
You know you're an angel, just don't lose the halo
You had from the start

Too pretty for your own good
I can tell that you're no good
The way you show
All these necks that you're breaking
When you walk by, you're so banging
Girl, and you know it
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your

Spray tan and the hair done platinum
High heels, Louis purse to match 'em
Took a ride on a day to see about
Whether she was in it for the fame or the passion
Light a candle, the scent is on
You don't need love when you got your phone
These Instagram girls, all around the globe
Think they got it all, but they really don't

You think you're perfect cause you got the curves
Well where is your heart? Yeah
You know you're an angel, just don't lose the halo
You had from the start

Too pretty for your own good
I can tell that you're no good
The way you show
All these necks that you're breaking
When you walk by, you're so banging
Girl, and you know it
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your own good
Too pretty for your

Wow, yeah yeah, oh
Too pretty for your
Strong as a halo

Too pretty for your own good
I can tell that you're no good
The way you show
All these necks that you're breaking
When you walk by, you're so banging
Girl, and you know it
