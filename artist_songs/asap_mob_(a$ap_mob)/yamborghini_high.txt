My mama told me save that money, bank accounts, don't spend that bread
Cash out on new necklaces, 14 karat bracelet
Dibble dabble with the lean
Hi-Tech with the cream soda

Lambo red, Coca Cola
My bros, Cosa Nostra
Ridin' on a speedboat
She suckin dick and deep throat
Rey Mysterio
When I'm jumpin' off the top rope
Banana clip with the scope
Wearin' all white
Like I'm the mothafuckin' pope

Yammy's vision got us rich, catch a nigga flyin' by in a Lambo

My Jewelry glistening why I’m always chilly
Can't believe a nigga made a couple milli'
'Bout to cop the house way up in the hillies
With a bad bitch in the Bentley
Wood grain with the roof gone
Make a bitch fold like a futon
Gettin' bread like a crouton
