[Chorus - A$AP Nast:]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 1 - A$AP Nast:]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm hardcore buzzing
Ain't got time for fronting
Ain't got time for nothing
I'm 90's era, quit your speculation boy
That's Nasty baby, 90's crazy like who fucking with the boy?
I'm super low though
My hat, my tee, my sneaks, my jeans, and all that
Perform in all black
Your bitch is wet like where her drawers at
Ass fat and all that
I fuck her once and never call back
Can't trust these dusty bitches on my ball sack
Fuck with the dog rap
You clowns could hate and get your skull cracked
When I be wasted taking blunts of Cali's finest cookies to the face
How you replace a G with warm hearted rapper type to act alike
No we don't rap alike
The son of Satan, flow courageous

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - A$AP Twelvyy:]
Dumb niggas hustle for hoes
Young niggas hustle for clothes
And real niggas hustle for gold
Over here we just hustle and flow
And get a down ass bitch to try smoke up some dope
And spit it hard like that uncle that O
You know, that one at the door?
Nigga knocking trying to get him some dough
I spit what I know
Vivid you could picture the flow
I sit with the Pope
Hood on I'm mixing the po
Catch me hopping off jets
Hopping to the jects
Ain't '96 but I prolly push a Lex
Mid white Airs in my fresh Nordic sweats
In the staircase with my crew smoking sets
See my set in the front them other niggas in the back
Bitches grab your titties all my niggas bust your gats
One for the money, two for the trap
Lords and the G, double guns and the macs

[Verse 3 - A$AP Rocky:]
Highly recommended, started epidemics
Hoped for the college but I had the best tuition
Momma had the best interest couldn't tell it different
Chrissy sippin, plenty women, what the fuck you representing?
I'm out for presidents to represent me
Prezi, Bently, head from Lindsey
Like Lohan? nigga evidently
Got hoes in every city hella swift
Ones who had that bag
Yellow bitch tell her strip
Life ain't been the same ever since
The odd ball in the room full of elephants
My elegance take me to them other elements
Wear jewels on jewels my chain full of evidence
My jewelry is a jewelry and my face got embezzlement
Motherfuck a delicate, syndicate, intelligent
Connected out to the Netherlands
My amigos out moving... again
So tell a friend and tell a friend
Run and tell a friend and tell a friend
Email, tweet, or mail a friend
That crack I got is for sale again
I swear that purple lean is like my medicine
Invited with some weed and we the best of friends
Prolly taking me to places never been
And my voice up in my head again, represent

[Chorus]
