Second guessing, never learn my lessons,
Always chasing after, what somebody else had stole,
When you took your chances, I wasn’t burnt to ashes,
And your broken promises have left you out in the cold,
With each lie that you told, lie that you told,

I learn a little more, learn a little more,
And it was brighter before, brighter,
Your love don’t shine anymore,
You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone.

So now I’m walking with me eyes wide open,
But I fell off the track, but now I’m back in control,
So I saw through you, the crystal waters are so blue,
And my smile is back again it had been away for so long,
‘Cause with each lie that you told, lie that you told,

I learn a little more, learn a little more,
And it was brighter before, brighter,
Your love don’t shine anymore,
You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone.

The harder I try the easier it is to walk, walk away,
The harder I try the easier it is to walk away,

You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone.
Diamond to a stone,
Diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone,
Like a diamond to a stone.
