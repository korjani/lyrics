I used to know a girl, who had a dream
Her head full of ambition, her heart filled with pain
Walking the same walk, seeing the same faces
Wishing she could, trade places

Maybe I could fly away, she'd say
Even though time's moved on,
I still feel the same

And I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

Every good thing comes at a price
Sometimes you just gotta melt the ice
It's not a question of when, just how
After all this time, I've found

That I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

It may take time to find my feet
You'll get there sometime, they say to me

But I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

I'm gonna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I, I'm gonna run free,
And I, I'm gonna fly away
