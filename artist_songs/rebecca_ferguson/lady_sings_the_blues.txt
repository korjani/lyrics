Lady sing the blues,
she's got them bad,
she feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
nothing to hide.

And now the world will know,
just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
when you get a bad start,
when you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
I know I won't die,
'cause I love him

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
but now the world will know,
she's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got them bad,
but now the world will know,
she's never gonna sing them no more.
