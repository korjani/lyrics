I almost crumbled
I almost fell
I almost gave you everything under your spell

You almost mattered
You almost won
You held my fears and weakness 
In the web you spun

Took what you wanted
But you're leaving with nothing
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
I'll carry on, marching

Hope you enjoyed it
But you're leaving with nothing
Nothing, nothing

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna face my fears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

I almost stumbled
When you shot me down
You almost got the best of me and stole my crown

The glass was shattered
As it hit the ground
This endeavor enough for you, it's over now

Took what you wanted
But you're leaving with nothing
Nothing, nothing

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna face my fears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna face my fears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start

I almost crumbled
I almost fell
I almost gave you everything but you've failed
