Truly I say to you, not a day I don't think about your smile
And how tired they've been
You've done the bottles, you've paced the halls
Cause deep down I know, there's a strength from within

So why don't you smile, cause smiling is all you have
And why don't you trust instead of getting mad
Cause not all love's dependent and changing
There's some that is real
Never ending
No sorrow lives there
No sorrow lives there

Will you hold me
Cause I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking

Didn't turn out as you thought
Fairytale was more like the wall
How innocent you are
No father just crushed dreams
It's not exactly your knight in shining armour
Not much of a king

So why don't you smile, cause smiling is all you have
And why don't you trust instead of getting mad
Cause not all love's dependent and changing
There's some that is real
Never ending
No sorrow lives there
No sorrow lives there

Will you hold me
Cause I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking

You're been playing on my mind lately
Want to help you, don't leave me behind
Docs saying I'm going crazy
Rumour has it that love is blind
And my back's against the wall
Yeah, you already took my shine
And I've found the dream I was dreaming
Wasn't mine

Will you hold me
Cause I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking

You've been playing on my mind lately
The docs saying I'm going crazy
But I can't sleep at night
Knowing that you're not alright
