I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
And looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? 
I just thought about you
I just thought about you

I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

I peeped through the crack
And looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? 
I just thought about you
Yes I thought about you
I just thought about you
I just thought about you
