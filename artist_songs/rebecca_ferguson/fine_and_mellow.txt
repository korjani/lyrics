My man, he don't love me
Treats me oh so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night 
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night 
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

But if you treat me right baby
I'll stay home every day
But, iIf you treat me right baby
I'll stay home every day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on

Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone

That boys gonna drive me away
That boys gonna drive me away
That boys gonna drive me away
