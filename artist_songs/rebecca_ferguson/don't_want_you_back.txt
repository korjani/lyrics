Yeah, I know you've been drinking
Maybe one too many
Maybe that got you thinking
That you're getting back with me
So tell me is there another
Who's got your heart locked down
Cause I can't help but wonder
Who'll be keeping you now

You look so good, but my heart said no
Can't help myself, gotta let you go

I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back
I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back

Memories come flooding back to you
When you're home and lonely
I'm not thinking of you
You keep me waiting in my dark blue jeans
But truth hit me like lightning
But now I'm back on my feet

You look so good, but my heart said no
Can't help myself, gotta let you go

I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back
I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back

I don't want him, want him, want him
I don't need him, need him, need him
Then why don't you tell him, tell him, tell him
I don't want him back
See I don't want his hugging, hugging, hugging
And I don't want his kissing, kissing, kissing
So tell me what I'm missing, missing, missing
I don't want you back

I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back
I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back
I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Don't you go and ruin my party
I just wanna say, I just wanna say
Don't think that I want you back
