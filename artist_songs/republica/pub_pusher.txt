On Heavenly Sunday as he touches your insides
He said the last thing on my mind was to cheat on you
Go down Queensway as you start another fight
You know it spoils my appetite you're a selfish boy
Just sit and wonder as your dreams go up in smoke
You're stealing cars and selling dope
Now you've sold your soul
And I'm hanging out with Mortal Combat 2
And Haagen-Daaz and early Cure
How I miss you so
Pub pusher onlookers
Call for pizza there's a pub pusher on the ground
Pub pusher born loser
Call the doctor there's a pub pusher on the ground
Pub pusher tried to kill ya
Call the cops there's a pub pusher on the ground
On his back there's a pub pusher on the ground
Give blood there's a pub pusher on the ground
Pub pusher call the preacher
They don't believe there's a pub pusher on the ground
Pub pusher
Pub pusher
Pub pusher
Pub pusher
