Bigelow the gigolo had no where else to go
His sad eyes had seen it all
Scarred and lonely, tough as nails
Open your heart when all else fails
Wear the veil and the trojan horse smile

Looking back on yesteryear
Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling
But hindsight is very clear when loneliness is falling

And you have fallen down, down from the heavens
Stuck out in the desert
Amazing grace - such a lonely place
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
To carry you away

Target practice with other people's lives
Hit a few right between the eyes
But, most of the time, you were wounded by the ricochet
You say "play to win, boys, never play to lose
Long as you're playing, boy, you're bullet-proof"
But think about it - you're bleeding to death anyway

And you have fallen down, down from the heavens
Stuck out in the desert
Amazing grace - such a lonely place
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by

Angel of mercy, take pity on a fool
That spent a lifetime wondering
What Napoleon would do
If he were in your shoes

Rich, without pleasure - respected without love
Drinking poison from a golden cup
While anger, brother of fear, creeps like a knife into your heart

Looking back on yesteryear
Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling
But hindsight is very clear when loneliness is falling
And destiny's through (still) calling

And you have fallen down - fallen down
Amazing grace - it's such a lonely place
Oh yes it is
Fallen down
Fallen down

Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen down
