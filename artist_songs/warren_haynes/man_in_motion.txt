Still life is overrated
Burn-out factor is part of the game
Life should be an adventure
Anything else is a crying shame
People gather round to see
Day by day
Just what he's gonna be
He's here, he's gone
He's moving on

What do you expect the boy to do
He's just a fire burning
A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion

Hard to say when the motion began
Big time dreams in a
Small town man
Some days peace of mind
Is all you hope to find
Folks back home wouldn't understand
Moving town to town
Band to band
You say someday you're gonna stop
But they keep moving the finish line

What do you expect the boy to do
He's just a fire burning
A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion

His life has been a race
Love of the game thrill of the chase
It's only 8 seconds but you live for the ride

What do you expect the boy to do
What do you expect the boy to do
He's just a fire burning
A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
Proceed with caution
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion
