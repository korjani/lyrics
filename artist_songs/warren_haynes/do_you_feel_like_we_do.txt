Well, woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine? What wine? Where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on, let's do it again

Do you, you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you, you, feel like I do?

My friend got busted, just the other day
They said, "Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away"
Drove him to a taxi, bent the boot, hit the bag
Had to play some music, wonder why's he brag or drag

Do you, you, feel like I do?
How'd ya turns from mic, can't catch it
Do you, you, feel like I
Do you, you, feel like I do?
Yes ya do
Do you, you, feel like I do?

Champagne for breakfast and a Sherman in my hand
Peached up, peached ale, never fails
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on, let's do it again

Do you, you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you, you, feel like I
Do you feel like we do?
Do you feel like we do?
Oh, that's true
Do you feel like we do?
Get back
Do you feel do you feel like we do?

Oh baby do you feel?
Oh baby do you feel, feel like we do?
Do you feel, do you feel, like we do?
I want to thank you
Do you feel like we do?
That's alright, that's alright to feel you'd like,
Feel you'd like, a good time
We'll go to bed and good night
Good time, good time, good time, good time, good time
