Do ya know me?
I'm the driving rain.
And my Momma, was a hurricane.
Dear old Daddy, 'fore he stormed out
High on window pane [?]
Said, "You my one and only boy child,
Call you the Drivin' Rain."

Drivin' Rain
Drivin' Rain
T- t- talkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives them insane
They all want to know me
I'm the drivin' rain

It all started
Back in 69
Yeah, I hit the ground runnin'
Couldn't wait to hear those gears grind
Just like my Daddy
I'm stone cold outta my mind
I've been 'round this world
One, two, three, four, five hundred times

Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
I'm talk talk-talkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives them insane
They all want to know me
Yeah, I'm the drivin' rain

Do you remember
First time you heard that thunder call?
Wind was moanin'
Creepin' through your bedroom wall
Moonlight splashin'
Enough to make a rich girl fall
Lightenin' crashin'
Make a strong strong woman crawl

Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
T-t-talkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
T-t-talkin' 'bout
T-t-talkin' 'bout the
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
T-t-talkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives 'em insane
Well they all want to know me
Yeah, I'm the drivin' rain
