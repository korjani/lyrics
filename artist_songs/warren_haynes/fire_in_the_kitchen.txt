Midnight another day in the life of a loser
Spotlight moon shining over head
This part of the city sleeps with one eye open
Bars on the door protection by the bed

There's a child with a gun tired and on the run
Black brown blue what does it matter?
And there's 15 more down on every corner
Stranded no place left to turn

Fire in the kitchen
Fire in the kitchen burning down
Fire in the kitchen fire
Lord send us some cool cool water or
Ain't nobody gonna get no sleep tonight

Cold day another cold cold day in hell
What you sow so shall ye reap
Bedlam spreading like a rumor
Can't take people and push them out in the street

Fire in the kitchen
Fire in the kitchen burning down
Fire in the kitchen fire
Lord send us some cool cool water or
Ain't nobody gonna get no sleep tonight

There's a child with a gun tired and on the run
Black brown blue what does it matter?
And there's 15 more down on every corner
Stranded no place left to turn
