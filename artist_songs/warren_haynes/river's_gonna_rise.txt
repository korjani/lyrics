Darkness hides the faces
Of we who hold the power
We don't need to be rich
We only need to be free
Chains of oppression
Never gonna break
But a day will come when we hold the key
Time will remind us
That the people still have a choice
And we don't want violence
Until there's no other choice

But the river's gonna rise
Wash our struggles away
The sun is gonna shine
Shine down on a brand new day

Bells will be ringing
Flames reaching to the sky
Higher and higher
Fueled by the winds of change
Sweet taste of freedom
Fresh on the tips of our tongues
And the dust of the past is all that shall remain
Echoes of our voices
Ringing all through the town
Will drown out the memories
Of the days when we were bound

The river's gonna rise
Wash our struggles away
The sun is gonna shine
Shine down on a brand new day

Yeah, we're gonna rise up singing
Like a bird on the wing
A million hearts beating
To the rhythm that the new day brings

The river's gonna rise
The river's gonna rise
The river's gonna rise
Wash our struggles away
And the sun is sun is gonna shine
Shine down on the brand new day
Shine down on the brand new day
Shine down on the brand new day
