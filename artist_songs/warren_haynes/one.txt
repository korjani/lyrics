Is it getting better? Is it still the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now that you got someone to blame
You say one love, one life, one voice in the night
One, we get to share it leaves you baby if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you leaving bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same we carry each other
Carry each other, one

To come here for forgiveness, to come to raise the dead
To come here to play Jesus, to all the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but not the same we hurt each other, then we do it again

And you say love is the temple, love the higher law
Love is the temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
All you got is hurt, when all you got is hurt

And you say love is the temple, love the higher law
Love is the temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
