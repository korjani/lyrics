Well baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

You're back out on the street
And you're tryin' to remember
How will you start it over?
You don't know what became
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy too well, farewell

So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away

And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time

Another love has come and gone
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
We got to leave it alone"

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time
