I see you but I can't believe you're here
I can't believe you're near enough for me to touch
Why you're wanting me so much?

You're back
Back for one more try
But you should realize that things are different now
Ever since you quit

Coming around, bringing me down, I said we were through, now I'm over you

But you could change my mind
Little girl, if you wanted to
When you look at me the way you do
I'm easy, so damn easy
You look so good and you look so fine
Girl, you know
You could change my mind

I hear you but I can't believe what you say
You're the one that got away from me so long ago
Don't act like you don't know

Why I can't make up my mind
I can't give you the time of day 'cause I'm afraid
That you'll just keep

Running away, what can I say, I gotta go, the answer is no

But you could change my mind
Little girl, if you wanted to
When you look at me the way you do
I'm easy, so damn easy
You look so good and you look so fine
Girl, you know
You could change my mind

Take it on home, leave me alone, I'll say it again, this is the end

But you could change my mind
Little girl, if you wanted to
When you look at me the way you do
I'm easy, yeah I'm  easy
You look so good and you look so fine
Girl, you know
You could change my mind

You look so good and you so fine
Girl, you know
You could change my mind
