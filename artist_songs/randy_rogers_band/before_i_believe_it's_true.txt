Well I've never seen this place 
but I've been here waiting for you
I've held onto your love forever
Tell me you wanted me to
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true

Wait just a minute baby
Don't make a single move
Prop me up just a little longer
But if I fall, you fall too
Before I believe it's true

[Chorus]
Yeah, Before I believe in you and me
Before I let my heart go free
Tell me that you need me like I need you
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true

But I've known for so long now
How love can change you
Baby please confess
The love has changed you too
Before I believe it's true

[Chorus]
Yeah, Before I believe in you and me
Before I let my heart go free
Tell me that you that want me like I want you
Yeah before you see what no one sees
Before I let my heart go free
Tell me that you need me like I need you
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true
