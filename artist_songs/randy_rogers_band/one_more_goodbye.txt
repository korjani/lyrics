Baby, I know it's late
But I just couldn't sleep
I got up to go for a drive

And I would up on your street
I know that we said we shouldn't do this anymore
Ah, but lonely is prone to forget
So, I'm standing at your door
Well, maybe it's not right
Maybe that don't matter tonight

[Chorus:]
How 'bout one more goodbye
Play with fire just one more time
Let it burn till the morning light
And let it fade away
Girl, we don't even have to pretend
We ain't going back to where we've been
We both know it's not worth another try
But how 'bout one more goodbye

I know we'll regret
If you let me in
We can ask for forgiveness tomorrow
If you stay in my arms until then
We don't have to be alone
I don't care if it's wrong

[Repeat Chorus]

Girl, we don't even have to pretend
We ain't going back to where we've been
We both know it's not worth another try
We both know it's not worth another try
But it's worth one more goodbye
But it's worth one more goodbye
How 'bout one more goodbye
