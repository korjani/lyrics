These walls, they used to be our home
You and me and everything we had, we had it all
And nothing could compare, who would even dare

I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
No, I don't deserve you

All these photographs of the times we had
It kills me to look back knowing how I've changed all that
Why did I change all that

And I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
No, I don't deserve you

I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
On me and you
Give up, I don't wanna give up
Don't wanna have to

I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
No, I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
I don't deserve you
(Give up, I don't wanna give up)
I don't deserve you...
