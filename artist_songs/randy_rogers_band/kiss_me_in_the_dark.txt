Sailors sail
Cowboys ride
Lovers love when they get the chance
Take it slow
Turn down the light
Soft and low
Let the shadows dance 
Baby don't hold back

[Chorus:]
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go 
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Lets strip away everything 
Tonight theres nothing getting in our way
The ties that bind, the wheres and whys
Take em off and leave them all outside
Lock it all outside

[Chorus:]
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Without a single a word
Baby we can say so much
Reveal everything with just one touch
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss me in the dark
Yeahhhh
