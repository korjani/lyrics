Well, here we go again with the back and forth
Trying to open up the same closed door
Well, I wear my pride, you hide your pain
We both know there's no winning
But we still play the game

[Chorus:]
If I told you that I need you
Would you run or stay with me?
Would you steal my heart again and set me free?
If I told you I would never leave you
Would you come unglued?
What would you do?
If I told you the truth

Some old reasons, same excuses and lies
We've said it all before with the same goodbye
I can't let you leave me
You won't let me go
Before we do this again, there's something you ought to know

[Repeat Chorus]

And I can't take away the past
But I can't give up on us
I just hope that all I am will someday be enough 

[Repeat Chorus]

What would you do?
If I told you the truth
