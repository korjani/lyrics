I'm gonna fight 'em off, 
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back, 
They're gonna rip it off, 
Taking their time right behind my back.

And I'm talking to myself at night, because I can't forget, 
Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette.

And a message coming from my eyes says 'leave it alone', 
No, leave it alone, 
Says leave it alone, 
Oh leave it alone.
Don't wanna hear about it, 
Every single one's got a story to tell, 
Everyone knows about it, 
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell.

And if I catch you coming back my way, 
I'm gonna sell it to you, yeah, 
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do.

And a feeling coming from my bones, says 'find a home', 
Oh, find a home, 
Find a home.

I'm gonna fight 'em off, 
Seven nation army couldn't hold me back, 
They're gonna rip it off.

And a feeling coming from my bones, says 'find a home', 
Find a home, 
Go back home, 
Go back home, 
You better go back home!
