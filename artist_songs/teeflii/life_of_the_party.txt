[Chorus - Kevin McCall Teeflii:]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me

[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
Bout that life, yeah you know what it is, what it is
I'm the reason that you on [?] and that you on the map
Legs shaking from me putting it down
In the shower for some hours
I like to see, I like to see you put on

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
Late night sex, early mornings
I'm your drug, girl I keep you up
Make it do what it do
Let's go have fun now baby

[Chorus - Kevin McCall Teeflii:]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me

[Verse 2 - Teeflii:]
Wrestling with your body all night long
In your sexy lingerie
You could get my super soaker
Got that right conversation
You say everything I need to hear
Baby just don't keep me waiting
I'm tryna leave, leave the keys under the door mat

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
Late night sex, early mornings
I'm your drug, girl I keep you up
Make it do what it do
Let's go have fun now baby

[Chorus - Kevin McCall Teeflii:]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
