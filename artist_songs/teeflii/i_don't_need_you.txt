[Intro:]
See me and my Annie got a understanding that's so good. 
That an misunderstanding in this is understood. You finding me?

[Chorus - TeeFlii:]
Girl, I don't need you
I don't need you
No, I don't
A little bit just won't do
A little bit just won't do
I don't need you
No, no, no, I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
No, I don't need you

[Verse 1 - TeeFlii:]
You causing stress, shit is a mess
I really thought you loved me, but you really don't love me
I'm watching your actions, but they ain't the right actions
You won't catch me outside it
Girl, I do it just how a thug supposed to do it

[Pre-Chorus:]
But you playing these games like a Playstation 4
[?]
There ain't no right from wrong
You better stop acting dumb, recognize what you got
Cause, I, I

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - TeeFlii:]
You causing drama
Got two baby mamas that already cause me drama
You can't be [?]
But I'm like fuck it, life ain't never been fair
That's right, I trust my niggas way more than I trust you bitches
I thought that you loved me, but you loved me in a wrong way

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Dom Kennedy (TreeFlii):]
Learn how to cook first then try to tell me how to do my job
I've been here every night
For the last five years with the car or a bike
Start getting nice
I just wanna stay out of trouble
You can't always be humble
Man, I'm just trying to carry the rock
And niggas wanna see me fumble and it's hard getting old
[?]
And I don't wanna be on the phone this much
Oh yeah, I'm sure, this might be the fifth tour
Really ain't home too much
I'm on niggas like a bus pass for the hate that they must have
Thirty thou in the duf bag, girl with a plump ass
Smell the weed when we come past
Car service when we come past, I don't need you
(Go ahead tell motherfuckers what have you done)
Never have, never will
See me switch lanes in a Benz for real
Should have a movie like the Man of Steel
Or have a movie like Fade to Black
Get your homegirl, she a fan for real
[?] two chickens how it's supposed to go
They had to get down on their hands and heel

[Chorus]
