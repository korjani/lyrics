[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
Finally put that money where your mouth is
Annie make that nigga put in work
Michael Jackson with all of them [?]
Calling me daddy, I'm tryna flip em
Don't give a damn about who you came with
Cause when you leave, you leaving with me
You the type that's gon' keep up your figure
Girl I'm a beast, you missing a picture

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
I'm a make it rain on her
I'm a make it rain on her
Get in there deep for you baby
I tear that pussy up, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
She around me, she roll my weed up

[Chorus - Teeflii:]
Light it up
She light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
She light it up, light it up
She light it up, light it up

[Verse 2 - Jelly Roll:]
Ballin' and these niggas muggin in the pussy's hair
Don't you dummies know money make em twerk
[?] with these panties and I'm tryna rip em
These bitches they hear are shit and get turnt
Be in the club with $3, 000 jeans on and $300 shirts
Bitches they shake they ass and they titties on me, I ain't even gotta flirt

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
I'm a make it rain on her
I'm a make it rain on her
Get in there deep for you baby
I tear that pussy up, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
She around me, she roll my weed up

[Chorus - Teeflii:]
Light it up
She light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
She light it up, light it up
She light it up, light it up
