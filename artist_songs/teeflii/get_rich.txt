[Pre-Chorus:]
Get it how you live it
Don't no other girls do it like you
Annie you put it down
You know your body be off the chain
You could be my favorite girl
Just keep acting a fool
See I know your nigga can't stand me
He know I don't play around

[Chorus:]
And he live a little, live a lot
You your crease always A1, girl you know you 'bout ot
Cause you so, you so fine, you tryna be mine
You dancing like you tryna get rich
Tryna get rich
Your dancing like you tryna get rich
Like you tryna get rich

[Verse:]
You don't need to be working a 9-5
And you be working, you be working all damn night
You sex me just like you sex me in your fantasies
I'm everything you want, I got this shit on lock
Got this shit on lock
Stumbling over everybody cause we've been drinking
I ain't worried about nobody, I'm just worried about my Grammys
Your nigga should have never brought you here
If he don't know you tryna sturn up
Got game fucked up

[Chorus:]
And he live a little, live a lot
You your crease always A1, girl you know you 'bout ot
Cause you so, you so fine, you tryna be mine
You dancing like you tryna get rich
Tryna get rich
Your dancing like you tryna get rich
Like you tryna get rich

[Pre-Chorus:]
Get it how you live it
Don't no other girls do it like you
Annie you put it down
You know your body be off the chain
You could be my favorite girl
Just keep acting a fool
See I know your nigga can't stand me
He know I don't play around

[Chorus:]
And he live a little, live a lot
You your crease always A1, girl you know you 'bout ot
Cause you so, you so fine, you tryna be mine
You dancing like you tryna get rich
Tryna get rich
Your dancing like you tryna get rich
Like you tryna get rich
