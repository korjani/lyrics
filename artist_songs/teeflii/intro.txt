[Verse:]
I told you I got it, don't worry
This how we do it in South Central
You know the stunting be real over here
Cause we have sex the way you like
See I'm a pound that shit all night
We go round and round, oh yeah
I bet that bad pussy don't behave
Keep talking to me dirty babe
Just let me see your work all in your sexy lingerie
Annie take all of your clothes off
Annie take all of your clothes off
Show me baby, show me girl

[Chorus:]
Your exotic body
Show me your exotic body
Show me your exotic body
Show me your exotic body
