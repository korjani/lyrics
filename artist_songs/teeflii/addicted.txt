[Hook:]
Let's have a lil Henny, refill your cup
Tonight we wanna have it, only one fuck
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
We all on the floor, showin' ah-ah
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
You gon' get addicted, yeah

[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
Round and round, can I trade places with you?
Goin' up and down, yeah yeah-yeah
I'll let you ride it if you just climb on top
Don't stop fo' nothin', Annie, do what you do, yeah
I ain't playin' with you, girl
When we bumpin' and grindin', oh, all night

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg:]
Another cold one, girl, now you want me
Listen here, Annie, yo girl been on me
Annie, are ya walkin'? You say that you couldn't be
Fly as a muthafucka, bitches is on me
Crenshaw District, look at what we did here
Now I'm in the Valley, fuckin' with a rich bitch
Swing, bada-bing, bada-bong
Seen with a G, gotta go
Baby girl, he ain't gotta know
I keep it all the way, undercover light
It show you another life
Get prepared to be whipped, spooned and gloved
Dip the flare (?!) with my dick

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Dj Quik:]
I'm a go in like the first firemen on the scene
'S a way to chill the smoke, nahwimean?
I wanna have a straight menage a troix
Both 'em pussies fat like some Foie gras
The way I talk to the pussy like a toddler
I say coochie coochie coo, then I gobble 'er
I got a lotta lights, but this my favorite review
Leave eyes to her hips and let her hair show through
And even if that pussy's got a lil whif
I'm a still take it and treat it like a gift
I'm addicted, I stopped and went down and licked it
Kick back on a shrub, because the pussy's a drug

[Hook]
