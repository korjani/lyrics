[Chorus - Teeflii:]
Annie pull up a chair and I'll take you there
I wanna see all the tricks you got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Yeah, give it up, give it up
Your rotations got me on, we can do it all night long
Tryna see all the tricks you've got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Annie, take me, hold tight

[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
The way you was twerking I had to grab you Annie
Get on my lip, I move, you move, you ride me slowly
Better tell your nigga, why you didn't answer none of his calls
Cause you was being good, pleasing body
Freaky on the late nights how you pop that ass
Cause when you grinding you sure look good to me
Scratch me, grind me, pull me, do whatever, Annie get it done
Kiss me, hold me, please me, I promise we can do this all night

[Chorus - Teeflii (Jeremih):]
Annie pull up a chair and I'll take you there
I wanna see all the tricks you got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
(Give it up)
Yeah, give it up, give it up
Your rotations got me on, we can do it all night long
(All night long)
Tryna see all the tricks you've got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Annie, baby, hold tight

[Verse 2 - Jeremih:]
It's the time, the time, If you're mine, girl I'm fine
So fine, I don't mind
When you're high on that pole I wanna get you low
When you're looking back at me, get an extra two strokes
And I'm stroking on your butter love, butter love
Despite a nigga saying, make me lap your stage as you're stirring up, stirring up, stirring up
And I know y'all understand the game we're here to play
With these treats that I'm gon' give you, holla when you show me all them tricks
You don't mean no picture, you the baddest bitch
All in them positions, pose like shit we did was a picture
Prices, she ride it like it's no license
She blowin' all on me like Dysons

[Chorus - Teeflii:]
Annie pull up a chair and I'll take you there
I wanna see all the tricks you got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Yeah, give it up, give it up
Your rotations got me on, we can do it all night long
Tryna see all the tricks you've got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Annie take me hold tight

[Verse 3 - Teeflii:]
You ain't gotta rush cause we've got all night baby
So take you're time baby
Cause you came right home
Beautiful, can I show you something
Fill me up, I've been waiting for you
To put it down
So stay focused and keep them eyes right on me

[Chorus - Teeflii:]
Annie pull up a chair and I'll take you there
I wanna see all the tricks you got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Yeah, give it up, give it up
Your rotations got me on, we can do it all night long
Tryna see all the tricks you've got
Give me a lap dance, yeah, give me a lap dance
Annie, baby, hold tight
