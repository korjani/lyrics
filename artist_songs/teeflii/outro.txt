I said Teeflii baby, killing next
Niggas on the line, fuck the call, read the text
DJ Telli motherfucker, nigga read the vest
We run L.A. Like marathon, so in other word, we west
[?] was at demonstration
She showed thata little prosper can lead, stimulation
AD was my motivation
This slap job cold world left you niggas in temptation
Shit we do, yeah so amazing
Black cards, swimming pools and sports cars
Here's where we're aiming
[?] boy, that my motherfucker
His beef is my beef, that's a lesson to you mah'fuckers
And I was tired of being sick and tired
So it was time to put Ferrari [?] on my tyres
And to show em all my chain was collosal size
With a [?] squeeze, for the macho guys
Yeah smoking on that stone greed
The curt won't hold green, grabbing my swishers
Sweet cheese to ease my thoughts
And I use this pain to express my passion
Tom Brady grind, is he [?] king for passing
And I don't know shit, so niggas stop asking
2 words for you broke niggas, stop lacking
Excuse my motherfucking liquor nigga
