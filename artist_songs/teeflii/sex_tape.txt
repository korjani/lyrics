[Intro:]
Here's a lesson that I'm tryna teach you
Here's a lesson that I'm tryna teach you

[Chorus:]
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon'
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
You be filming all
Our sex tape, sex tape
We gon' make a, we gon' make a
Sex tape, sex tape

[Verse 1:]
Girl don't you see what I see
We're sexing in the mirror
Barking like it's nothing Annie, you know you won't take
It's written all over your face

[Pre-Chorus:]
I see that you trippin' off that [?] but you ain't got to say a word
You know I don't do it like these other niggas
I'm gon' please your body

[Chorus:]
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon'
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
You be filming all
Our sex tape, sex tape
We gon' make a, we gon' make a
Sex tape, sex tape

[Verse 2:]
Annie go ahead and lay, let me take off all of your clothes
Let me see you bend over, touch your toes

[Pre-Chorus:]
I see that you trippin' off that [?] but you ain't got to say a word
You know I don't do it like these other niggas
I'm gon' please your body

[Chorus:]
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon'
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
You be filming all
Our sex tape, sex tape
We gon' make a, we gon' make a
Sex tape, sex tape

[Bridge:]
It's written all over your face but you ain't got to say a word
It's written all over your face but you ain't got to say a word

[Chorus:]
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon'
Sex tape, we gon' make a sex tape
You be filming all
Our sex tape, sex tape
We gon' make a, we gon' make a
Sex tape, sex tape

[Outro:]
Here's a lesson that I'm tryna teach you
Here's a lesson that I'm tryna teach you
