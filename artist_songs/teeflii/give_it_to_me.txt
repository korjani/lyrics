[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
You wearin' that dress, gettin' ratchet
You goin' up down, up down
Yeah, sit that pussy on my face
Young nigga but I don't play
Show me what that 'bout
I can give you rounds 'til you tap out

[Pre-Hook - Teeflii:]
Dick too bomb, let me beat it 'til it's numb
Annie you a bad bitch
I can make you do it, make you do it

[Hook - Teeflii:]
Girl don't lie, we gon' have sex
All night, all night
You gon' give it to me, you gon' give it to me
You gon' give it to me, put that thing on me
You gon' give it to me, you gon' give it to me
I'm all up on your body and you' give it to me
Cause you're wearin' that dress

[Verse 2 - Teeflii:]
Gettin' ratchet
You goin' up down, up down
Baddest bitch on the floor
You fuck around and get it, get it, get it crackin'
You turn around and let 'em see you're ass shake
Don't be trippin' cause everybody got a little ratchet in 'em

[Pre-Hook] 

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - E-40:]
I can sell a square, a O
I can sell a information person the commercial
Let my [?] unravel and go to work
Free the nipple, go to work
Baby got back but yours is fatter
I'm tryna smack it up and flip it like a spatula
Ever since I can remember I've been a benefactor
And my manipulation for my masters, degree
Touch your toes
I'm on your line like a telephone pole
Give it to me
Get live, let me see a show
Shake it like jello in a tupperware bowl
Bitch

[Hook x2]
