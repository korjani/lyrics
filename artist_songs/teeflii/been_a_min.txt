[Intro:]
Nigga I've been living good
I can tell that I'm your type
You're moving your hips, you move it right

[Chorus:]
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you had something good
It's been a minute, been a minute
It's been a while since you showed some freaky
It's been a minute, been a minute
Body tatted up, I know you with it
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you wore that dress
It's been a minute, been a minute
Showed off that body
It's been a minute, been a minute
Yeah, it's been a minute, been a minute

[Verse 1:]
Your body that's my party
You on top you ride me
Girl get money
You been working in the gym, doing them squats
Girl give me what you got
That sexy, you throwin' it, I'm gon' catch it

[Pre-Chorus:]
Got your lipstick all over my jacket, and over in my pocket
I put that on the hood, you with it
Bad bitch, pretty

[Chorus:]
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you had something good
It's been a minute, been a minute
It's been a while since you showed some freaky
It's been a minute, been a minute
Body tatted up, I know you with it
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you wore that dress
It's been a minute, been a minute
Showed off that body
It's been a minute, been a minute
Yeah, it's been a minute, been a minute

[Verse 2:]
Don't trust that ho, any you nigga make love to her
Then he thinking that he pimpin', niggas ain't winning
Taking loss after loss, hoping that I put you on
I killed that pussy you can't feel it
You done, you could put a fork in it

[Pre-Chorus:]
Got your lipstick all over my jacket, and over in my pocket
I put that on the hood, you with it
Bad bitch, pretty

[Chorus:]
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you had something good
It's been a minute, been a minute
It's been a while since you showed some freaky
It's been a minute, been a minute
Body tatted up, I know you with it
It's been a minute, been a minute
Since you wore that dress
It's been a minute, been a minute
Showed off that body
It's been a minute, been a minute
Yeah, it's been a minute, been a minute

[Outro:]
I could tell that I'm your type
Your moving your heels, you moving right
I could tell that I'm your type
Your moving your heels, you moving right
