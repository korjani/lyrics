One thing is that you know is that I'm trying to get you

[Verse 3: Yea Dat]
Look, I'm like "All I know is this ratchet"

She don't do gymnastics but she be doing backflips
When I put that D in her cause I put it deep in her
EML girl we be on some ratchet shit
Trying to turn a classy chick into a ratchet bitch
Codeine sipper baby I'm an activist
And I beat that pussy up on some active shit
Damn Annie look at all that ass and shit
Make a nigga wanna hit it from the back and shit
Whole team winning baby like tag we it
Finna' change my name to air cause I'm maxin' shit
