[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Of Hennessy and weed
Come and and have a drink with me
Of Hennessy and weed
Hell yeah, girl
Girl, we gon' get high, we gon' get high tonight
Of Hennessy and weed, Hennessy and weed
Hennessy and weed, of Hennessy and weed
Hennessy and weed, Hennessy and weed

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
First off, let me get it
Don't be scared, let me hit it
You gon' tell your best friend, Keisha
Shit, every single thing that we did
Checking out your thighs, you're a thicky
And the look that's inside your eyes, you want me
Damn right, this sticky spot, it ain't no tit for tat
Smoking on that bong, we on cloud five

[Pre-Chorus: TeeFlii]
Excuse, yes, excuse my liquor
Middle finger to you if you do not get the picture
Go on and get it, girl, no
Yeah, we the shit
They hating cause know they can't do it like us

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
Tell 'em get up on that ladder
They jocking our crease
Drinking on a bottle 'til it's gone
That's why we really don't really know how to act
What's up, what's up, what's up, baby, is you with it?
Cause you got all that sexy shit on
You've been patiently waiting
But now I'm gonna satisfy your body

[Pre-Chorus: TeeFlii]
Excuse, yes, excuse my liquor
Middle finger to you if you do not get the picture
Yeah, we the shit
Your girls hating cause they can't do it like us

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Now say what you say
I ain't got time, but I got cake
I got weed, I got drank
And I'll be on my way
I come through, but I can't stay
I'm out here trying to crack this safe
You know I hate to wait
You know I'll take you to that place
To drink this yak and smoke an eight
Ain't the type to chase
I mean, I like my Henny straight
I'll probably wife your pretty face
Know a nigga drunk, that's just the type of shit I say
You kissing on your homegirl, that type of shit is gay
Just having fun though, so baby, it's okay
Hennessy and weed'll leave to these type of days

[Chorus]
