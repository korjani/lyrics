I was on the edge of falling off the pages for me
Start to feel like I was lost in a different plot of a different story
Dark side, ain't gonna steal my sunlight, I start to feel like
Get the notion that I still got my whole life
Just waiting for me, waiting for me

I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I want my face in the daylight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
The clouds will come when the dark goes through
The past can't stay, it's gonna pass right through
I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it

Let me, let me, let me go find the light of day, go and chase these clouds away
Let me, let me go hear the sunlight say, I'm gonna chase these clouds away
Dark side, ain't gonna steal my sunlight, I start to feel like
Let me, let me go hear the sunlight say
It's just waiting for me, waiting for me

I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I want my face in the daylight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
The clouds will come when the dark goes through
The past can't stay, it's gonna pass right through
I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it

I got the dark disposition
Trying to find my own demolition
To chase these clouds away
I ain't asking for no ones permission
To find myself a sunnier position
To chase these clouds away
Chase these clouds away

I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I want my face in the daylight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
The clouds will come when the dark goes through
The past can't stay, it's gonna pass right through
I want my place in the sunlight
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it

I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it
