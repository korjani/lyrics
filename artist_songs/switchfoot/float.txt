OK, let's do it

Turn it up so I can feel it
Turn it up so I can be near it
Baby says she's got that feeling
Moonwalking on the ceiling

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, all alright

Turn it up so I can feel it
Loud enough so I can get near it
Baby's in that slow emotion
Moonwalking on the ocean

It's how we float, yeah
Feet ain't even touching ground
It's how we float, yeah
Flying at the speed of sound
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it
It's how we float, yeah
We ain't never coming down

Don't you need someone to lean on?
Don't you need that taste of freedom?
It don't take no education
All you need's an invitation

It's alright
It's alright, all alright

It's how we float, yeah
Feet ain't even touching ground
It's how we float, yeah
Flying at the speed of sound
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it
It's how we float, yeah
We ain't never coming down

Away from the crowds where you realize
The herd's insecure or the free mind
So don't let em tell you what to feel like
They can't bring me down, can't bring me down, yeah
Money gonna run away hardest
Money gonna leave you broken-hearted
But money can't finish what we started
It can't bring me down, can't bring me down, yeah
(It's how we float, yeah)

It's how we float, yeah (in orbit)
Feet ain't even touching ground
It's how we float (orbit), yeah
Flying at the speed of sound
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it (it's how we, how we)
It's how we float, yeah
We ain't never coming down

It's how we float, yeah
Feet ain't even touching ground (it's how we float)
It's how we float, yeah
Flying at the speed of sound (it's how we float in orbit)
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot (it's how we float in orbit, yeah)
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it
It's how we float, yeah
We ain't never coming down
