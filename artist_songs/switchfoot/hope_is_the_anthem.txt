Sometimes what you need is what you fight
Like a wounded man out on the run
Like shadows hiding from the light
But your love is what I was running from

Hope's a seed you have to sow
When you let it go it comes to life
So you stretch your arrows on the bow
And you pull them back and watch them fly

My heartbeat, my oxygen
My banner, my home
My future, my song
Your hope is the anthem of my soul

My lungs and I were born to fight
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm fighting for
But death ain't the only end in sight
Cause this ain't a battle it's a lifelong war

My heartbeat, my oxygen
My banner, my home
My freedom, my song
Your hope is the anthem of my soul

Your hope is the anthem of my soul

My heart is beating like a blown speaker
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weaker
A distortion pedal and a pair of wings
And an anthem played on broken strings

My heartbeat, my oxygen
My banner, my home
My future, my song
Your hope is the anthem
Your hope is the anthem of my soul

Your hope is the anthem of my soul
Your hope is the anthem of my soul
Your hope is the anthem of my soul
Your hope is the anthem of my soul

Yeah could you make me whole?
(like holy water)
