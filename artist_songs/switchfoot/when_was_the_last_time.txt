Give me a little time to sink
My footsteps on the brink
My girl says that she's freaking out
And I'm not sure what I can think
And I'm thinking

My heart keeps skipping the beats
And my peace feels out of reach
And I wish I could say that the world's gone crazy
But it feels like it's just me
And it's been so long

"Mama, ain't I normal?"
It's been so long
"Mama, ain't I normal?"

When was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?

And let go
And let go
And let go
And let go

Life is already difficult
But I'd rather be happy than typical
The crowd ain't hardly subliminal
But I'm the one living, no?
And it's been so long

"Mama, ain't I normal?"
It's been so long
"Mama, ain't I normal?"

When was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?

And let go

When was the last time you did
Something that made you feel like a kid
Laughing just like we did
When we were just the little ones 
It's been so long

When was the last time we held
Hands underneath the stars as they fell
Laughing hard at ourselves
When we were just the little ones
It's been so long
It's been so long

"Mama, ain't I normal?"
"Mama, ain't I normal?"

When was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
I said, when was the last time that you felt alive?
Singing when was the last time you tried something for the first time?
