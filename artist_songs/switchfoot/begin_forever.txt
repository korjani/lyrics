Yeah

Like blood without a heart
Like a race without a start
Like a submarine stranded on the shore
Like a plane without the wings
A piano without strings
Like a memory we've forgotten what it's for

Maybe we lost the plot, maybe gotten stuck
Well I'm holding on to what we got, I'm not giving up

It's never to late to try
It's never to late to finally find a way to make you right
Happily ever
I don't need no alibis
I just need you by my side
I'm telling you one more time
It's never to late to begin forever

Yeah, like a telephone line with nobody left to call
Like I'm living in a home that's got no roof at all
Like a man who won the world and lost his soul
Yeah, without wonder, how could life ever be wonderful

Yeah

But it's never to late to try
It's never to late to finally find a way to make you right
Happily ever
I don't need no alibis
I just need you by my side
I'm telling you one more time
It's never to late to begin forever

What's it worth if it costs you all your hope?
You and me, we got stories to unfold

Like a hammer without a nail
Like a ship without a sail
Like I'm all dressed up, but nowhere left to go

Without you, without you, it means nothing, nothing
Without you, without you, it means nothing
Yeah

It's never to late to try
It's never to late to finally find a way to make you right
Happily ever
I don't need nothing money could buy
I just need you by my side
I'm telling you one more time
It's never to late to begin forever

It's never to late to try
It's never to late to try
It's never to late to try
We could begin forever
It's never to late to try
Yeah
It's never to late to try
Begin forever
