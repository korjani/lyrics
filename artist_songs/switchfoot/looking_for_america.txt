[Lecrae & Switchfoot:]
Land of the free, home of the brave
But Lord knows that we need plenty change
‘Cause plenty chains in the past leaving deep scars
But when the sun come down we gonna be stars

The doors are locked where they once stood open
A wound of fear where we once stood hoping
The shattered glass where the bullets broke in
I'm looking for the place that I was born
I'm looking for a way to fix what's torn
I'm looking for America

I'm looking for America

Yeah, you know
Beaten red white and blue for the green we pursue
I’m still looking for you

[Switchfoot:]
America who are you?
Underneath the red blue and white?
America who are you?
I wonder who you are tonight
America who are you?
Is God still on your side?
I want to see a nation rise above the fear and fight that haunts these streets tonight

I'm looking for America
I’m looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I’m looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I’m looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America

America who are you?
Am I asking for too much
America who are you?
Has your dream become out of touch
America who are you?
Do you get what you deserve
Between the violence and entitlements
Which nation do you serve?

I'm looking for America
I’m looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I’m looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I’m looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America

I’m singing
Farewell my utopia
Farewell my euphoria
Fare thee well my suburban day-dream
Farewell my utopia

[Lecrae:]
America you so pretty
But you not perfect
Confession of guilt is worth it
These people hurting deserve it
Blood on your hands I saw
When there’s blood on this nations floor
But it’s blood on the upper post of your door
If you need to know

I’m looking for your honesty in skeletons
Do away with your ignorance and arrogance
America the land of immigrants
Check the green card and pedigree
Bless the Choctaw and the Cherokee
That we’ll never see

[Switchfoot:]
I'm looking for America
I’m looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I’m looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I’m looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America

[Lecrae & Switchfoot:]
The land of the free, home of the brave
But Lord knows we need plenty change
I’m looking for America
Plenty chains in the past left deep scars
But when the sun come down we gonna be stars
And may the stripes heal when it’s through
Beaten red white blue for the green that we pursue

I’m looking for America
