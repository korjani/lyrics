I'm on a roll
I'm feeling Icarus
I might have flown too high
I'm not alone
I'm feeling Icarus
I might have flown too high

Adrianna, I hope you found what you were looking for, looking for
Adrianna, I hope you found what you were looking for, looking for

Pick up the phone
Please tell me anything
You might have flown too high
My bird has flown
Please tell me anything
You might have flown too high

Adrianna, I hope you found what you were looking for, looking for
Adrianna, I hope you found what you were looking for, looking for

On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light with the heavy heart
On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light and heavy, light and heavy, light and heavy

This is your torch to carry
More than just a cross to bury down
None of us are ordinary
A beating heart is light and heavy 

Adrianna, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for
Adrianna, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for

Light and heavy
