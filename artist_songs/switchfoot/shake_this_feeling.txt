I can’t seem to shake this feeling
That we both could break through that ceiling
And there’s a look in your eyes and I’m not surprised
And I’m wishing that we could start all over again

I get the feeling that we’re losing heart
Heart, heart
Harder to keep it than it was to start
Start, start
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I can’t seem to shake this feeling

The words came out like a landslide
What you can’t take back keeps you up at night
And it’s hard to fly when your wings are tied
And I’m wishing that we could start all over again
Yeah, start it over again

I get the feeling that we’re losing heart
Heart, heart
Harder to keep it than it was to start
Start, start
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I keep feeling like we fall apart
And then we got to fight to fall back in love again

And I can’t seem to shake this feeling
No, I can’t seem to shake this feeling
Well, maybe it’s time to start healing?

I wonder when did I lose your heart
Your heart, your heart?
And whether we can go back to the start
The start, the start?
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I keep feeling like we fall apart
And then we got to fight to fall back in love again

And I can’t seem to shake this feeling

We both started with a broken heart
Admit there’s a problem that’s a start
And I want to start healing, healing

‘Cause everybody wants to rock and roll
But a couple of years and it takes a toll
And I wanna start healing, healing

And I can’t seem to shake this feeling
Oh I can’t seem to shake this feeling
