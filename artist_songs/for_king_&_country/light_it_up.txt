Sunset stole the light
That colored in your eyes
And everything in sight
Was lost in silhouette
You're lost in silhouette

Light it up and let it go
Don't you see that you are not alone?
Light it up and watch it fly
Cause you can go anywhere you want tonight

Light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up

I could wear the weight
And take it all the way
But every creature's fate
Is theirs and theirs alone
It's Yours and Yours alone

So light it up and let it go
Don't you see that you are not alone?
Light it up and watch it fly
Cause you can go anywhere you want tonight

So light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up and watch it fly
Cause you could be anything you want tonight

Cause it could be a beautiful morning
Yes, it can be a beautiful morning

Everything you never said,
And all the things you thought instead
And everyone you never knew,
And everywhere you're going to
And every song you wanna sing,
And every smile as it begins,
It's yours and yours alone
Yes it's yours and yours alone
Instead it's yours and yours alone

So light it up and let it go
Don't you see that you are not alone?
Just light it up and watch it fly
Cause you can go anywhere you want tonight

Light it up and let it go
Don't you see that you are not alone?
Light it up and watch it fly
Cause you can be anything you want tonight

It could be a beautiful morning
It could be a beautiful morning
Cause it could be a beautiful morning
