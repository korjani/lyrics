This is where it begins
This is where all the worry ends
This is where I say I don't need to have control

This is where I admit
I don't know how to handle it
Life in all of this chaos
You're my only hope
And all that I have to offer
Is the white flag of surrender

So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning
To the place You are
And if You want to take me over the edge
I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land
Wanna be right where You are,
In the middle of Your heart

This is what I believe
That if I give you my everything
I will become who I was really born to be

I'll stand up and say it
Yeah, Your love is something I can put my faith in

So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning
To the place You are
And if You wanna take me over the edge
I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land
Wanna be right where You are,
In the middle of Your heart

What I carry...
What I carry...
But now I can let it go
Yeah I carry it
Lord I carry it
But now I can let it go
Yeah I can let it go

So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning
To the place You are
And if You wanna take me over the edge
I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land
Wanna be right where You are,
In the middle of Your heart

The middle of Your heart
