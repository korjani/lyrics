Shepherds bowing in the moonlight
Angels dancing in the night sky
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

Mary smiling at the manger
Tears spilling on a saviour
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

For unto us a child is born

He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

We have been guarded by a baby
Every man and every lady
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

A wonder like we've never seen
A wonder like we've never seen
A wonder like we've never seen, praise be to You only
A wonder like we've never seen, praise be to You only

He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us

(It's so) Glorious
(He is) Glorious
(Yeah) Glory this is God with us
Glory this is God with us
