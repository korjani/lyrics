Ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song

Glo-ria, in excelsis Deo
Glo-ria(in excelsis in excelsis in excelsis Deo)
In excelsis Deo

See Him in the manger lay
Whom the choir of angels praise
Mary Joseph lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise

Glo-ria(in excelsis in excelsis in excelsis Deo)
In excelsis Deo
Glo-ria(in excelsis in excelsis in excelsis Deo)
In excelsis Deo

Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord newborn King
(The newborn, newborn King)
