If hope is what you're after
I can take it and turn it into rain

Your tears become laughter
I will catch them and turn them back again
Yeah I will catch them and twist them back again

When you're upside down, then you see it all
That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door

You made a plan
You think you're in control
Yeah, you're flying
But you're way too high to fall
And hey man
Check around the corner
Because it's coming
Here's your wakeup call

Don't hear Me coming?
I'm your wakeup call

When you're upside down, then you see it all
Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before
When you're upside down, then you see it all
That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door

I will shake you
I will make your shattered dreams unwind
Because it's only when it comes to pieces
Only then is time increases
You will find the peace that you've been dying for
You'll realize that all this time
You've been pushing on a pull door
You've been pushing on a pull door

Upside down, then you see it all
Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before
Oh you know, when you're upside down, then you see it all
That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door
(Yeah, pushing on a pull door)

When you're upside down, then you see it all
Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before
(Pushing on a pull door, pushing on a pull door)
When you're upside down, then you see it all
(You're upside down)
That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door
Hey, pushing on a pull door

You've been pushing on a pull door
