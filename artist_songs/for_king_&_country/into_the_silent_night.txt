The snow is falling like I am for you
Hear the children singing one of our favorite tunes
Christmas trees, nativities
See the world in red and green

Into the silent night
With you by my side
Joy in a lonesome world
For this boy and girl
Angels celebrate
As we stand face to face
With God's gift tonight
You and I

If you couldn't tell darling
I only have eyes for you
After rain seasons change
Till Christmas day comes back again
Love remains

Into the silent night
With you by my side
Joy in a lonesome world
For this boy and girl
Angels celebrate
As we stand face to face
With God's gift tonight
You and I

Sun and rain
Life and change
But through it all
Love remains

Into the silent night
With you by my side
Joy in a lonesome world
For this boy and girl
Angels celebrate
As we stand face to face
With God's gift tonight

Into the silent night
With you by my side
Joy in a lonesome world
For this boy and girl
Angels celebrate
As we stand face to face
With God's gift tonight
You and I
