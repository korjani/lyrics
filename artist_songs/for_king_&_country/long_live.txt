If you’re playing that drum but you got no rhythm
If you’re a little out of key but you’re always singing

If you’re so carefree but so not careless
Such a wreck, but ain't love wreck-less
If you’re listening I hope you hear this

[Chorus:]
Long live the young at heart
You know who you are
With your spirit burning
Take a risk and take a chance
Carry on
Long live the soul set free
Don't be afraid to dream
While the world’s still turning
Every moment, make it happen
With two left feet
Keep on dancing

Beat by beat
Breath by breath
Walking hand in hand
Step by step

With drop of faith and childlike wonder
You can weather the lighting, you can brave the thunder

No road map, but keep on running
No parachute, but keep on jumping
Oh, I think you might be onto something

[Chorus]

Beat by beat
Breath by breath
Walking hand in hand
Step by step
Here and now
Day by day
Won’t let this memory slip away

[Chorus]

Every moment, make it happen
With two left feet
Keep on dancing

Beat by beat
Breath by breath
Walking hand in hand
Step by step
