Wanna tell you I'm alright
Wanna say I'm not in pain
But I would just be telling lies
I'm not okay
I'm not okay

Wanna travel back in time
Say the things I didn't say
I wanna tell you everything
If it's not too late
Is it too late?

Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change

Stay awake and talk to me
Let me hold you while you sleep
I've been out here on my own
But you're my home
You're my home

Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change

I'm not gonna let you down this time
Darling, don't be afraid

People change
And I can change

Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change
People change
People change
