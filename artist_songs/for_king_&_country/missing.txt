I threw your picture in the fire
I watched you melt away
You turned to smoke, you burned my eyes
But I couldn't escape
My love for you remains
So why was I afraid?

When you were next to me,
Why didn't I tell you?
You were so good to me
Why didn't I just take back everything I said to you?
And take back everything I put you through?
Why didn't I tell you?

They said we never would survive
And I believed the lies
And then their words were verified
When I replaced my heart for your demise
But you were always on the side

When you were next to me,
Why didn't I tell you?
You were so good to me
Why didn't I just take back everything I said to you?
And take back everything I put you through?
Why didn't I tell you?

I love the way you understand,
The way you love,
The way you were when no one was looking 
That you were beautiful and you were worth it all
You were everything I need
You captured my attention,
Did I mention I think you're beautiful, darling?
If I could tell you now,
I'd tell you how the world is dark now that you're missing
Now that you're missing

When you were next to me,
Why didn't I tell you?
You were so good to me
And why didn't I just take back everything I said to you?
And take back everything I put you through?
Why didn't I tell you?

I love the way you understand,
The way you love,
The way you were
Why didn't I tell you?
That you were beautiful 
And you were worth it all
So why didn't I tell you?
You captured my attention, did I mention?
So why didn't I tell you?
That you were beautiful
That you were worth it all
So why didn't I tell you?

If I could tell you now
I'd say I love you
