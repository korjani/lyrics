Black hole in a broken heart
Took your innocence and left a scar
Crossed lines and crushed your world
And tore your soul in two

Too young to knock your door
Trapped in this uncivil war
Too much to comprehend
What this could make of you

Let it echo
Is it waiting
To determine what will become?

You will be safe
You will be free
This won't decide who you're gonna be
You will be safe
You will be new
The cycle will break
The future will change
And you will be sane

Scared that your secret might come out
And you're gonna lose the life you got now
Caught in a loop and it winds you back
But anything can change

Take a chance now
Cause it's waiting
Share the truth now
A new day will come, yeah

You will be safe
You will be free
This won't decide who you're gonna be
You will be safe
You will be new
The cycle will break
The future will change
And you will be sane

Scream it out loud
And watch all of the pieces crumble down
Oh yeah
Consign it to me now
Cause darling that's how freedom can be found

And you will be safe
You will be free
And this won't decide who you're gonna be
You will be safe
You will be new
The cycle will break
The future will change
And you will be sane
You're sane
You will be sane
You're sane
You will be sane
