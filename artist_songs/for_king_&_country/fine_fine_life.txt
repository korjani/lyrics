Love is on a side of the highway
With his thumb in the sky
Worry's flying in the fast lane
In a suit and tie

The sun is crashing in the ocean
And you just can't help yourself but wonder how we all forget

It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life
Every day I find
It's a fine fine life

I fell asleep in a casino
You should've seen her face
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
That was never made

Jesus stranded with a flat tire
And He's grinning ear to ear and whispering these words under His breath

It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life
Every day I find
It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life

Yeah I put a step in your bones
You're never alone
Cash or coal,
Heart or soul

It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life
Every day I find
It's a fine fine life

It's a fine fine life
It's a fine fine life
Every day I find
It's a fine fine life

It's a fine fine life

It's a fine fine life

It's a fine fine life

Fine fine life

It's your life
