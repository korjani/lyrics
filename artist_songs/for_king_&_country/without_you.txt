What do you do when you don't get better?
Strong arms get too, get too weak to hold her
Oh God, give me just enough strength to make it through

Sleepless, this madness is walking me out to the ledge
And stands there beside me, shivering out on the edge
And oh God all I, all I ask is a little relief, just a moment of peace

I don't want to live without you
I'm not ready to live without you
So let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
'Cause I don't want to live without you, without you

This thorn in my side, though it cuts and stings me
Has opened these eyes, I've never seen so clearly
And oh God, I thank You, 'cause You bring me to my knees
Back on my knees

I don't want to live without you
I'm not ready to live without you
So let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
Yes, let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
'Cause I don't wanna live without you, without you

I heard a voice from the other side singing,
"Hold fast, love last"
As winter turns into summertime singing,
"Hold fast, love last"
I heard a voice from the other side singing,
"Hold fast, love last"
As winter turns into summertime singing,
"Hold fast"

So let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
Yes, let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
'Cause I don't want to live without you
No, I don't wanna live without you, without you
