Cover me with shades of disbelief
Can happiness be someone else's dream?
Numbers call to spell my name
Move about as values change
Catch me if you can, but don't delay
Today, today
It's a dream away
Today, today

Governed by the title on the wall
Commit me to a life within a fool
Happiness can often bleed
Beggars lay among the sheep
Let me take the choice the sermon pleads
Today, today
It's a dream away
Today, today
A dream away

Visions in my cell begin to breed
Was everything a fact of what I read?
Excuse me while l spell my name
Boat and ship could sound the same
Catch me if you can, but don't delay
Today, today
It's a dream away
Today, today
A dream away

Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima

Today, today
It's a dream away
Today, today
A dream away
Today, today
It's a dream away
Today, today
A dream away
