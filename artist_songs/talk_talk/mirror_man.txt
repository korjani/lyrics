Out in the street today
We're parading around
We're the height of the fashion
And she laughs 'cos we look the same
And follow all of the rule

Every little bit of my time
Keeps me checking that my clothes are in line
I'll identify without wasting time

Mirror man

Inside of her room today
She's been working all hours
For the final presentation
Each day, dressed a different way
She's the star of the road

Every little bit of her time
Keeps her checking that she stays out of line
She'll wear anything you can't recognize
