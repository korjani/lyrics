Dum, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl

Another sign with no regret
More coins inside her hand
One more time to own respect
No mercenary she stands

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl

Another hand upon her hair
Time probably erased
Distaste, and so she's left
Where guilt is out of place

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
The dum-dum girl, the dum-dum girl
