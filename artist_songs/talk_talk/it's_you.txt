Say it again
Heart of stone
Red on your face
So alone
Say it again 
I'll know it's you
God only knows
Why do lies about this girl bother you? 
Time is waiting to explain,
Why refuse?
It's you

Say it again
Heart of sand
Tears on your face 
Nothing stands
God only knows 
I've noticed you
Say it again
Why do lies about this girl bother you?
Time is waiting to explain,
Why refuse?
It's you

It's you,
It's you,
It's you

Say it again
I know It's you
God only knows
Why do lies about this girl bother you?
Tired of waiting to explain.
why refuse?
It's you

It's you,
It's you,
It's you
