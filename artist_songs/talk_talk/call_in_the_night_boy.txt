Say goodnight
Every hour brings the morning of my life
Out of time
Every step I take I'm further down the line

Here I stand left behind
My eyes open wide
If you need me you should try

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy

Say goodnight
Every hour brings the morning of my life
Out of tune
Every breath I take I take it over you

I don't care what people say
I don't care night is day
I'll remember if you say

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy
Calling

Here I stand left behind
My eyes are open wide
If you need me you should try

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy
Calling
