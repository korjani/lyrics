Forgive me if I flip my face of passion
It's the only way

Condemn me if I raise my voice in anger
Such a dumb, dumb way

Why is it so hard?
Better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?

Forgive me if my favourite choice of action
Is the easy way

Condemn if out of haste, I'll claim, "It's over"
When the doubt remains

Why is it so hard?
Better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?
Why is it so hard?

Sometimes I find
It's better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?
Why is it so hard?
