Desire
Whispered, spoken
In time
Rivers, oceans

That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
I'm just content to relax than drown within myself

Of mind
Sheltered, broken
Denied
Gifted, stolen

That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself

That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself

That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
I'm just content to relax than drown within myself
