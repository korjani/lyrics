I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I, I, I, really fucking meant it
