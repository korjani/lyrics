[Andrew Taggart:]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, 'cause I don't smoke 'gars, babe
I'm at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, can't stop
Let's get high, we can't stop
No

[Andrew Taggart:]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Andrew Taggart (Wiz Khalifa):]
We ain't ever getting older
(Khalifa man)
We ain't ever getting older

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
Been smoking so long I got my own strain
Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cause you'll never do it again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, 'cause I don't smoke 'gars, babe
I'm at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
And get high, can't stop
Let's get high, we can't stop
No

[Andrew Taggart & Halsey:]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Andrew Taggart:]
So, baby, pull me closer

[Andrew Taggart & Halsey:]
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(We ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
