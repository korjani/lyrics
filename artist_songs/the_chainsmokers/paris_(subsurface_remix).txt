If we go down then we go down together
They'll say we could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out."

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, "How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
We'll show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a flower and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet

Out on the terrace
I'm [?] in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the bus we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
We'll show them we are better
