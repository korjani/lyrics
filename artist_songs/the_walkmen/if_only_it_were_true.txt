If only it was true
I'd go with you
If only it was true
I'd say, "I do"

And all the things that we do
I could face the day
And all the long night too
If only it was true

My head is all full of dreams
It's nothing new
But, baby, dreaming is all a man can do

So don't come calling for me
Cause, baby, my dream ain't through
And when, when I've had enough
Oh, then I'll die in dreams of you

So don't come calling for me
Cause, baby, my dream ain't through
And when, when I've had enough
Oh, then I'll die in dreams of you
