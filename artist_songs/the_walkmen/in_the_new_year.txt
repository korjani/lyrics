Oh, I'm still living
At the old address
And I'm waiting on the weather
That I know will pass

I know that it's true
It's gonna be a good year
Out of the darkness
And into the fire
I tell you I love you
And my heart's in the strangest place
That's how it started
And that's how it ends

Well I know you're with me
It's a point of pride
And it's louder than lightning
In this room of mine

Oh, I'm just like you
I never hear the bad news
And I never will
We won by a landslide
Our troubles are over
My sisters are married to all of my friends
Yeah, that's how it started

You took your sweet time
And I waited by without complaint
Til all the pipe dreams made me insane

So it's all over
It's all over anyhow
You took your sweet time
Finally, I opened my eyes

My friends and my family
They are asking of me:
“How long will you ramble?
"How long did you say it would be?"
Snow is still falling
I'm almost home
I'll see you in the new year
