Found out
Not just now... no
I just know it's not, your good time.
I'm wrong. Even now, I'm Wrong. Even Now
Even now, [?]
I don't care that much right now
I'm a mess. I can't get out.
That's the last thing.
I... I can see for the worst anyway.
This could be time for us.
This could be time for us.

It's been fun, let's leave it at that.
Goodnight, sure it's been a long time.
Let's not push our luck this time.
Let's not push our luck this time.

Goodnight, sure it's been a long time.
That'll be enough for tonight.
Let's not push our luck this time.

I wasted hours. I'll forgive.
The hard luck. I'll accept it.
I hope you won't think of it.
I hope you won't think of it.
