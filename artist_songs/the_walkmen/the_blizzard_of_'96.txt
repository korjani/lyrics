Windows close just like my eyelids as I'm sleeping, 
Lift the blinds up slowly, let the night in. 
We've begun to work things out again. 
There's no other way around it. 
Windows close just like your ear drum, as I'm saying, 
Lets forget those things I did this winter. 
We've begun to work things out again, 
There's no other way around it.
