Our children will always hear
Romantic tales of distant years
Our gilded age may come and go
Our crooked dreams will always glow

Stick with me
Oh you're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been

Remember remember
All we fight for
Remember remember
All we fight for

Don't leave me
Oh you're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been
Don't leave me now
You're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been

Remember remember
All we fight for
Remember remember
All we fight for
