I left you a million times
I left you a million times
The irony ain't lost on me
Oh no no no no no
Oh no no no no no

Virginia, I miss you the most
Virginia, I got so lost
Your sympathy ain't wasted on me
I left you a million times
I left you a million times
The irony ain't lost on me

Oh no no no no no
