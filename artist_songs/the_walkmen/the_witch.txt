It starts like this
The kiss is a kiss
The kiss is a kiss
Smiles are all smiles
Say your goodbyes
Cause love will decide

Your life in hand
You made your demands
You made your demands
And now what else can you do
Cause that don’t mean love
Love will decide

Your world was always mine
Your world was always mine
It’s dark, oh man
Driving through central Michigan
Listening to the country station
And wondering where I stand
Love will decide
Love will decide
