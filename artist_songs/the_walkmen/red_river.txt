The light is finally fading
And so i say goodnight
I step out in the darkness
Around the firelight
I step out in the darkness
Lost my way around
I'm going now
but I'll be by tonight
I'll get held up by this heart of mine

I was forgotten and
Buried in the ground
I was reborn into this world
Never made it out

I wandered through the morning
I strode along the lines
I woke up in the trenches
They left the dead behind
I woke up in the trenches
Burned up in the mud
And now I'm gone
It just bury me alive
If I'm held up by this heart of mine

Oh no
It's all forgotten and
Buried in the ground
I was reborn into this world
Never made it out

Red River
Carry me home
I never
Been so alone
When the lime
Messed up my eyes
Red River
Carry me home
