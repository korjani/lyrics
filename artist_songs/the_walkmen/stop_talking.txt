My hands 
Come together 
And I draw in the breath through my teeth 
Your curt shots 
Sarcastic remarks 
Come so often 
They're never sincere 

Darker amusement sets in 
That's the problem 
You're saying something and my eyes 
Open wider 
And we grin and we stare at the floor 
Your jokes missed 
Your hands grow to fists 
And your lips purse 
Expecting the worst 
With every word 
That's how it started 
That's the problem 
And after we're done 
I can still feel your eyes on my forehead 
And after we're done 
I can still feel the pain in my free time
