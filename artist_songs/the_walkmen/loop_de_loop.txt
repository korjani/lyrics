Here we go loop de loop
Here we go loop de li
Here we go loop de loop
On a Saturday night

We're having a party
Ev'rybody's havin' a great time
All the gang's here and a-dancin'
Yeah I'm loopin' with a baby of mine

Here we go loop de loop
Here we go loop de li
Here we go loop de loop
On a Saturday night

Darling are you ready
To loop a loop loop with me
Start right there
Wait just a minute until I count to three

(one, two, three)
Here we go loop de loop
Here we go loop de li
Here we go loop de loop
On a Saturday night
