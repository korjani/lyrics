Family comes from Kentucky
And there's bourbon in the blood
They left the country for the city in 1951
Me I'm in between two worlds
Saw you on TV last night

Life looks easy on the TV
We ride into some blue evening
I fill my evenings with images of hazy here after
I don't even know your name
It's your southern heart I'm after
It's your southern heart I'm after

Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
