Many nights
Dwindle by
Midnight moon's on the rise
My heavy head's going light
So I'll go home and sleep tonight

I'm walking tonight
About as far as I can go
I listen to the last song
By the windows

Here's to you and the stars above
The half moon and your pretty eyes
And here's to you and the setting sun
The bar men and their sorry songs

I'll be drunk before too long
And I'll keep up in case I can talk
This really don't say it all
There's too much to enclose
These postcards from tiny islands
Mean more than you know

So here's to you and the ground below
The grass bar and the empty sky
I'm walking tonight
About as far as I can go
The marble was stolen
The midnight moon, it glows
This really don't say it all
It's too much to enclose
Life is so easy now
Everything is working out

Oh, highways are flying by
