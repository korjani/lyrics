Well they say, “Can’t please everyone”
But I’m stuck on a winning streak
Well today, there’s clarity
And tonight, I see tomorrow 
All at once, the winter’s here
All the lochs are frozen over
As I look in back of me
See a shape beside the walkway

Half of my life, I’ve been watching
Half of my life, I’ve been waking up 
Birds in the sky could warn me
There’s no life like the slow life 

So for now, I’ll take my time
For now, I can’t be bothered
But I learned a lot of things
And I fudged a lot of numbers

Once again, the winter’s here
All the lochs are frozen over 
So I look in back of me
See a shape beside the walkway

Half of my life, I’ve been watching
Half of my life, I’ve been waking up 
Birds in the sky could warn me
There’s no life like the slow life
