Gone are the flames
Gone is the world of mystery
The slaughter that
Is gonna stay that way
One man he waits
One man's a-dancing to his grave
Who do I follow
Who do I blame

You can't deny it
The ports are old
You can't deny it
They wrote it wrong

After the fun
After all the bubble gum
There is no sweetness
Left on my tongue

You can't deny it
The ports are old
You can't deny it
They wrote it wrong

Cause love is luck
