Out of station through my radio 
nothings on 
it's like a joke thats told with out its final line 
where's it going 
where had it belonged

I know 
I'm trying 
I'm trying to wake up 
wake up 

and I tell by you way too far 
looking back I had a casing sentimental suns and shade 
would they ever spin around 
forward 
they're trying 
they're trying 
and so they do 

in the call of a new world 
as I climb to the next floor 
haven't we 
met before 
under brighter skies above 
above 

anyway its fine 
we're walking through wind 
unfamiliar scenes 
we're choking on it 
and we're shaking hands with someone we don't know now 

wake up 
wake up
