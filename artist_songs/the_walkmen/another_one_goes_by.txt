Is your skin your skeletons
Splinters my daydreams
Under surface see is it any seed
Shadows fly across the wall
I walk outside and try to see you right in front of me
Silhouette of something sweet and so bright

I don't know what to offer you, I'm only broke and lonely
And another one goes, and another one goes by
Sometimes when I step outside, I see you standing right in front of me
And another one goes, and another one goes by

Don't know what to offer you, I'm only broke and lonely
And another one goes, and another one goes by
Sometimes when I walk outside, I see it right in front of me, it's so bright
And another one goes, and another one goes, and another one goes by
