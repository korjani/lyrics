Reaching for a butterfly
Old soldiers never die
And the gun against their shoulder
Well, it gets a little older
And just like that old shoulder
It just gets put away
Well, I'm an old, forgotten soldier
Since they put an end to war
And I like to tell my story
But you don't wanna hear about the war

I'm an old, forgotten campaign hero
Left without a cause
Because, they took away my wars
I'm an old, forgotten railroad
A broken, lonely ammo-train
And my rusty ammunition
Has been left out in the rain

I'm an old, forgotten part-time doughboy
I tried to save the world
The world was round
We fired around
Heard all around the world

I'm an old, forgotten campaign hero
Left without a cause
Because, they took away my wars
I'm an old, forgotten railroad
A broken, lonely ammo-train
And my rusty ammunition
Has been left out in the rain
