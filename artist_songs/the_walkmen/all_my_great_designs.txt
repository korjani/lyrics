Well I've been hearing things,
Voices carry over water.
Things I can't deny,
Night after night, 
Night after night after night.

My broken heart.

You will know when you've been running around.
You will know when you've been out on your own.
It will haunt you night after night.
Haunt you night after night.

Well I've been seeing things,
Lights are shining through my eyelids.
All the great designs,
Never make it out of my sleep.

You will know when you've been running around.
You will know when you've been out on your own.
It will haunt you night after night.
You can't hide what you know night after night.
