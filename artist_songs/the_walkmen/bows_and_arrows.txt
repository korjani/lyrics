Come on, come on, let's have a song
The morning sun is soon to come
We don't have time to linger on

There comes a time, there comes a time
To make it right when I was wrong
And someday, girl, we'll get along

Goodbye to all your plans
You can listen to me now
Your head is bent out of shape
But your feet are on the ground
But, more and more, the ceiling's coming down

I take my time to face the day
It's good to hear you talk this way
So we'll keep this up as friends this time
Nothing's wrong
I'll stand up as I shake your hand
We'll be alright

And I'll do it all again
That man here is a fraud
But nobody gives a damn
And, more and more, we'll all be weighing in

And I'll sleep on your floor tonight
Give me some time to set this right
Where's your head?
There's nothing for you here
Nothing's wrong
Take a look around, you'll see it clear

Come on, come on, let's get things done
The morning sun has come and gone
Get up, get out, and move along

There comes a time, there comes a time
To make it right, when I was wrong
And someday, girl, we'll get along
And someday, girl, we'll get along
