You don't love me, just the kissing
Don't trust the facts, trust the fiction
I'll take the fiction
I'll take the fiction

What it is and what it should be
Baby I want everything
What it is and what it should be

Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
Not me
Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love

I want to stay up all night again
I want to work hard
Don't want to play again
Don't want to

Where we are and where we should be
Baby I want everything
Where we are and where we should be

Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
Not me
Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
