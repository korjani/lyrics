I hear that you got yourself a house
and all your friends you finally figured out
but you go out in the night til you got no place to go
I see you on the corner where you're trying to use the phone
and everyone will say you missed your chance
and everyone will say you've lost you're edge
but it's just something that you've heard about a thousand time before
and every time you're falling then you'll see me on the floor
and someday when you turn around
you'll take a wife, and start a life
it won't be long

I hear that you got yourself a job
and all your friends you finally nailed down
but you go out in the night till you got no place to go
something you ain't doing right is haunting you at home
now we've been hanging round for quite a while
so let's get out of here and take a drive
on the parkway tonight
you can hear the engines roar
the flashing lights will nab you when you're driving your way home
and someday when you turn around you'll see the door is closing
