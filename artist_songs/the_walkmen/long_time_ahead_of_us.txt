Oh, bad luck, bad luck
You've come for me
And the day's only getting shorter
When you come, come along in the evening
Then leave me in the middle of the night

Take me tonight as I am
Leave me the way I was found

Oh, moonlight
Oh, moonlight
Help me sleep
There's far too much weight on my mind
The stars in the night sky
They worry me
Oh, shadows to my left, to my right

Oh, and tomorrow we'll rise
And the sky will be bright

Long time
Ahead of us
Good luck 'round every turn
Now that I got you
