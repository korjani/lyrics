Louisiana
Come go away with me
We'll take the highway
I'll see you in between

I listen to my head
And every word have come
It's been two days without it
The sleeping in the sun, hey

Crossing through Tennessee
Watching the sunrise
Thinking about a dream
Well, we'll listen all night

To the footsteps in the hall
There's thunder and there's lightening
A hundred miles off

I got my hands full all summer long
I got my hands full
I got my hands full

Louisiana
Come go away with me
Drinking our coffee
Under the canopy

Never saw a morning
I slept through half a day
There's thunder and there's lightening
A hundred miles away, oh

I got my hands full, oh summertime
I got my hands full
I got my hands

Da da da da da
Da da da da da
