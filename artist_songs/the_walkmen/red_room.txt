The red moon is rising behind you
The ocean is pounding away
I held up a light to the smoke but
The redness blows it away

And the night is cold
And the clouds go by
Tomorrow morning
I hope to be home
By your side

The riptide is pulling me under
I'm drifting, drifting away
Tomorrow the sun will be brighter
The water will rise and wash us away

But the stars are cold
And the air is bright
And I see you now
You shine like the steel on my knife
The darkness is wrapped all around me tonight

I miss you
I miss you there's no one else
I do
I do
