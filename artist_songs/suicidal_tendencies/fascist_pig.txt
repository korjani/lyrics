Tense atmosphere in the air
Riot written everywhere
Riot squads coming from over there
Time to go home if you're square

Riot squad, bash their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I want to be a fascist pig
Love to fight, what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I want to be a fascist pig

Throw a bottle in the air
Put them up to their dare
We'll just laugh while they stare
Let them hit us, see if we care!

Get attacked by them
You'll never heal
They'll rob your conscience
Your sanity they'll steal
They'll beat your brains until they spill
That's the fascist favorite meal!
