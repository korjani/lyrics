[Rocky George/Mike Muir]

Survive
You can not stand a single word I say
But you manage to hear every word anyway
Your eyes they always seem to be fixed on me
But not for love but for money

[CHORUS]
You say nothing yet I still hear
I am the thing that you most fear
I cause the pain deep in your heart
O, how I love to tear your world apart
Well I feel your pain and I survive
And I survive

I see your anger, I can hardly wait
How it feels so good to cause you such hate
Tried to ignore me. Thought I'd go away
But I'm back for good. I'm here to stay

[CHORUS]

You thought that you could get the best of me
To put me down, it seemed, so easily
I take such pride in the work I do
You hoped I'd fail but I'm not like you

[CHORUS]

I feel your pain so I survive
