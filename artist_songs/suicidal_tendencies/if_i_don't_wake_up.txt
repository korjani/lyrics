Why do I wake up in  the morning-nothing's changed since the day of my birth
Why do I wake up in the morning-I make no difference on  this earth

Strength has left-has to be-something has died inside of me

If I don't wake up in the morning-at my funeral would anyone care
If I don't wake up in the morning-would anyone even be there

You can put me down-you can put me out, you can try to ignore
But now you're gonna hear me when I shout WAKE UP

Why should I wake up in the morning-it be just another wasted day
Why should I wake up in the morning-don't do nothing right anyway

That was then-not anymore-now I go blasting out the door

I'm gonna wake up in the morning-I'll prove you wrong I will not fail
I'm gonna wake up in the morning-I'm gonna blaze a brand new trail

Might not be smart, but if I'm strong
I know for sure no one ever will prove me wrong
