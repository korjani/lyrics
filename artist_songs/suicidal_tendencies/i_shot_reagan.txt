I shot Reagan I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shoot you dead in heaven you'll rot
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an Angels voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice

Rot in heaven, you're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven, cause you're forgiven in hell

I shot Lennon, I shot the Pope
I shot the devil now you ain't got no hope
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an Angels voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice
