I wish so hard that I could be just like the
...one you want me to
But it doesn't seem to work though I'm trying.
I try so hard to do what's right, to be so good,
...to make you proud, but it never seems to satisfy you.
It's just the person that you want,...it's not the person that
I am.
The conflict inside's horrifying.
I want so much for you to think of me as a person
...that deserves your respect & attention.
I wonder if I'll ever do the things you want...(the way you want)
When I don't even know what I want yet.
It's not that I'm rebelling against the person you are
It's just that I don't know who I am.
All I know is it hurts, oh how it hurts
Oh God, do you know how I'm hurting?
There's an emotion in me.  There's an emotion in me
Emotion No. 13

Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not lying.
Emotion No. 13 easy cryin'
Don't ask me how I know, but I'm dying

Emotion No. 13 blows my mind away
Emotion No. 13, it blows me away

Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not...
Emotion No. 13, says I'm...
Don't ask me how I know, but I think I'm...
Don't ask me how I know, but I think I'm dying,...dying, dy-ing, dying

All I know is it hurts, oh how it hurts
Oh God do you know how I'm hurting?
There's an emotion in me, there's an emotion in me
Emotion No. 13

Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not lying
Emotion No. 13, feels like I'm dying
