[Louiche/Mike Muir]

I got a story to tell, now listen up real well
Pay attention this way to what I got to say
Took it to the street, rap to the people we meet
Now we're rocking out hard to the Suicidal beat
Tried to deny our right, so we're putting up a fight
Just doing our thang, they tried to call it a gang
Saw the way we look, that's all that it took
That's all she wrote, they had their scapegoat

Dressed down, homeboyz, minority-join the Army

We're the few, we're the proud, we like to jam it loud
The music we play won't have it any other way
We're armed to the bone with our music and our tone
Recruiting on the street fwith the sound of our beat
Growing larger every day and every time we play
Don't need no college plan, we're just a hard-rocking band
We like our music to please but we ain't gonna appease
No pressure's too much to make us change our touch

Hardcore, metal, the new wave
We're not a gang-join the Army

Don't be no fool, don't let your prejudice rule
Don't judge y your fear, judge us by your ear
Can't believe every word of every story that you've heard
Just play the song, I know you'll start to rock along
Well I don't care 'bout the clothes you wear
It's the size of your heart, not the length of your hair
Don't make no difference to me, the color that you be
Black, white or brown, it's all the same to me

Well if you still don't believe you best get up and leave
Do what you must do, but this ain't the place for you
You got no right but if you start a fight
We'll be rockin' your head but with our fists instead
I'll fight it with the band, right down till the end
Ask anyone I've met, this ain't no idle threat
Don't flap no fit and it won't come to this
Bust as for me, I'm down with the Army

New York, London, Venice
Why join a gang?
Join the Army

Suicidal rock-join the Army
Suicidal rock-join the Army
Suicidal rock-join the Army
Suicidal rock-join the Army
Suicidal rock-I want you to join the Army-S.T.
