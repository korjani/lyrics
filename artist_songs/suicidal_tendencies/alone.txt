I scream at the sky, it's easier than crying
I'm shyish when I'm shouting out loud
I feel so alone in a room full of people
I'm loudist when I'm in a crowd
I'm alone, and nobody hears me
Can't nobody heal me, won't somebody help me
I'm alone, I just need
Someone to take my hand and pick me up when I'm feeling down
Someone to take my heart and give it a home
Someone to be with me and help me through the times when I'm
down and lonely
Someone to be with me when I'm alone
I'm alone, all alone
Alone is the way I live, it's not the way I want it but you
know
You can't give in, alone is the way I feel, it's so hard to
understand
Why I've got to be alone

If you look in my heart you'd see it
I'm trying to be something better
If you look in my heart you'd feel it
I've got to keep moving on
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm just trying to make my world better
If you look in my heart you'd see it
I got to do it alone

I've been down, I've been down
I've been down, down, down so low
I've been lost, so lost with no place left to go
I've had emotions, emotions that you better hope you never
know
Sometimes it feels like I just can't take no more

If you look in my heart you'd see it
I'm trying to be something better
If you look in my heart you'd feel it
I've got to keep moving on
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm just trying to make my world better
If you look in my heart you'd see it
I got to do it alone

Seems like things just keep getting further out of hand
Why can't for once things just go as I plan
How dare you, how dare you tell me that you understand
Let me tell you straight out, there ain't nobody here that can
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone

If you look in my heart you'll see it
If you look in my heart you'd feel it
If you look in my heart you'd know it
I'm not trying to make no one bitter
I'm just alone, leave me alone, alone alone, now leave me

I've lived in places that you wouldn't never ever want to be
Places where for a minute you couldn't ever stand to be
I've seen things, I've seen things you'd never want to see
SO what gives, what gives you the right to be the judge of me
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone

A room full of people, can't nobody help me, I'm alone
I just need someone to take my hand and pick me up when I'm
Feeling down, when I'm down
Someone to take my heart and give it a home, when I'm down
Someone to be with me and help me through the times
I'm down and lonely, when I'm down
Someone to be with me when I'm alone
I'm alone, all alone
Alone is the way I live, it's not the way I want it but I
Know I can't give in
Alone is the way I feel, there ain't nothing quite as sad as
A person that's alone
