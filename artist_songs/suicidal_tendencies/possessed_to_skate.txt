[Louiche/Mike Muir]

Let's skate!

Seemed like such an innocent toy
He was the All-American boy
Got a skate at eight years old
Now the story can be told

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Skating takes him up in height
He's a pilot on a modern flight
See him flying through the air
If he don't land then he don't care

[CHORUS]
Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
Cause he never hesitates
He's the wizard on the wheels
Like a modern gladiator ain't got no fears
So skate

He shoots the pool like a launching pad
If it ain't insane then you can't get rad
Skating is all that's on his mind
He's skating radical all the time

[CHORUS]

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Looks like a magic carpet ride
Six foot airiels inverts backside
Optical illusion it must be
He redefines insanity

[CHORUS]

Doesn't understand why you'd wanna walk
Ain't got time to sit and talk
Used to be just like you and me
Now he's an outcast of society

Beware he's possessed to skate!

And the skating's getting radical
