[Louiche/Mike Muir]

I see destruction as it rages through your veins
I see depression as it fills your heart with pain
I see the cure you found, your artificial peace
I see your body rot, your solution now has it's feast

And now I look, I look in your eyes
Looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes

What I see in your eyes
I can see, they tell no lies
Looking in your eyes

I see salvation oh so close, but yet so far
I see the gilmmering of the holy star
I see your future, it's a nightmare and I lie
But you refused my help, now I have no more strength to try

Now I see, I see the lies
Looking in your eyes
In your eyes I see the lies

What I see in your eyes
I can see, you tell no lies
Looking in your eyes

Looking through my eyes

Well I would die for you
I've died enough now I'm through
But one day you will see
What won't but what should B-T-F. Please stay.
