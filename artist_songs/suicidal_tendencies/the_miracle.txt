I sailed forever, I sailed so far, and now I know
just what the consequences are
I laughed out loud, while I cried inside
But I didn't have the strength to say enough of this ride
Like a fool-I believed in a miracle
I wanted to forget, of what I'm not sure
But I found an answer-it seemed to be a perfect cure

Controlled my actions, controlled my thoughts
Controlled my feelings, and now I feel my body rot-like a fool

I believed in the miracle

Twisting and I'm turning-freezing then I'm burning
Laughing then I'm crying-am I living or am I dying
Swearing then I'm praying-don't even know what I'm saying
Happy then so sad-forgiving then so mad

Do you still, do you still believe, do you still believe in,
Do you still believe in miracles?

Pushing then pulling-who am I fooling
A friend  then a foe-do I really even know?
Love and then hate
Peace then at war-but what am I fighting for
And you always try to
Keep me-oh so sleepy
So I can't realize-that it's all lies
And the more it takes hold of me-the less chance that I'll ever be free
And even though I don't believe-it's so hard to leave-a miracle-a miracle

Waiting-always hesitating-for that perfect day-that day was yesterday
And the more you're gonna wait-the more of a chance that it will be too late

How can you afford to wait, you just can't afford to wait
I shed a tear I won't deny it, but just one tear I already cried it
And now you'll see me cry no more, don't even know what I was crying for
