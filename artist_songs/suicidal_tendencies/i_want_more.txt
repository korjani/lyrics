Don't wanna pump nobody's gas I want more
Don't wanna kiss my bosses ass I want more
Don't wanna take the first job I find I want more
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine I want more

Slaving in a factory a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, gave myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

Don't wanna work at the golden arches I want more
Don't wanna wash rich mans cars I want more
Don't wanna be nobody's gardener I want more
Don't wanna be a garbage man I want more
