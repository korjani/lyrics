You say I'm always getting mad
I'm always such a drag
But I'm not like that
And I know that I'm too hard to find
That I don't make time
And I'm just like that

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
It'll just make you mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

And I know that I still hang around
And I bring you down
And I'm just like that
You say that I'm too hard to find
And I don't make time
And I'm just like that

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
It'll just make you mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

I know it's hard
I know it's hard being around me
I know it's hard
I know it's hard being around me

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
It'll just make you mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
It'll just make you mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound
