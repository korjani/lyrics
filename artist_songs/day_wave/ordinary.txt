You feel like you're tumbling down
You feel like you're turned around
If this is all you have
If this is all you have

Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more
Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more

I wanted to be around
I want to be something else
But this is all I have
But this is all I have

Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more
Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more

You're ordinary also
You want more
You're ordinary also
You want more

Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more
Do you feel like me too?
You're ordinary also
You want more
(You're ordinary also)
(You want more)
