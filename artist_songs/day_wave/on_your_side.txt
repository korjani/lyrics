Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh

They're all just the same when I look from far away
And you ask me to stay but I'd rather let this fade

But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
I am on your side

And my mind's already made cause I'm different anyway
And you ask me to stay but I'd rather let this fade

But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
I am on your side

Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh

But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
(Oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I am on your side
(Oh-oh-oh-oooh)

Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
