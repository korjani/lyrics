Hold on tight
I won't go alone
Home tonight
I won't go alone

'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore

That's okay
You're just the same
That's okay
You're just the same

You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind

Don't let go
I don't wanna be alone
I won't let it show
I don't wanna be alone

'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore

That's okay
You're just the same
That's okay
You're just the same

You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind

Hold on tight
I won't go alone
Home tonight
I won't go alone

'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
'Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore

You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind

Bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
Bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
