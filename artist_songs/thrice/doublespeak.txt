I drug my heart with doublespeak,
All my misgivings disappear.
It helps to keep my conscience clean.
(The ends will justify the means,)
But still I’m always careful what I hear.

I don’t wanna know who really pulls the strings,
Just as long as it’s not you or me.

There’s a jackboot toe tap keeping time, 
while the children dance and play.
Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime, 
you just look the other way.

I slowly carve my soul away.
Piece by piece I sacrifice.
To comfort and peace of mind
(I keep my toes on the party line.)
There’s nothing wrong dear, don’t think twice.

I don’t wanna know who really pulls the strings,
Just as long as it’s not you or me.

There’s a jackboot toe tap keeping time, 
while the children dance and play.
Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime, 
won't you look the other way.

Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime, 
won't you look the other, look the other way.
