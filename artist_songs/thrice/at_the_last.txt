It’s a shame that some must go without,
But I was no fool to think it might be my problem.
Needy hands were reaching out;
I kept my spare change and my pride in a tight fist.

And now at the last, everything is changed in this pale light
That death has cast on all I’ve done - on all I've done.

I’m a good man on the whole;
Who could blame me for looking out for number one?
I never killed, I never stole;
A small indulgence now and then, so what of it?

I’m a good man.
I’m a good man.
Am I a good man?
I thought I was,
But the rewards of this life now count for naught.
My body: soon buried and left to rot.
The time’s gone, how quickly it all has passed.
My God, now I see how I’ve squandered each and every breath.

Now at the last, everything is changed in this pale light;
That death has cast on all I’ve done.

Now at the last, everything is changed in this pale light;
And looking back I am undone - I am undone.
