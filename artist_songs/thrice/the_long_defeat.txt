The tyranny of deterioration
It worries me that it's all just a waste of time
Taking one step forward, two steps back
Still I believe there's a thread through the thorns
And I believe that somewhere it's warm
And I believe that it's ever bright beyond this black

So keep holding on to hope without assurance
Holding on to a memory of light
But will the morning come? For all I know
We’ll never see the sun, but together we’ll fight the long defeat

The suffering that I see all around
It's enough to keep me crashing down till I
I lie wrecked and reeling from these falls
Still I believe there's a word in the wire
And I believe there's a way through the fire
And I believe there's a joy that blooms beyond these walls

So keep holding on to hope without assurance
Holding on to a memory of light
But will the morning come? For all I know
We’ll never see the sun, but together we’ll fight the long defeat
