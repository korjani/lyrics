One day the dreamers died within us 
When all our answers never came 
We hid the truth beneath our skin but 
Our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget 
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead 

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding 
We held our hearts over the flame 
We couldn't help but call it treason 
After that we couldn't fill our frames 
After that our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget 
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead 

In summers past we'd challenge fate 
With higher pitch and perfect aim 
And standing fast, we'd radiate 
A light we loved but never named 
But the answers never came 
And our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left (we are the ones who lost our faith)
Of everything we swore we never would forget (can we be saved?)
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead (we are the ones who lost our faith)
A ghost of everything we thought but never said (can we be saved?)
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 

We are the ones who lost our faith 
We dug ourselves an early grave 
We are the dead, can we be saved?
