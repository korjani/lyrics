You told me not to worry
It's all for the greater good
Who made you judge and jury
Who gave you the axe and hood

You wanted it sealed
I'll tell the real story

I'm the bird that sings
I'm the whistleblower
Wake up and take warning
Congressmen and kings
I'm the whistleblower
Waiting in the wings

You told me keep it quiet
That I'd ruin everything
But I'd rather start a riot
Than help you pull these strings

You told me to kneel
But I'll tell the real story

I'm the bird that sings
I'm the whistleblower
Wake up and take warning
Congressmen and kings
I'm the whistleblower
Waiting in the wings

Watching, waiting in the wings

Yeah I'll tell the real story

I'm the bird that sings
I'm the whistleblower
Wake up and take warning
Congressmen and kings
I'm the whistleblower
Waiting in the wings

Watching, waiting in the wings
Watching, waiting in the wings
