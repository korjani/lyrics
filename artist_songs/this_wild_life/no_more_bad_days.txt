I thought we hit rock bottom
And then the floor gave out
The year you lost your health
The year we lost our house
I think the world has a way
Of choosing the worst day
To knock us down
And drag us out
But every door that's closed
Opens a new window

No more bad days
It's clear from here
No more bad days
For you my dear

Because my legs are strong
My arms are stretched so long
I will always reach for you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do
You may have given up
But I will lift you up
I will always carry you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do

I thought we hit rock bottom
And then the floor gave out
Yeah it was hard back then
It's even harder now
Cause when you're young and poor
You hope for so much more
I hope for rain to wash us clean
And make a brand new start
For both our tired hearts

Ohh, oh, oh
No more bad days
It's clear from here
No more bad days
For you my dear

Because my legs are strong
My arms are stretched so long
I will always reach for you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do
You may have given up
But I will lift you up
I will always carry you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do

Resilience is my promise
I'll never give up on us
Just lift your head up higher
I'll be here when you're tired
And need some peace
Just get some sleep

Because my legs are strong
My arms are stretched so long
I will always reach for you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do
You may have given up
But I will lift you up
I will always carry you
Cause you are sweet and pure
Yeah you are beautiful
In everything you do
