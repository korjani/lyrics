I swear I see the seasons change
More often than I see your face
November came and went
The Summer left without a trace
And I'm left with distance on my mind
Was it me that caused you to just pack up and leave?
When you did you took everything
I still hate seeing you without me

I'm better with you, you're better with me
I still miss all our nights
Even fights were all better with you
You're better with me
There is nobody else who can love me the way that you do
Better than you
I still miss all our days and the way you would carry me through
I'll carry you too
There is nobody else who could love you the way that I do

Who can love you the way that I do?

You filled my place with his embrace
His touch was cold, you never came
You filled a hole that's in my soul
I wish you felt the same
But is it too late for things to change?
It was you, because leaving is just what you do
When you finally got something to lose
I just don't feel the same without you

I'm better with you, you're better with me
I still miss all our nights
Even fights were all better with you
You're better with me
There is nobody else who can love me the way that you do
Better than you
I still miss all our days and the way you would carry me through
I'll carry you too
There is nobody else who could love you the way that I do

If there's a way for us to learn to forgive
There's nothing that I, that I wouldn't give
There's still a space that I have buried away
It's deep in my heart, it's always your place 

I'm better with you, you're better with me
I still miss all our nights
Even fights were all better with you
You're better with me
There is nobody else who can love me the way that you do
Better than you
I still miss all our days and the way you would carry me through
I'll carry you too
There is nobody else who could love you the way that I do

Who can love you the way that I do?
