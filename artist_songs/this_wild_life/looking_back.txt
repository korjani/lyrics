I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now

Woah, woah it seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah, woah it's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked

I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You're scared to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now

Woah, woah it seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah, woah it's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked

Uh uh, uh uh
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that

I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And oh, I gave my very best, with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back

Woah, woah it seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah, woah it's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
