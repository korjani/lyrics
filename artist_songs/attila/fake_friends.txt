Yeah I've had this on my mind for ages now
You're just to blind to see the obvious truth
Your life is plagued with tons of fake friends
and there's a reason for it too

Never shut your mouth you just go on and on and spew your shit.
You live a life of lies you hypocrite
Mark my words I'll never bow down and be your friend you worthless bitch
You're just another spineless piece of shit

Never shut your mouth you just go on and on and spew your shit
You live a life of lies you hypocrite
Mark my words I'll never bow down and be your friend you worthless bitch

Fake friends is all you'll find
When you treat everyone like shit and leave your morals behind
Fake friends is all you'll find

And all your friends are assholes too, putting up a fucking front
Don't bite off what you can't chew
