Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck do you think you are?!
You betrayed me this whole fucking time
I'm the baddest motherfucker in the building
So remember when it's time for me to get my revenge
I will find your fucking bitch
And fuck her, right in front of you

Some people think that they can get away with murder
But everybody here can see the blood right on their hands
It's a crazy fucking world and there's no one left to trust
As people we have voices, leave the traitors in the dust
Revenge is something lethal and the taste is bittersweet
Their punishment awaits, we'll sweep their bitches off their feet!

It's ironic when she screams my name and begs for more
It's really sick, I'll hand it to you shes a
CRAZY BITCH
I like the way she rides this dick

I didn't think I'd have to warn you
You let it go too far again
I thought you knew that I was crazy!
I let my actions speak loud

Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it-
I can tell she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the though of it
Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it-
I can tell she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the thought of it

So let me speak, answer me-
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU

You walk around with your nose up in the air
But you can't smell the shit that comes out of your mouth
You're a liar, you're a bitch, and you're a fake
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE

I've spent my precious time dealing with your problems
And payback is a bitch
What goes around comes around my friend
And you will soon realize it!

PAYBACK IS A BITCH!
