This is a world-class event
Glad you could make an appearance
Its been a crazy past couple of years
So take a seat, grab a drink or two and open your ears
Money can’t help you now
Buying your way through life
It may have worked in the past, but how the FUCK are you gonna buy yourself outta this one?

Lights out motherfucker OH
LIGHTS OUT
There were bitches that came and went, sometimes I tend to forget
But hey, that’s what your good friends are for

There are times when I can’t open my own eyes
Blinded by intoxication, its killin me
Feed me lies and theres a chance I’ll remember
Chances are I won’t remember a thing that you said

If we could break away from our own delusions
If we could, break away, break away

Now everything begins to flash before your eyes
Your like a criminal that caught between dishonor and lies
And for a second I will question my sanity
And it might appear to me that the criminal is me
And, each living second could be your last

Now that my secret’s out-
I have finally gone insane, all my evil schemes and master plans are playing out
And you fell for the trap
While I was laughing in the back of my head
I am crazy- But so are you
