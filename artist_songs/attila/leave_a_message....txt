[Phone beeps]

[Phone ringing]

"Yo, it's Fronz I'm busy as fuck, leave a message or somethin."

"Fronz it's Mike, you need to answer the phone 
You've been ignoring my phone calls ever since you sent me these tracks 
You said you were gunna mellow out on this record 
And all you're doing is getting more offensive 
I cant fucking believe it dude
I'm gunna lose my distributors and backing 
All you care about is ruining peoples lives and fucking partying 
Thats all you ever talk about 
CALL ME NOW!"
