Take this shot with me, and let our worlds collide,
We'll drink away all the pain that's inside.
Running wild, let our minds roam free,
I've ruined lives, so you can't FUCK WITH ME!
Now can you see it clear?
Never again, I'm going back there, baby, never again, I'm going back there!
YOU GET THE PICTURE NOW!
Never again, I'm going back in time baby, never regretting all of the present times, BABY!
So what's left to say but WE KNOW WE'LL OWN THIS WORLD!
Nothing left to say that hasn't been said,
WE KNOW WE'LL OWN THIS WORLD!

Say it to my face!
I'm alive and it doesn't hurt, another lie in the crosshairs of my fate,
Don't wait too long, don't wait too long, or your conscience will consume you!
FUCK YEAH, say it again! You let your conscience consume you!

HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
Shut up, you never fucking listen!
OH!

I'm at a loss of words and overly confused with this accusation bullshit all over that you've presented to me, never gonna make an excuse that couldn't hold up for itself in court, I'm here smiling...

And you'll be just another bitch I have to deal with all the time.
Tryin' to cramp my fucking style like I really care,
I wish you'd shut your fucking mouth! WHORE!
Don't say my fucking name!
SUCK MY DICK! WHORE!

Nothing left to say
So what's left to say but WE KNOW WE'LL OWN THIS WORLD!
Nothing left to say that hasn't been said,
WE KNOW WE'LL OWN THIS WORLD!
