I KNOW YOU KNOW MY WEAKNESS!
When I think I'm flawless- you swing down low
Yesterday I stood back, and looked upon me
But I was not myself
I am nothing/do nothing= same as you inside I cry,
how I hate your self-perception
But I'll say under...
MY BREATH UNDER MY BY BREATH
Take two steps back
Form an exit
Out of my life
No second tries
THIS TIME I WON'T HOLD BACK!
And when I swing the knife towards your throat
You'll feel the pain
You'll feel the pain
FLOW! And you will never know
