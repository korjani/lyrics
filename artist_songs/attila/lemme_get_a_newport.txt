I'm losing patience with the world
and i know i know, the way to the top
never stop, never stop till our work here is done
oh how many, how many times does it take
until you, until you
can take all of these words and make one complete thought
what the fuck have i done?
i failed, you failed, we're all a failure
so add your names to the list
and call me when you figured it out!

taking over the world
fucking block-by-block
taking over the world
fucking block-by-block
someone shut this place down
they can't handle my flow, it goes a little like
this is just a play-on-words
a figment that your mind created just to fuck with your head!
so fucking leave it all behind

enter the mindset, dont think
you think too much, and its pissing me off
sit back and grab a fucking seat, my friend
your journey's about to begin!

take one for the dirty south
take two for every continent
and when they ask your name
never tell them!

i'll fight when they come here
i'll fight, with two beers in my hands
fuck

taking over the world
fucking block-by-block
taking over the world
fucking block-by-block
someone shut this place down
they can't handle my flow, someone end this song
