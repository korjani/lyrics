FUCK. THIS.
My mind is sick and I can't
THINK. STRAIGHT.
Break my addiction
OH
I'm being dragged to the depths of hell
Feels like there's no tomorrow any second might be my last
I never thought this could happen to me
I guess I'm not invincible, no one is invincible
FUCK
When will it end when will it end
it feels like time is standing still I don't know where to begin
I WANT OUT
my mind is painting me a picture of a dark and hopeless future but I know it's not real
It was my vice
I didn't know at the time but it took over mind and put my whole life in rewind and every time I tried couldn't escape my mind I just went back in line couldn't keep from falling behind
FUCK. THIS.
My mind is sick and I can't
THINK. STRAIGHT.
Break my addiction

Falling, falling, faster than I could come back
I'VE GOT TO BREAK FREE

FUCK
When will it end when will it end
it feels like time is standing still I don't know where to begin
I WANT OUT
my mind is painting me a picture of a dark and hopeless future but I know it's not real

Hey, everybody listen to me, no matter what you're dealing with I promise that you'll be free

GO
Lets set the story straight
Nothing is as perfect as you think it is and every single person has their problems that they're dealing with Everyone you idolize is fake behind those shining eyes and everyone has battles if you know it or not The world will never be perfect we'll have addiction
depression, we've got to live and learn from our mistakes and that's our whole lesson - OH!
It was my vice
I didn't know at the time but it took over mind and put my whole life in rewind and every time I tried couldn't escape my mind I just went back in line couldn't keep from falling behind
