Yeah!
Welcome to the party, let's make a toast to booze, blunts, bitches, and new beginnings,
It's a whole new chapter, let's go balls to the wall,
'Cause when you're outlawed nothing even matters at all!

No mercy for you now that we are outlawed!
No mercy for you now that we are outlawed!
No mercy for you now that we are outlawed!
No mercy for you now!
OUTLAWED!

OUTLAWED!
