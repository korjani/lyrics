I'm a bad motherfucker not a fucking role model
Fuck church, hit a bong, then go smash a fucking bottle
Got a few sluts to help me roll a few blunts
And they never question me cause they know I hate cunts
OH
Eat my words and swallow my sentences
Here we go you fucking asshole
Living off the dirt on my shoes does it keep you alive

I'm about that life

Hold me accountable
You're itching for the money that I use to wipe my ass
Here's some shitty Benjamin's
Too bad they'll never help you buy some fucking class

Trapped in a world where money controls you
Hustle hard or be a piece of shit
Watching the tears rolling down your face
I'm throwing away diamonds

I like a bad bitch
She fucks me all night
Then she counts my money while I'm on my play station
Every moments always filled with sensation
Always fucking blazing America's my nation
I wouldn't have it any other fucking way
I'm about this fucking life I hustle hard and then I play
Put your lips on my dick so you can taste success
That's the shit swallow and don't spit

I'm about that life

Trapped in a world where money controls you
Hustle hard or be a piece of shit
Watching the tears rolling down your face
I'm throwing away diamonds
On and on it never stops till the moneys gone
Rip this bong and get yo money bitch start stacking the paper

I had diamonds but I threw them away cause I don't give a fuck
SUCK MY FUCK
She rides my dick like it's a merry go round
And I just bust my nut on her

Let me tell you something
Tighter than a virgin
Making money like a surgeon
And we stack it to the roof
Because my pockets started hurting
Balling and hauling and taking over like I'm Stalin
Got a few fucks but I do not give them to anyone.
Holy shit
I guess I'm really just about that life
SUCK MY FUCK
