Lift your head 
Baby don't be scared 
Of the things that could 
Go wrong along your way 
You'll get by with a smile 
You can't win at everythin 
But you can try 
Baby you don't have to worry 
Coz there ain't no need to hurry 
No one every said there'll be 
An easy way 
When they're closin 
All their doors 
And they don't want you anymore 
It sounds funny but i'll say 
It anyway 
Girl i'll stay 
Through the bad times 
Even if i have 
To fetch you everyday 
You'll get by if you smile 
You can never be 
Too happy in this life 

[refrain:]
In a world where everybody hates 
A happy endin story 
It's a wonder love 
Can make the world go round 
But don't let them 
Bring you down 
And turn your face into a frown 
You'll get along 
With a little prayer 
And a song 

Let me hear you sing it 
Repeat refrain 
Lift your head 
Baby don't be scared 
Of the things that 
Could go wrong 
Along your way 
You'll get by with a smile 
Now it's time to kiss away 
Those tears goodbye 
Let me hear you sing it 
If you smile
