Like a target drawn across my chest
She's a bullet in Russian Roulette
You said you'd never turn your back on me
(Rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me or bury me?
(Bury me)
Why don't we end this lie,
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find, my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces

Every time you try to leave me blind
You'll never close my eyes
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

And when she spins the bottle round and round
Every time it leaves me gagged and bound
You said you'd never turn your back on me
(Rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me or bury me?
(Bury me)
Why don't we end this lie
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find, my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces

End this lie, I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find, my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces
Every time you try to leave me blind
You'll never close my eyes
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

Misery won't get the best of me
Cause now I'm calling, yes I'm calling on your bluff

Misery won't get the best of me
Cause now I'm calling, yes I'm calling on your bluff

Throw down the cards, I've had enough

Why don't we end this lie
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find, my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces
Every time you try to leave me blind
You'll never close my eyes
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

End this lie, I cant pretend this time
I need a friend to find, my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces

Every time you try to leave me blind
You'll never close my eyes
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die
