Our first stop is in Bogota 
To check Colombian fields 
The natives smile and pass along 
A sample of their yield 
Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams 
Golden Acapulco nights 
Then Morocco, and the East 
Fly by morning light 

We're on the train to Bangkok 
Aboard the Thailand Express 
We'll hit the stops along the way 
We only stop for the best 

Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon 
We burn the midnight oil 
The fragrance of Afghanistan 
Rewards a long day's toil 
Pulling into Katmandu 
Smoke rings fill the air 
Perfumed by a Nepal night 
The Express gets you there 

We're on the train to Bangkok 
Aboard the Thailand Express 
We'll hit the stops along the way 
We only stop for the best
