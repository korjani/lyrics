Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hands
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

Well the bloodsucker society, is looking for recruits
I took a sip of their sobriety, it doesn't taste that good

Well at first you're fine with working overtime
10 years go by til you're caught up in the grind
And can't escape the fact your youth is fading fast
These times won't last and once they're gone they don't come back

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hands
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

They try to fill you with anxiety, until you bite the hook
They drop a line of notoriety, they got a big chequebook

Oh they'll turn you blind for a nickel and a dime
Don't waste your time with their simple frame of mind
You can't escape the fact your youth is fading fast
These times won't last and once they're gone they don't come back

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hands
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

Attention all personnel!
Stand single file, resistance is futile!
We're gonna raise your hopes up
Just to knock them down
You got a bright bright future
If you can shut your mouth
And if you work the front lines
To keep us safe and sound
You won't be compensated
Until you're in the ground
So don't waste a single breath
On what society expects
If history don't lie
They're gonna take you for a ride until you die!

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hands
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command
