The gun is loaded when the glass is full
Down the hatch and the trigger's pulled
Off the wagon and back onto the stool
I know that when I stare into your eyes
I can see all the years of lies
Ghosts and demons you never exorcised

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone

Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

His fate was written on a neon sign
A DUI never changed his mind
He got hooked like a fish caught on a line
You never gave yourself a chance to shine
Your destination's a chalk outline
And when you get to the gates you'll be denied

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone

Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
The tide keeps pulling me down
I try to reach higher ground
I'll never give up and drown

Even though I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Tears into wine
Tears into wine
Well, I'll just turn these tears into wine
