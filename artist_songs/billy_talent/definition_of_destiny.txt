Won't you stop, take a breath
Find a moment to reflect
On the pure and simple choices that we fail to see

From the worst to the best
From the east coast to the west
On a never-ending quest to end our misery

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go, 
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)

Punch the clock to a own
While our lives are put on hold
When did all our childhood dreams begin to disappear?

Well a long time ago
We had passion, we had goals
Why is life so set in stone it doesn't have to be?

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go, 
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)

o get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go, 
The future's unknown.

Along the way, we lost our way
So will you change or stay the same?
So in between, reality
And fantasy is destiny

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go, 
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)

Yeah take back control, and don't let it go, 
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
'Cause I got my own
Yeah I got my own
Yeah I got my own(definition of destiny)
