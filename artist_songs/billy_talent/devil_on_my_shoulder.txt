As I get closer, my dreams get farther
I climb that ladder, but you kick it over
Thirsty for water, you give me vinegar
When I drink your medicine, it just makes me sicker

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)
And I just can't sink any lower (lower and lower)
The hounds of hell are getting closer (closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)

Follow the rainbow, my lucky omen
There ain't no pot of gold, just copper tokens
I found the key to life, the lock was broken
All my accomplishments, are best left unspoken

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)
And I just can't sink any lower (lower and lower)
The hounds of hell are getting closer (closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)

My horror story is nearly over
I said I'm sorry, but I was sober
I beg for mercy from my infernal friend
The one that drops the nails into my coffin

I got the devil on my shoulder
I got the devil on my shoulder

I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)
And I just can't sink any lower (lower and lower)
They come to take me, take me over (closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (over and over)
