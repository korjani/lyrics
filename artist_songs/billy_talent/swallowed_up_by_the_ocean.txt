We spent a life together
That should have last forever
But now it's time to sail on 

So take this anchor from my heart
So we can finally drift apart 
Before we drown in sorrow 

I gave you sanctuary 
Under the sun we lived care free
I tried so hard to love you

But then you turned your back on me
Your good intentions turned to greed 
And now it's good to know that you have been 

Swallowed up by the ocean 
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up 

The bluest skies turn into gray 
Through tortured eyes I watched you change 
A paradise went up in flames 

And though I cried a thousand times 
You didn't hear the rising tide
There's nowhere left to hide since you have been

Swallowed up by the ocean 
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up 

Your devastation took its toll
As the waves came crashing to the coast
This sinking ship I'm taking back from your control 
It felt so good to cross my arms and renounce my faith in mankind
How could you ever be so blind to think that you'd survive?

Swallowed up by the ocean 
Swallowed up by the ocean
I hope you know that nothing matters now that you have been
Swallowed up by the ocean 
Swallowed up by the ocean 
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
I hope you know someday this ship will be your end
