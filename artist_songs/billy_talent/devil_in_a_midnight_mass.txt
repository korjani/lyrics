A devil in a midnight mass,
He prayed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive but now I'm singing

[Chorus:]
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
Forgive me Father... won't make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
(You're guilty!)

A devil in a midnight mass,
killed the boy inside the man.
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Put my trust in God that day
Not the man that taught his way
I was alive but now I'm singing

[Chorus]

[Whispered]
Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
Your bed is made and it's in the ground [x2]

[Screamed]
Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
Your bed is made and it's in the ground [x4]
