Well I'm scared of my reflection
Is it mine or is it yours?
And I swear I hear them knocking
But there's no one at the door.

Don't think I'm losing my perspective
'Cause I know one thing for sure
They've been watching, they've been listening
Every whisper, every word

Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away

Terrified by information
Who's the black sheep of the herd?
I am the guardian of angels
And they'll get what they deserve

So lock your children in the basement
Keep a rifle by the door
Don't be afraid of my intentions
'Cause I'm more afraid of yours

Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away

Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away

Blow us all away
Blow us all away

Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away

Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away
