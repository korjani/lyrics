Rejected...since day one
My name is...bastard son
I've been damned...so many times I've lost count!
Blue collar...working man
Devises...masterplan
Bi-polar...with a mental side arm

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
They'll think I'm insane but you'll all know my name!
Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
I'll take all the blame, the front page and the fame!

Contraption...made up of
Nuts and bolts...creates the
New monster...to burn your family tree down!
Tick-tocking...times up now
Split second...the world frowns
Lonely heart...never had nobody!

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
They'll think I'm insane but you'll all know my name!
Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
I'll take all the blame, the front page and the fame!

I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below

Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
They'll think I'm insane but you'll all know my name!
Into the river below...I'm running from the inferno...
I'll take all the blame, the front page and the fame!

Yeah I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
But you'll all know my name
And you'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
But you'll think I'm insane
