Constant quick fixes, don't make no sense
Hop on bandwagons, you make me sick

Don't you tell me, what you think is right!
(When you're living in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight!
(When you're living in the shadows)
[x2]

Distant loud chuckles, keep me awake
Awkward instances won't make you hip

Don't you tell me, what you think is right!
(When you're living in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight!
(When you're living in the shadows)
[x2]

We've said this all before, your shadow's at the door
We've said this all before, your shadow's at the door
There's darkness in the hall and we won't take the fall!
And we won't take the fall!

Don't you tell me, what you think is right!
(When you're living in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight!
(When you're living in the shadows)
