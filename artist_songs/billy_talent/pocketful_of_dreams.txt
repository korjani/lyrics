Vanities are only charity
And she makes donations at the Tiffany's,
Life is hard without a credit card to get by, get by
She sold her dreams for security
To a man that now she hardly ever sees
With a cold martini in her hand, she don't mind, don't mind

So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh

If you design a plastic happiness,
Then climb the social ladder to the top my friend,
And don't forget to thank the piggy bank in the sky, so high

So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs,
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
you're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh
