Alive, and right before your eyes
It’s easy to think twice
A choice can change your life

Angry fists, angry eyes
Thought you’d take them by surprise
And unleash all your demons upon them
With your guns, and your knives
Left them fighting to survive
You’re the villain, but you play the victim

Never took no advice
Did you ever realize
That your violence had taken your virtue?
Well, you can’t wash away
The mistakes of yesterday
When the boys wearing blue
Come to greet you.

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down

Did you stop and regret
When the voice inside your head
Got so quiet, that you’d hear a pin drop?
Did you still like the view
When the guns were aimed at you
Screaming, "Out of the house with your hands up!"?
Now you wait in the line,
For the prison bell to chime
Singing “I fought the law but the law won”
When you’re done serving time
You can look them in the eyes
While you count all the lives that you’ve broken

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down

And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are rolling down your mother’s face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Someday you’ll see the life that you turned down

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down

And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are rolling down your mother’s face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Someday you’ll see the life that you turned down

Alive, and right before your eyes
It’s easy to think twice
A choice can change your life.
