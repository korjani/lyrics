You spurn my natural emotions.
you make me feel like dirt, and it hurts.
And if I start a commotion, 
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse.

Ever fallen in love with somoene
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone 
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame.
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same.

Ever fallen in love with somoene
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone 
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

You discern my natural emotions
you make me feel like dirt, and it hurts.
And if I start a commotion, 
I'll only end up losin' you and that's worse.

Ever fallen in love with somoene
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone 
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?
