Everybody is tired and poor and sick of trying
If you see me on the corner
Will you stop or will you splash me
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

Shitty weather, bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it...

This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes

So unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Turn 'em into, turn 'em into doubts

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
