We're living underneath the land of sorrow
I can hear the bombs rain down
And how do I explain there's no tomorrow
I can hardly make a sound

Dead silence
A fate we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

They're marching up the main street
As my heart beats
Louder then machine gun fire
The sound of all the sirens sing like violins
Rattling the cold barbwire
I heard the soldiers say
"Don't let them get away"
But I could not escape their bullets and grenades
A casuality of war
A victim of mistake
Another widow has been made

Dead silence
Will come to rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
A fate we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

Dead silence
Will come to rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
No time to be afraid
My love
I will see
You again

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Fly away like the wind
Some things God can't forgive
Why is war justified
While the innocent die

They can tear us apart
I'll still live in your heart
If your spirit gives up
Don't surrender your love

And the world will survive
If we stand side by side
One day hope will arrive
Now I must say goodbye

Dead silence
Will come to rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
I think we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

Dead silence
Will come to rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
No time to be afraid
My love
I will see
You again

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence
