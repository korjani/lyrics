We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
Masters of broken promises are born to manipulate
Your mind is a vault of prejudice but we see through the door
Your dirty little secrets aren't so secret anymore

We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
You're tied to an ideology from a book that's out of date
No room for your daft intolerance left in this day and age
We're not gonna go down quietly, we're not gonna be afraid

Cause under the cloak of sanities are madmen in disguise
Are we blind, blind, blind?

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
It's a lie!

We're slamming the doors of democracy on those who are not the same
We're casting the stones of liberty, but no one takes the blame
Your cup is full of promise, but there's nothing left in mine
Tell me why, why, why?

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We're gonna make it like a thief in the night
(Are we blind?) We'll uncover up the evidence of their crimes
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)
(It's a lie!) Well, they told me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie!) I surrendered the fight, I surrendered the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)

And what I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes
And I don't need to be tied
To the edge of your knife!

And what I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We're gonna make it like a thief in the night
(Are we blind?) We'll uncover up the evidence of their crimes
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)
(It's a lie!) Well, they told me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie!) I surrendered the fight, I surrendered the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)
A big fucking lie!
