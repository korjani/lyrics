I know you can't stand my wandering hands,
But how can I apologize, comply with my demands?
They're written on these pages, it's written on our faces.
I know you don't want this, but know that I need this more than I did before.
It's easy to see that it's hard to ignore your subtle hints.
I'm catching wind. How insincere are your finger prints?

So make me promises, girl, the kind I know you can't keep
And while I'm losing my mind, I hope you're home finding sleep.
But you and I both know that that's not the case
Because the look on your face gives all your secrets away.

Can we talk this over? At least just for tonight.
I asked myself one hundred times
Why did we even bother? Why did we even try?
But I miss you more than I did before.
I showed you my heart and you showed me the door.
Your subtle hints, I'm catching wind. How insincere are your finger prints?

So make me promises, girl, the kind I know you can't keep.
And while I'm losing my mind, I hope you're home finding sleep.
But you and I both know that that's not the case
because the look on your face gives all your secrets away.

I've been waiting for a good time to decide whether I was wrong or right.
Are you getting sick of the ride because I'm driving you out of your mind?

Girl, remember you're mine, girl.
