Let's leave these lives tonight
You can find us by the trail of our insides
They were left at the scene of the crime
We've tampered with evidence 
Finger prints were left behind

So lets cut cut cut to the chase
We need to get get get our story straight
This is what were hoping
Covers blown wide open
We can make a run for it 
We can make a run for it
We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

Complex calculated overlooked and underrated
We've got this down
We've got this down

So lets cut cut cut to the chase
We need to get get get our story straight
This is what were hoping
Covers blown wide open
We can make a run for it 
We can make a run for it
We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

We'll lure you in
Set you up
To take our fall
And now its over

Complex calculated overlooked and underrated
We'll lure you in
Set you up
We've got this down
To take our fall
We've got this down
And now its over
Now it's over

We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

We've got this down to a science baby (don't be afraid)
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby (we don't make mistakes)
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make
