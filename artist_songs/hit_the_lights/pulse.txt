It might be the light bouncing off of your cheeks
But tonight, I got these urges to taste you like you wouldn't believe
Could be the night with the color of your skin that excites
If this isn't love it shouldn't be, I swore it never again

So tie me up, take my pulse before I lose control
We could get ahead
Could lose it under sheets instead 
Cause we're alone
And you know
That I can't wait to go home
And wake up yet again,
Broken bloody in my bed

Cause with you I fall apart
Like every single time I come unglued
Don't know what to do
I can't keep up with you I fall apart
Never again is what I said
But tonight
You're coming over me

I got these scars with the promise to keep 
And it shows
Forget this feeling
I'll take it to where ever it goes
And its alright if we just take turns on taking it slow
Or if its love we can speed it up whenever we know
So tie me up, take my pulse before I lose control
We could get ahead
Could lose it in the sheets instead
Cause we're alone
And you know that I can't wait to go home
And wake up yet again,
Broken bloody in my bed

Cause with you I fall apart
Like every single time I come unglued
Don't know what to do
I can't keep up with you
I fall apart
Never again is what I said
But tonight
You're coming over

Me and you
All the trouble we could get into
If this is only but the start of it
Then I'm hooked
Waiting on another dose of me and you
I'm addicted

Cause with you I fall apart
Like every single time I come unglued
Don't know what to do
I can't keep up with you
I fall apart
Never again is what I said
But tonight
You're coming over
