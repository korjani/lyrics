You play this game so well
So well in fact that they can tell
But we're on to you (lets go)
Cause your act is nothing new (yeah)
And we can see right through it now
Your method's old, worn and used

So if you (swallow your pride)
Should decide to (spill your insides)
Take your time, find your spine
I swear you'll be just fine
If your backbone should find its way home
Through the hole above your neck (is where the trap is set)

You look so obvious... predictable...
And some day your games will catch up to you
So obvious...
And we all know
That some day your games will catch up
Right now

You thought I'd fall for your lies 
You thought I'd cut off all ties
Anymore gutless and you'd be dead

You show me yours, I'll show you mine
You know sincerity grows in time
Sing it with me if you can (show a little backbone)

So if you (swallow your pride)
Should decide to (spill your insides)
Take your time, find your spine
I swear you'll be just fine
If your backbone should find its way home
Through the hole above your neck (is where the trap is set)

You look so obvious... predictable...
And some day your games will catch up to you
So obvious...
And we all know
That some day your games will catch up

So carve your apologies in your wrists
Let the guilt drip from your fingertips
I'm on to you, we're on to you
Now wrap this excuse around your neck
And I'll kick the chair out from your legs
I'm on to you, we're on to you

So obvious... predictable...
And some day your games will catch up

Obvious... predictable...
And some day your games will catch up to you
So obvious... (So obvious, predictable)
And we all know (we all know)
That some day your games will catch up (Some day your games will catch up)
That some day your games will catch up
Right now
