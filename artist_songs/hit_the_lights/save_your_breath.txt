Save your breath this time around
You're too beautiful and it's late
There's nothing left to say
I've wasted all this time on you
On you

It's all the same, we all make mistakes
And if you didn't notice, I'm taking this for all its worth
If it's a game, and these are the stakes
I know I got the best shot, for taking you out of the race

And every time I think of him it makes me sick
And I don't wanna know just what happened then
In the van right in front of my house
That's where you sold me out, girl
You didn't have a clue

You sold me out
What'd you think about when you were telling all your friends
about how your lips were pressed against his tightly
And I hope you (had your eyes closed)

And every time I think of him it makes me sick
And I don't wanna know just what happened then
In the van right in front of my house
That's where you sold me out, girl
You didn't have a clue

What'd you think about when you sold me out?

Every time you go to sleep at night
I wonder what you hide behind closed eyes
What else could you be keeping from me?
What else could you be keeping from me?

And every time you go to sleep at night
I wonder what you hide behind closed eyes
What else could you be keeping from me?
What else could you be keeping from me?

And every time I think of him it makes me sick
And I don't wanna know just what happened then
In the van right in front of my house
That's where you sold me out, girl
You didn't have a clue

And every time I think of him it makes me sick
And I don't wanna know just what happened then
In the van right in front of my house
That's where you sold me out, girl
You didn't have a clue
