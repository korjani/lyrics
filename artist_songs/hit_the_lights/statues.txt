They'll build statues in our likeness
They wanted to be like us
But did they ever like us anyway?

(We always) gave em the cold shoulder
Our shoulders just got colder
They deserve an elbow to the face

I'll build this monument just to tear it down
(Tear it down now)
And dedicate it to this bitter town and this broken sound

And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"
And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"
Wish you were here

I'll build a throne
Made from the bones
Of those who died searching for gold
Just to find it's found inside our hearts

"What a jip"
You'll hear them say
Tossing, turning in their graves
All this time searching in vain for what?

Blowing kisses to the masses
In this ticker-tape parade
We're saints of this backseat
Swear to God we've got it made
(Got it made)

And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"
And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"
I wish you were here

Today, we're making history
Tonight, we'll take it to the streets
Tomorrow, we'll live in infamy
We're under attack
Pull the knife from our backs and hold it to their throats

And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"
And I'll send postcards to enemies
Made sure to sign and date each one while singing
"Wish you were here"

They'll build statues in our likeness
They wanted to be like us
But did they ever like us anyway?
