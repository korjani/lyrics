I've been thinking, let get out of this party yeah let's flee
These kids never meant much to me
I'll get this started, first shot is the hardest to deal with
So let's sober up on the drive home
Let's go some place where the cops will leave us alone

And we'll stay out all night
'Cause rest is for the dead
So we won't stop, no we won't stop
Raise your glass high
And let's throw out a toast to the road, where ever we go
We'll hold friends close and never want to go home

I've been hearing you've been talking to my boys all wrong
And giving us looks all night long
Get your coat, time to go, hit the road
You can find us hiding in headstones

So let's sober up on the drive home
Let's go some place where the cops will leave us alone
'Cause tonight is like you and I
So alive and too young, too young to die

Stay out all night
'Cause rest is for the dead
So we won't stop, no we won't stop
Raise your glass high
And let's throw out a toast to the road, where ever we go
We'll hold friends close and never want to go home

Let's break the bottles in well lit parking lots
I know it's not much but it's all I've got
We'll break the bottles in well lit parking lots
I know it's not much but it's all we've got
