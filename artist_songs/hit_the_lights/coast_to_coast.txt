And we're back for another year, we're still here
To build it tough, back it up, and tear it apart
We'll take the hype to the clubs (see what these kids are made of)
This scene can't break us, when veteran halls raised us

When we're days away,
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her lately
And you know, it won't be long 'till I'm coming home
Truth be told, no matter where we go, we'll always have the shows

No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me

Looking back on the past year
We've come up and faced the clubs,
The dirty pubs, and we didn't care
We live for cheers, sweat and blood
It's the scars that make us
We leave them open, we've got the guts to show it

When we're days away,
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her lately
And you know, it won't be long 'till I'm coming home
Truth be told, no matter where we go, we'll always have these shows

No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me

We're just chasing the same, we guess the city by name,
We take it back to the start, we don't forget
We know where we are from, we know how far we have come
We know we wouldn't be anywhere at all without you

When we're days away,
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her

No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me

No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me
