Wake up and let go
Of these feelings that I've had for you
It's easier said than done
So give up (give up) and let go (let go)
Of these feelings that I've had for you
Why couldn't you be the one?

'Cause it's a guilty pleasure
Deciding whether you were ever mine or not
But the truth's apparent
That you weren't ever mine to start

What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you
What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you

So don't close your eyes

Every night I kept you up
I never once heard you say stop
But right now I wish I had 
I wish I had the nerve to tell you that I'm a wreck
But what really did you expect?
You never listened to what I said to you (what I said to you)

'Cause it's a guilty pleasure
Deciding whether you were ever mine or not
But the truth's apparent
That you weren't ever mine to start

What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you
What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you (I need you)

Now this broken shell of a boy
Falls to pieces with no choice
At the sound of her voice he falls apart
Now this broken shell of a boy
Falls to pieces with no choice
At the sound of her voice he falls apart, 
He falls apart, he falls apart, he falls apart...

What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you
What will it take to make you understand that I
I'm not lying when I say I need you

I need you
