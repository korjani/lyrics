You're gonna need a bodybag, 
I'll break bones you didn't know you had.
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you 
for your friends to hold on to 
when they find you cold and blue tonight, 
face down in a parking lot.

Next time around, think about what you say 
before you run your mouth. 
Cause you're all alone and you're nothing 
without your friends now. 
You can tell the pavement what you really said
but I already know. 
You got another thing coming if you think you're walking home.

This time I'm waiting here for you, you got nowhere to hide

Here's a question. 
What do you do when you're all alone 
and you have nowhere to run to, swear I'll find you.
And this is what I'll do; I'll take it slow (I'll take it slow)
just to let you know that we're not playing, you're not walking home.

This time I'm waiting here for you, you got nowhere to hide

You're gonna need a bodybag,
I'll break bones you didn't know you had.

Did you think that you had something to prove, 
well you do yea, you do yea. 
Did you think that you had nothing to lose, 
well you do so you think you're walking home.
