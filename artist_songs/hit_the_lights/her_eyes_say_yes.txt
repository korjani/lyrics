You don't know how much I adore
this damp rag soaked in chloroform
It makes me so hard to ignore
cause I could never keep your attention
I'm not one to make threats
I've been reduced to promises
I lie to myself cause I do it best
I'm not honest with my intentions

So when the blindfold starts to slip
and the rope starts to rip
and I slowly start to give
and girl, you know I'm sorry

But tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
to poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly so I can be the last thing you see

you'll see

Girl you're busy and that's fine
but there's one thing I gotta get off my mind
I won't take too much of your time
I promise this won't last long, no
I used to be your biggest fan,
you used to say I was your man
Now if I can't have you no one can
I'll be the last boy you hang up on

So when the blindfold starts to slip
and the rope starts to rip
and I slowly start to give
and girl, you know I'm sorry

But tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
to poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly so I can be the last thing you see

oh you'll see

She's losing consciousness
I'm gaining confidence
It's starting to make sense, woah-oh woah-oh
She's covered in finger prints
From her lips to her hips
All I wanted was one more kiss, woah-oh woah-oh
[x2]

Tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
to poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly (die slowly) so I can be the last thing you see
I pray you die slowly (die slowly) so I can be the last thing you see
I pray you die slowly so I can be the last thing you see
