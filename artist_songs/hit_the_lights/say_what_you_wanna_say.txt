Out of friends
At an end for sure
When you've got no side to side with
You'll deal with that

It's a waste
Time it takes if you think that I
Ever want a confession or an alibi

Just say what you wanna say
It's not gonna change anything
You've got it wrong
Go ahead and blame who you wanna blame
It's not gonna change anything
So say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say

Turn it on
Crank it up
Get what's coming to ya
You let your friends down
Let me tell you how
Aftermath
Payback 'cause talk is cheap
You'll lose your bite trading teeth in for your enemies

Say what you wanna say
It's not gonna change anything
You've got it wrong
Go ahead and blame who you wanna blame
It's not gonna change anything

Turn it on
Crank it up
Get what's coming to ya
You let your friends down
You let your friends down

I take it back
Take back every single word I wrote about you
I take it back
Take back every single time I stuck my neck out
And let my guard down
Time I could have spent on anything other than you

Say what you wanna say
It's not gonna change anything
You've got it wrong
Go ahead and blame who you wanna blame
It's not gonna change anything, anything

Say what you wanna say
It's not gonna change anything
You've got it wrong
Go ahead and blame who you wanna blame
It's not gonna change anything

Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say
