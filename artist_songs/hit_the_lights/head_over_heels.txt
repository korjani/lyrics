I miss the way you make me feel
So cold and alone, so cold and alone.
I miss the way you make me wait
By the telephone to tell you I'm trying to get by
Learning how to tie my own noose
Because you win and I lose
It's been so hard but you've been so smooth

So play it off and pretend
You never know what you got yourself into
I'll play it off and pretend
I never meant a word I said
'Cause I'm starting to realize
That getting lost in your eyes
Was the worst move
'Cause you win and I lose

And forever isn't long enough
To get over giving so much up
To someone who will throw it all away
And a smile can only hide so much
And I choose death over your touch
I fell head over heels into my grave

I count my lucky stars
I thank God I've seen a smile like yours
But don't take it as a compliment
Just know it's straight from the heart
Now I'm driving around yeah to get lost
Just to find myself at any cost
If I hit the brakes my heart will stop
I'm taking comfort in the dark
I keep saying I know you're not mine
But I'm praying that you'll be alright
Because it's hard to let go of the ones you love
And I keep hoping for the best
As this wound heals in my chest
I know one day my best will be enough

I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone
So cold and alone
I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone
So cold and alone
I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone
So cold and alone
I miss the way you make me feel
Alright

And forever isn't long enough
To get over giving so much up
To someone who will throw it all away
And a smile can only hide so much
And I choose death over your touch
I fell head over heels into my grave
Well I fell head over heels into my grave
I fell head over heels into my
