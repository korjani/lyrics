Anytime you talk 
It's all time used
So you can prove
How big your mouth is.
(Oh the lies that leave those lips)

You've got them dropping like cancer, baby
Colder than ever.
And that's why I'll say

That even if I wanted you back
(And I don't),
You'd still be on call tonight
For anyone who's down.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my while 
And cry your eyes out,
Baby, cry your eyes out.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my time
And cry about
Cry about it.

Any word I bought was sold by you,
So tell me how you deal with dead ends.
(Oh the lies that lead those hips)

You've got me sweating a heart attack,
Coming from all the stress you put me through.

And even if I wanted you back
(And I don't),
You'd still be on call tonight
For anyone who's down.
I've had it.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my while 
And cry your eyes out,
Baby, cry your eyes out.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my time
And cry about
Cry about it.

Cry about it now,
It's not like anyone's supposed to know
You were here making 
More messes for yourself

So figure out your damage 
And own up to what was said.
Save your excuses,
I'm not hearing it.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my while 
And cry your eyes out,
Baby, cry your eyes out.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my time
And cry your eyes out,
Baby, cry your eyes out.

Every time you call for some sympathy,
Make it worth my time
And cry about
Cry about it.

(Oh the lies that leave those lips)...
