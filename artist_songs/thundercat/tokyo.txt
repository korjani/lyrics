Restless nights in Tokyo
Wanna hear all the sounds and see all the sights
From the Champs-Élysées to the Gundam Cafe
Gonna eat so much fish I think I'm gonna be sick
Gonna blow all my cash on anime (Yes!)
Don't try to stop me 'cause I'm over 9000
Just point me to the pachinko machines
I think I'm Kenshiro, I think that I'm Goku
Can I just stay one more day?

Reckless nights in Tokyo
Oh my God, it's Tokyo

It was premeditated, tried to get someone pregnant
It wasn't her fault, I'm just kind of psychotic
Left on my own, I would never come back
I'd probably hide in the suicide forest (Shit!)
This all started when I was a boy
I went to the dentist and he gave me a toy
It was Dragon Ball Z, a wrist-slap bracelet
Goku fucking ruined me

A love affair with Tokyo
