I want to go right, I'm safe on my block
Except for the cops
Will they attack?
Would it be 'cause I'm black
I want to fly away off into space and into the sun
With all those spirits and space space dust and aliens
Where we belong

(Fuck yeah!)

Although it seems like it's all crashing down
I just want to ride my bike
Through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
Miss me with that nonsense
I'm free as a bird (free)
And light as the wind
Just leave me alone (easy)
Just let me ride off into space (space ride)
That's where I want to be (space ride)
