Here it comes
In and out and around
Feeling bare
Almost there
Here it comes
This is the best part
This is the best part
Getting weak
But I'm doing fine
How are you?
How are you?
Everything and nothing
Twirling around in my head
All at once
All at once

Where am I going?
Can you take me with you?
Can you take me with you?
