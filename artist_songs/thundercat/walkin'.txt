When it's just you and me
There's no place I'd rather be
You make my days bright as the sun
Each moment with you I adore
Cause' there is no one like you girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
I can't keep my cool

Lalalalalala...

There's nothing I wouldn't do
To put myself closer to you
Every time that I look in your eyes
I see a reflection of me
Don't ever leave me alone
Without you where would I be?

Lalalalalala...
