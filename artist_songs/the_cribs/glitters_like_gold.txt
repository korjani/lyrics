It's so strange seeming
Like a friend's mother's perfume
That you can be what you want.
Anointed genius, poets, good fucks
Yeah you can be what you want
Anyway
Getting the feeling, spent all my splendour long ago
And though I rarely see it
Your other side glitters like gold.

It never shows that my
Mind will always fight me
With both sides claiming victory
Kiss my stiff upper lip and forever release me
Vanity dance around me
Whatever you think about me
I'm the whale beneath the ship
Who would ever believe me?

Should I say something?
It seems they'd like me better
If I just sing nonsense
Anyway
Never written honest, though sometimes I think I should
But to share these feelings
Would only hurt the ones I love.

They know enough that my
Mind will always fight me
With both sides claiming victory
Kiss my stiff upper lip and forever release me
Vanity dance around me
Whatever you think about me
I'm the whale beneath the ship
Who would ever believe me?

I guess I got what you wanted
A naive streak that I won't shake
Keeps me cold

My mind will always fight me
With both sides claiming victory
Kiss my stiff upper lip and forever release me
Vanity dance around me
Whatever you think about me
I'm not half the kid I used to be
Who would ever believe me?
