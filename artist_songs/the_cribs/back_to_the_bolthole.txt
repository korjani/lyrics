You follow Aurora and hope no-one saw you,
Peel back the screen door like everyone before,
Cartoons run on repeat in the room across the street,
So you go out to find her in some crappy roadside diner.

You’re a long long way from home.
And as the room goes cold you’re…

Crying in secret about the things you’re thinking
On a night.
That you, one day will die.
Just try to think it’s the one thing
That makes it all worthwhile.
That I, one day will die.

So where do we go?

We go back to the Bolthole.
Crack open the Rainiers.
The oxygen makes you thin here.
A Cascadian rainfall.
The couch has gone AWOL.
It’s as good place as any to forget about your family.

You’re a long long way from home.
And as the room goes cold you’re…

Crying in secret about the things you’re thinking
On a night.
That you, one day will die.
Just try to think it’s the one thing
That makes it all worthwhile.
That I, one day will die.
