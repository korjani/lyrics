A strange union the other day
It's a dead Russian, the papers say
But it would be nice if they realised
That she thought 'he is mine'

This town has got you down and I know
I was helping you out
While your hope died under northern skies
and it shows
I was helping you to realise
The reason why, it was no surprise
No way

The act will pass by no-one
And I'm sad to say it's no different today
Be comforted by we share the same skies
And for once pay no mind 

I have decided it's best that you know
I'm still thinking about
Old ties as north-west skies grow cold
No point in denying
Anxiety was my favourite feeling after jealousy
Yeah, I'll concede

That I could not be as nervous as I was
I could not, no way
