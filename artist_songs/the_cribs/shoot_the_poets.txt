Cut off your nose despite your friends 
Breathing holes that will never end and 
Speak all you want or just pretend 
Cos she think she is a different class 
So she sits all day by the looking glass, oh 
It doesn't talk, it doesn't last 

But it's not what I've heard you know 
A picture speaks a thousand words 
But baby don't feel down 
I left my heart in the provincial town, yeah 

You sold your soul for magic beans 
Don't believe all you read on computer screens and 
These things they mean nothing to me 
Rimpton stain came off the track 
You go there once and you don't come back, oh 

Good that's what I say 

But it's not what I've heard you know it 
Cut your losses, shoot the poets 
And one day you'll come down 
To find yourself in the provincial town 

But it's not what I've heard you know 
A picture speaks a thousand words 
But baby don't feel down 
I left my heart in the provincial town, yeah 

But it's not what I've heard you know it 
Cut your losses, shoot the poets 
And one day you'll come down 
Oh, to find yourself in the provincial town
