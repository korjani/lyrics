In a radius of a thousand miles
I find it strange no one makes me smile

You should understand
You still have to try
When we're all the same
I was almost right

And evening comes and I feel no different
Sorry my friend, I just can't do nothing
Evening comes and I feel no different
Sorry my friend, I just can't do nothing

In a radius of a thousand miles
You find it strange no one makes me smile

You should understand
You still have to try
We're not all the same
I was almost right

And see those guys I guess they're quite clever
Get you outside
Women's needs, whatever
See those guys they think they're so clever
Spot them outside
Women's needs, whatever

And evening comes and I feel no better
It's closing time
Women's needs, whatever
Evening comes and I feel no better
It's closing time
Women's needs, whatever
