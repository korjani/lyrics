I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I'm an indecisive piece of shit

I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I am indecisive and that's about it

And you dream that's the same thing
That's the same life you lead
I don't agree and so you drink
Don't wanna think
That's 'cause your mind is already made up

I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I'm an indecisive piece of shit

I admit it
I'm up to my old tricks
Did you see her eyes (Oh no I tried)
She looked surprised

And you dream that's the same thing
that's the same life you lead
I don't agree and so you drink
Don't wanna think
That's 'cause your mind is already made up

How you dream that's the same thing
That's the same life you lead
I don't agree and so you drink
Don't wanna think
That's 'cause your mind is already made up
No

I know that it's only a matter of time
Before you know it
I'll be leaving town, see it in my eyes
That no one will do
No one will ever do

I know that it's only a matter of time
Before you know it
I'll be leaving town, seen it in your eyes
That no one will ever do
No one will ever do for you
