Chances are we're gonna leave now
Sorry for the victim now
Though my days are filled with sorrow
I see years of pride tomorrow

Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are, hang on right now
Though-oh-oh-oh my-my days are filled with sorrow
I see years of pride tomorrow

Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are, hang on right now
Chances are, oh chances, you're my chances
Chances are, hang on right now

Chances are, hang on right now

Heal with loneliness,
Heartaches and tear drops
Chances are we'll have to win
Chances are, hang on right now
Chances are, chances are...
