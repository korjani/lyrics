I'll play your fav'rite song, darlin'.
We can rock it all night long, darlin'.
'Cause I've got love, darlin',
Love, sweet love, darlin'.
Mellow mood has got me,
So let the music rock me.

'Cause I've got love, darlin'.
Love, sweet love, darlin'.
Quiet as the night,
Please turn off your light.

I'll play your fav'rite song, darlin'.
We can rock it all night long, darlin'.

Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Open up your heart.
Open up your heart.
Let love come running in, darlin',
Love, sweet love, darlin'.
Love, sweet love, darlin'.

Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Strike the hammer while iron is hot.
Open up your heart.
Open up your heart.
Let love come running in, darlin',
Love, sweet love, darlin'.
Love, sweet love, darlin'.

Mellow mood has got me, darlin'.
Let the music rock me, darlin'.
'Cause I got your love, darlin'.
Love, sweet love, darlin'.

Love, sweet love, darlin'.
Love, sweet love, darlin'.
