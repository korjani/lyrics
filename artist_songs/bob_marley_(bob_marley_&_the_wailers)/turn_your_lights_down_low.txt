Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtains;
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in -
Into our life again,
Sayin': ooh, it's been a long, long (long, long, long, long) time;
I kept this message for you, girl,
But it seems I was never on time;
Still I wanna get through to you, girlie,
On time - on time.
I want to give you some love (good, good lovin');
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin').
Oh, I - oh, I - oh, I,
Say, I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin'):
Turn your lights down low;
Never try to resist, oh no!
Oh, let my love come tumbling in -
Into our life again,
Sayin': ooh, I love ya!
And I want you to know right now,
I love ya!
And I want you to know right now,
'Cause I - that I -
I want to give you some love, oh-ooh!
I want to give you some good, good lovin';
Oh, I - I want to give you some love;
Sayin': I want to give you some good, good lovin':
Turn your lights down low, wo-oh!
Never - never try to resist, oh no!
Ooh, let my love - ooh, let my love come tumbling in -
Into our life again.
Oh, I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin').
