Your love is dripping down my body
Mouth to mouth so sweet like candy
Everyday you're gone I start to disappear
Melting like ice cream I need you here

So tasty don't waste me
Unwrap me to the floor
So crazy amazing
Don't stop just give me more

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Your lips are feeling so icy
Go down and start to paralyze me
And underneath this shiny surface
You make me feel so fucking perfect

Cherry cola through my veins
Our love rush straight to my brain
So crazy amazing
Don't stop just give me more

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Let's put our lips together and hold hands forever
Let's put our lips together and hold hands always and forever

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
