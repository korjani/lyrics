Down below, down below
Caught the devil talking to his son
Who wanted to go up above, up above
He cried, "It's getting to warm for me down here and so,
I'm going up to Earth where I can have a little fun."
The devil slowly smiled and then he answered his son

[Chorus:]
"Stay down here where you belong
The folks who live above you don't know right from wrong
To please their king, they've all gone out to war
And not one of them knows what he's fighting for
Way up above they say that I'm a devil and I'm bad
Kings up there are bigger devils than your dad
Breaking the hearts of mothers, making butchers of their brothers
You'll find more heat up there than there is down below"

"Kings up there, they don't care
For the mothers who must stay at home, their troubles to bear
Stay at home, don't you roam
Although it's warm down here, it's warmer up there
If you go way up there, my son, I know you'll be surprised
You'll find a lot of people who are not civilized"

[Chorus]
