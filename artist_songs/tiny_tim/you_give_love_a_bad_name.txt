Shot through the heart, and you're to blame, darling
You give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free

You're a loaded gun, yeah
There's nowhere to run
No-one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart, and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

You paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boys dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

You're a loaded gun
There's nowhere to run
No-one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart, and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name

You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
