Is there anybody there? Anybody there?
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about a girl who came to stay
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day

Woe, girl girl girl
Girl girl girl
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She would turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why.

Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl
She's the kinda girl that puts you down when friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good she acts as if she's understood
Its cool
Girl girl girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you understand woman, what I do for you?
How I'd break my back and sweat
Worthless little thing
Why am I wasting time on you?

Girl, girl can't ya hear me?
Where are ya,ya little devil?
Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl

Why didn't your mother bring you up right?
