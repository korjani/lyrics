Hey Babe
Remember all of those nights
When you told me that you had to work late
Think back
To the times you stood me up
And the countless broken dates

I got tired of the aggravation
So I made a reservation
A special evening I planned just for you

Party of one at a table for two
Waitin' on me like I waited on you
I can just see you now
I can picture your face
Checkin' your watch
Feelin' so out of place
Now you're gonna find out how it feels
To be so lonesome and blue
Bein' a party of one at a table for two

Hey babe
By now you must be wonderin'
What the heck is taken' so long
you think
I'm probably stuck in traffic
But boy you couldn't be more wrong
I call and tell you that I'll be later
I left a message with your waiter
Says, I hope you enjoy your night alone, bein'...

Party of one at a table for two
Waitin' on me like I waited on you
I can just see you now
I can picture your face
Checkin' your watch
Feelin' so out of place
Now you're gonna find out how it feels
To be so lonesome and blue
Bein' a party of one at a table for two

Thought maybe messin' with your mind
Might teach you a lesson this time
Surely you're smart enough to know
You always reap what you sow

Party of one at a table for two
Waitin' on me like I waited on you
I can just see you now
I can picture your face
Checkin' your watch
Feelin' so out of place
Now you're gonna find out how it feels
To be so lonesome and blue
Bein' a party of one at a table for two
