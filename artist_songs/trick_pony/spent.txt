People in line got a real good laugh
When I pumped two dollars worth of premium gas
Money down the drain
(It's all I could afford)

A twist off bottle and tall boy can
In a brown paper sack from the quick stop man
Got a hand full of change
(It's all I could afford)

I ain't got no dough (dough) no (no)
I get it and it goes
Like the water flows outta my hands (hands)
Uncle Sam (Sam)
I want you to know the money's done

Spent (no it just don't last)
Yeah it goes too fast (it ain't coming back)
I don't know where it went (spent it on your friends)
All I know is it gets spent (yeah it just gets spent)
Yeah, the money gets spent

Tried my ATM card, county bank
It flashed me no funds
Even told me no thanks
Wouldn't give it back to me
(it's all I could afford)

Yeah I went to go buy me a brand new dress
But the man behind the counter wouldn't take my check
Said theirs nothin' for free
(it's all I could afford)

I'd like to take a vacation (hey) to the islands (ho)
I'd love to take you where the water's so blue
Bring Mama (mama) to the Bahamas ('Hamas)
But no can do 'cause the money i'd use is

Spent (no it just don't last)
Yeah it goes too fast (it ain't coming back)
I don't know where it went (spent it on your friends)
All I know is it gets spent (yeah it just gets spent)
Yeah, the money gets spent

There's people walkin' 'round in the world out there
Just wishing they could have what we got here
But you can't buy love like a lotta people think
'Cause when it comes to us just as fast as we can make it... it gets spent

Spent (no it just don't last)
Yeah it goes too fast (it ain't coming back)
I don't know where it went (spent it on your friends)
All I know is it gets spent (yeah it just gets spent)
Yeah, the money gets spent
