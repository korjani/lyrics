I got a job on an assembly line.
I used to love them words: "Quttin' time".
I'd hit the door runnin', honey, straight to you,
But now there's nothin' left to go home to.

It's a sad city when the sun goes down.
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round.
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down.
It's a sad city when the sun goes down.
Yeah.

I'm all right by the light of day.
That sunlight seems to keep your mem'ry away.
Everything changes when the shadows fall.
I'm dyin' slowly by the clock on the wall.

'Cause it's a sad city when the sun goes down.
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round.
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down.
It's a sad city when the sun goes down.
Oh Yeah.

[Instrumental Break]
(Ahh.)

It's a sad city when the sun goes down.
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round.
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down.
It's a sad city when the sun goes down.
It's a sad city when the sun goes down.

Sad city when the sun goes down.
Sad city, it's a sad, sad city.
Sad city when the sun goes down.
A sad city.
Sad, sad, sad, sad city.
Sad city when the sun goes down.
Sad city.
