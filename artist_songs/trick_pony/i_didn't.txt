Well they say that opposites attract...
I can see it now as I look back.
You like Kenny G, I love Johnny Cash.
We'd bark an' hiss like dogs and cats.
But the thing that ticked me off the most,
Was how he beat his chest, brag an' boast,
Each time we had a difference of opinion.

Well, he liked the covers pulled down, an' I didn't.
He thought I should lose a few pounds, an' I didn't.
What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
He thought he was God an' I didn't.

Well, it was more than just a lover's spat,
In the civil war of the thermer stack.
He go on an' on like a maniac,
Goin' back an' forth and forth an' back.
I can see him now with his cocky smirk.
Shoulda known right then that it wouldn't work,
Standin' there, pushin' all my buttons.

Well, he liked the toilet seat up an' I didn't.
He thought I should be a C cup an' I didn't.
What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
He thought he was God an' I didn't.

He really thought he was the man,
Who held my world in his hand.
If he ever comes down from that cloud he's sittin' on...
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters, I'll be gone.

[Instrumental Break]

What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
Yeah, he thought he was God,
He really liked himself a lot;
Yeah, he thought he was God an' I didn't.
Uh ha ha, hell, no!

Well, here we are halfway through the Trick Pony record,
An' I am standin' here right now with the legendary George Jones.
Now George, how do you like the record so far?

Well, I ain't even heard the dang thing yet.

Ha, ha, well, there you go folks, he loves it!
