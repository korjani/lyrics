Tonight I'll be drinkin' tequila
And toasting to old Mexico
Listening to Waylon and Willie
And feeding the fire down below
It's only been twenty-four hours
Since my baby walked out on me
If everything's right I will make it tonight
'Cause I've got a sure remedy

From sunup to sundown
I'll paint this one-horse town
I don't give a damn if anyone knows
I'll party on till the heartache is gone
Tonight makes it one in a row

I'm not concerned with tomorrow
It's gonna be more of the same
Dancin' on top of the tables
Till I can't remember her name
Hey bartender break out the bottle
I don't need no salt or no lime
Just keep 'em comin' till my body's numb
She's no longer here on my mind

From sunup to sundown
I'll paint this one-horse town
I don't give a damn if anyone knows
I'll party on till the heartache is gone
Tonight makes it one in a row

From sunup to sundown
I'll paint this one-horse town
I don't give a damn if anyone knows
I'll party on till the heartache is gone
Tonight makes it one in a row

Tonight makes it one in a row
Tonight makes it one in a row
Tequila
