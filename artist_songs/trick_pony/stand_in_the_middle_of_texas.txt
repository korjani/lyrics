The heat rises off of the highway.
My rear-view mirror's a blur.
You had me spinnin' in circles,
Like the dust devils dance in the dirt.
But I fin'lly came to my senses,
It's time I blew out of this place,
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas,
An' tell me you needed some space.

You'd stand in the middle of Texas,
Oh, in the free an' the wide open range,
An' feel like you're hemmed in by fences,
An' lookin' for someone to blame.
Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin',
You're too dead set in your ways.
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas,
An' tell me you needed some space.

Now you can breath just as deep as you want to...
You won't have to smell my perfume.
When you feel the need, you can call me,
Like the lonely wolf howls at the moon.
But this time, I won't come runnin'...
It took me a long time to face,
That you'd stand in the middle of Texas,
An' tell me you needed some space.

You'd stand in the middle of Texas,
In the free an' the wide open range,
An' feel like you're hemmed in by fences,
An' lookin' for someone to blame.
Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin',
Well, you're too dead set in your ways.
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas,
An' tell me you needed some space.

Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin',
Well, you're too damned set in your ways.
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas,
An' tell me you needed some space.
