Lay your body down next to mine
When you take my breath, baby, take your time
There's some things that'll never change
Like you and me and the smell of rain

Feel my lips, baby, on your skin
When the kiss has ended, let's kiss again
There's some things that'll never change
Like you and me and the smell of rain

Oh, yeah

And I, I wanna pour my love on your
Make you feel the way I do
Every moment we're together

I hear you whisper, soft and low
Hold me, baby, and never let go
There's some things that'll never change
Like you and me and the sound of rain

And I, I wanna pour my love on you
Make you feel the way I do
Every moment we're together
And I, I wanna give you everything
Let it shower down like rain
Make the passion last forever

There's some things that'll never change
Like you and me and the smell of rain
Like you and me and the taste of rain
You and me and the sound of rain
Pour my love on you like rain
(Pour my love on you like rain)

Lay your body down next to mine
When you take my breath, baby, take your time
Feel my lips, baby, on your skin
Hear you whisper, soft and low
