I called up the DJ
On Friday after work
I told him how you done me wrong
And how much it hurt
I said, mister I got some things
To get off my chest
I told him what I had in mind
But he turned down my request, he said

You can't say that on the radio
I'd really like to help you out
That's just the way it goes
So sad and that's too bad
Everybody knows
You can't say that on the radio

He told me he understood exactly how I felt
He said, boy I been in your shoes
Once or twice myself
I got a hundred thousand watts
A runnin' through this microphone
And I could let your message ring loud and clear
But tomorrow I'd be gone, because

You can't say that on the radio
I'd really like to help you out
That's just the way it goes
So sad and that's too bad
Everybody knows
You can't say that on the radio

No, you can't say that
You can't say that on the radio
