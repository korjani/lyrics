I like my fun every bit as much as anyone
But I want a love that's real
Somehow you know
How to get inside this heart of gold
Real smooth, real slow
I should turn and leave but
You feel so good to me mercy me

What's a good ole girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

My neck, your lips
You're startin' fires with your fingertips
I can't resist givin' in completely
I can't stop lovin' you lovin' me

What's a good ole girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

Makin' love so sweetly, you feel so good to me
Mercy me, mercy me, mercy me

What's a good ole girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

What's a good ole girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you
