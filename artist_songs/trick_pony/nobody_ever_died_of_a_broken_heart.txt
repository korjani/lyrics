It must've hit you like a hurricane
Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain
Sweet love's gone down the drain
down, down

Girl you're lookin' like a walkin dead
You need to drag a brush across that head
The crack of noon and you're still in bed
Wake up, straighten up, put on your makeup
NO, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart

No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
You cut his head out of every picture
From the letters where he said that he missed ya
All his memories, well you can kiss 'em
Bye, bye

When enough is for sure enough
It's time to shake it out and shake it up
Get in the middle of a great big love
Wham-bam thank you ma'am, baby here we go again

No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
