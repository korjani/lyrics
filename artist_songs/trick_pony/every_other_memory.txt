I thought I had it beat, I thought I was cured
I didn't feel the need for you anymore
I had an iron will so I dropped my guard
Then I found I still had you in my heart
I gave up, I tried my best
It's time to admit I'm powerless, but...

Hey, I'm gonna be fine
Takin' it one step at a time
Prayin' you right off of my mind
If only for today
I may never be free
It's a lifelong recovery
But when I think of you and me
At least I cut it down to every other memory

Once a habit's formed, man, it's hard to quit
I'm countin' on the Lord to help me forget
His tender kiss and the way we touched
I tried to resist but I'm not strong enough
Little by little I'm facing the facts
It's two steps forward and one step back

Hey, I'm gonna be fine
Takin' it one step at a time
Prayin' you right off of my mind
If only for today
I may never be free
It's a lifelong recovery
But when I think of you and me
At least I cut it down to every other memory

Hey, I'm gonna be fine
Takin' it one step at a time
Prayin' you right off of my mind
If only for today
I may never be free
It's a lifelong recovery
But when I think of you and me
At least I cut it down to every other memory

At least I cut it down to every other memory
Every other memory
