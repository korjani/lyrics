Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem're torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem're torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my memory's mind in the wetness of it's soul
Feeling the amber current flowin' from my mind
And war an emply heart you left so cold

Don't let her mem're torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
