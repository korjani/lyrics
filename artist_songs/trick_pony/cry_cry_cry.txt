Well, you'd think that I was happy,
By the smile on my face.
But the second someone speaks your name.

Well, like a baby, I cry, cry, cry, all night long,
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle.
Oh, you oughta be a ashamed,
You left a good man in a bad way.
You left a good man in a bad way.

[Instrumental Break]

The old red Nissan truck,
I guess it ain't so rare,
'Cause since you left me,
Man, I been seein' 'em everywhere.
I called up my DJ;
I made my request.
I said: "Please, please, don't you play that song,
'Cause my baby's gone an' every time that song's on",

"I cry, cry, cry, all night long,
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle."
Oh, you oughta be a ashamed,
You left a good man in a bad way.
You left a good man in a bad way.

[Instrumental Break]

All alone an' walkin' in a daze,
Thinkin' that your heart would never break.
Well, baby, just you wait.

Like a baby, you'll cry, cry, cry, all night long,
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle.
Oh, you oughta be a ashamed,
You left a good man in a bad way.
You left a good man in a bad way.
You left a good man in a bad way.
You left a good man in a bad way.

Hey!

[Instrumental Close]
