Baby there's something wrong
And I can tell that it needs fixin'
It's written all over your face
No one can miss it
You been mopin' around with that hound dog frown
Like your best friend just left ya
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

That ain't nothin' but a lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues
It ain't nothin' but a lowdown sad-song she's-gone attitude
That remedy... a little bit of me for y-o-u
To get you over them
Lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues

So put your arms around me baby
I can make it better
When I get through with you
You'll soon forget her
It ain't no big deal, I know how you feel
I've been right where you're standin'
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

That ain't nothin' but a lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues
It ain't nothin' but a lowdown sad-song she's-gone attitude
That remedy... a little bit of me for y-o-u
To get you over them
Lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues

That ain't nothin' but a lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues
It ain't nothin' but a lowdown sad-song she's-gone attitude
That remedy... a little bit of me for y-o-u
To get you over them
Lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues

To get you over them
Lovesick heart broke hillbilly blues
