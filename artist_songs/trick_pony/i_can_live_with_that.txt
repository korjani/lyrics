Kick it!

He's a jeans an' tee-shirt guy.
Doesn't own a suit an' tie.
He don't impress my Dad...
He ain't all that bad.
He's the kind that's hard to catch,
Lives his life out on the edge.
Yeah, he's a little bit wild,
But he knows how to make me smile.

I can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him.
If I only ever get one chance,
Well, I guess you better count me in.
Say I never make ninety-nine,
Tell me that the world is flat.
Just as long as that man is mine,
Hey, I can live with that.

A little house, a piece of ground;
A two room flat right down town.
Hey, I don;'t care,
I'll go anywhere.
Indianna to LA,
Oklahoma'd be ok.
Wherever he might be,
Hey, that'll work for me.

I can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him.
If I only ever get one chance,
Well, I guess you better count me in.
Say I never make ninety-nine,
Tell me that the world is flat.
Just as long as that man is mine,
Hey, I can live with that.

[Instrumental Break]

He's my destiny, the only love I'll ever need.
You know I'll be satisfied, oh, till the day I die.

I can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him.
If I only ever get one chance,
Well, I guess you better count me in.
Say I never make ninety-nine,
Tell me that the world is flat.
Just as long as that man is mine,
Hey, I can live with that.

[Instrumental Break]
(Oh, oh, yeah.)

(She can live with that;)
(Spend her whole life with him.)
Oh I can live with that.

(She can spoend her life with him.)
Oh, I can live with that.

(She can live with that;)
(Spend her whole life with him.)
