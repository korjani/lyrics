Jesse James was an outlaw man
He was always breakin' the law
Six guns firing from both his hands
Fastest you ever saw
Did he do it for the money
Or was it for the fame
Finally somebody asked him
Jesse, why you wanna rob them trains
And Jessie said

It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the meanest hombre you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do

Well Orville Wright
Set his sights
High up in the air
Him and Wilbur worked day and night
He didn't seem to care
Well the town folk said if you were meant to fly
God would have given you wings
What makes you want to spend all of your time
Building that flying machine
And Orville said

It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the first flight boy you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
Ooh yeah

Well Picasso painted them pictures
There was beauty in every stroke
When asked about his motivation
He said, I think it's about time you should know
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the workinest painter that you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
