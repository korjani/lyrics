She used to play poker, late into the night with old friends.
She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks, but never got drunk.
She stood at that kitchen sink, singin' those great old country songs.
She didn't think anyone was home... man she could really sing.
She laughed loud;
She laughed deep down in her soul.
Her rich blue eyes told us of her heartaches an' pain,
But mostly they shared with us the good times...
The times of peace an' unfiltered happiness.

See traditions run deep around here,
Like the deep red wine grows an' flows all through the valley.
Sometimes, they're all we've got to hold on to.
But now she's gone an' she's never comin' back.
An' I'm here;
I'm here an' not a day goes by that I don't miss Maryann.

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain.
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain.
Oh Lord, take away the pain.

Pull me in, Lord, into your arms;
Hold me tight, hold me tight.
Don't let me go till the morning dawns.
Don't say goodnight, don't say goodnight.

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain.
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain.
Oh Lord, take away the pain.

She said: "Don't be sad I'm leavin' you.
It's all right, it feels all right.
'Cause here He comes, I'll be home soon.
I see the Light, I see the Light."

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain.
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain.
Oh Lord, take away the pain.

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain.
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain.
Oh Lord, take away the pain.
