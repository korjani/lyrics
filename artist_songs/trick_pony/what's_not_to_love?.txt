What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough.
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?

Green eyes, Levis,
Built for speed an' just my size.
Sun tan, oh man...
Makes my heart beat double time.
Well, I know I'm not alone... he's like nobody else,
But I can't help myself.

What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough.
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?

[Instrumental Break]
(Ha, ha.)
(Uh, oh, pick it son.)

Devil's smile, he's kinda wild...
I wanna hold him like a little child.
One look an' I'm hooked.
There's no denyin', he's got style.
He's the dream, he's the king, he's the angel next door.
He's all I could want an' more.

What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough.
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?
Yeah, you tell me... (Yeah, you tell me.)
What's not to love?
Oh, you tell me... (Yeah, you tell me.)
What's not to love?
