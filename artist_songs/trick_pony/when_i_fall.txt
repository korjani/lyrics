When I fall, I fall hard.
Sends shivers through my body, and I lay down my guard.
I'm pure devotion and sweet emotion.
I feel it all when I fall.

When I make love, well, I love strong.
I let go of everything till everything I have is gone.
It's endless passion, it's everlasting.
I feel it all when I fall.

If you don't feel the way I feel,
An' we can still be friends.
But after all that I've been through,
I can't go down that road again.

'Cause when I hurt, well, it runs deep,
An' it's more than just a broken heart or tears down my cheek.
I feel like dying; my soul is crying.
I feel it all when I fall.

[Instrumental Break]
(Oh, when I fall.)

Oh, well I'm pure devotion and sweet emotion.
I feel it all when I fall. (I can feel it all.)
Baby, it's your call when I fall.
Oooh.
