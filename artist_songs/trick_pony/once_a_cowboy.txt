Well, he's been known to lose more than he wins.
He falls down just to get back up again.
The way he smiles... his face is weathered an' leathered an' lined...
You can tell he's learned to laugh through a lotta hard times.
He gets by without shovin'; a drifter and a dreamer.
He gets stoned on a roll your own... what you get is what you see here.

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground.
He wears his freedom like a crown.
Let the whole world around him change,
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.

She tries to tell him he's runnin' out of time,
Oh, but that ain't we you'd see if you were lookin' through his eyes.
He's still chasin' sunsets, still tryin' to find,
Something better than what he'd left behind.
She tries to love him but somehow she understands,
That it was over the moment it began.

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground.
He wears his freedom like a crown.
Let the whole world around him change,
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.

[Instrumental Break]

He's been known to lose more than he wins.
He falls down just to get back up again.

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground.
He wears his freedom like a crown.
Let the whole world around him change,
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy.
yeah,
Let the whole world around him change,
Oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, oh.
