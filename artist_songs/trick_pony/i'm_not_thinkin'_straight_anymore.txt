I've taken down all of your pictures
Put neon up on the wall
Hung pool-table lights from the fixtures
And I built me a bar down the hall

I hired me a man, he comes in at six
He stays 'til I turn out the lights
He's there with a drink when I need a fix
To help you get off of my mind

I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
Not since you walked out that door
I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool
Watchin' that bartender pour
I'm not thinkin' straight anymore

Now everyone's got their opinion
Most people think I'm just gone
They question my new way of thinkin'
They ask me what planet I'm on

When I cross that long bridge that goes into town
That water reminds me of wine
The buildings, they all look like bottles
And it takes me right back in time

I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
Not since you walked out that door
I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool
Watchin' that bartender pour
I'm not thinkin' straight anymore

There's no use pretending
I need something mind-bending
To help me get over you

I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
Not since you walked out that door
I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool
Watchin' that bartender pour
I'm not thinkin' straight anymore

I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
Not since you walked out that door
I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool
Watchin' that bartender pour
I'm not thinkin' straight anymore

I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
