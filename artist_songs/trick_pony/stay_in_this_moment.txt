Before you must leave
This evening, this hour
And the rush of this moment is through
I want to tell you
How good it felt to
Completely surrender to you
Feeling you close
Right here besides me
Almost suspended in time
I don't want to move
I don't want to let go
I don't want to leave this behind

Honey, stay in my arms
Stay in this cradle
And rock me to sleep
Tell me you're able
To make time stand still
And there's nowhere you've got to be

Stay in this moment with me
The wind through the window
The words that we whisper
A touch only true love can claim
As long as the moonlight chases the shadows
There's nothing that I want to change

Honey, stay in my arms
Stay in this cradle
And rock me to sleep
Tell me you're able
To make time stand still
And there's nowhere you've got to be

Honey, stay in my arms
Stay in this cradle
And rock me to sleep
Tell me you're able
To make time stand still
And there's nowhere you've got to be
