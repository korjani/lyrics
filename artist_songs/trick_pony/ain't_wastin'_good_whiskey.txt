Well, it's Friday night at the Farmer's Daughter.
But I'm the only one here drinkin' Barley water.
You left me to drown my broken heart.
But this one, I'll get over, well, stone cold sober.

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok.
"Jack Daniels" or "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through.
You wasted my time, my heart and my mind too...
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you.
Ha, ha.

An' I'll admit, we've lived some on the wild side.
We dug our heels in deep an' had a wild ride.
Oh but one good shot of you was all I needed,
So don't set 'em up, Joe, oh no, I'll stick to H2O.

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok.
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through.
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too... (My time.)
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you.
Ah ha.

[Instrumental Break]
(Oh, I think we need a little help from our friends.)

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok.
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through.
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too...
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you.
No I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you.
Yee hah.
