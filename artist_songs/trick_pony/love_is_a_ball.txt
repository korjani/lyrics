Love is a ball, a hundred-pound ball
On the end of a chain about ten foot long
Wrapped around my ankle, I drag it down the hall
People let me tell ya that love is a ball
(Kick it in)

Love is a Chevy, a '67 Chevy
Sittin' in the back seat, breathin' hot and heavy
Foggin' upt he window 'til I can't see out at all
People let me tell ya that love is a ball

There are so many variations
Sometimes it all can come unwound...wound...wound
But given any situation
You will find it always hangin' 'round...round...round

Love is a child, an innocent child
Runnin' through a field full of flowers growin' wild
Laughin' and jumpin', rollin' when they fall
People let me tell ya that love is a ball

Love is a ball, a hundred-pound ball
On the end of a chain about ten foot long
Love is a Chevy, A '67 Chevy
Sittin' in the back seat, breathin' hot and heavy
Love is a child, an innocent child
Runnin' through a field full of flowers growin' wild
We live on a rock, it holds us one and all
All we want is love and love is a ball
