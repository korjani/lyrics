Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota)
And it tore me up ev'ry time I heard her drawl, Southern Drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river)
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Well I pulled into Natchez next day down the river
But there wasn't that much to make a rounder stay very long
But when I left it was rainin' so nobody saw me cry
Big River why you doin' me this way

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, Roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me
