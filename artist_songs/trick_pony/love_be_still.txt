Lyin' here tonight with you here by my side
God I wish that this could last forever
But the plain and honest truth
Is I can't get inough of you"And I am not complete 'til we're together

Stay right here
Just relax
Lets get lost
Just lay back
And let it all slip away
Slowly watch
The night roll into day
Let two hearts in love"Go where they will
Time may fly but love be still

These are busy times, things are movin' fast
So hold me now and kiss me soft and tender
Well I could not ask for more
Just lock the world outside our door
As our bodies become one and we surrender

Stay right here
Just relax
Lets get lost
Just lay back
And let it all slip away
Slowly watch
The night roll into day
Let two hearts in love"Go where they will
Time may fly but love be still

The clock up on the wall keeps tickin'
And it always will
But here with you we have the power
To let our love be still

Stay right here
Just relax
Lets get lost
Just lay back
And let it all slip away
Slowly watch
The night roll into day
Let two hearts in love"Go where they will
Time may fly but love be still
