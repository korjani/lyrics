One two three, c'mon.

I got to say there's something on my mind.
I've liked the way you been for a long, long time.
You've got your mind set up on what you're gonna do. (What you're gonna do.)
Your Mamma didn't make no fool.

You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey, hey.

Listen up now...
My Mamma warned me 'bout a girl like you.
She said: " A girl like that's gonna break your heart in two."
"With sexy legs an' hair, ... an ordinary one."
Stop right there, Mamma, 'cause you know that's what I want.

You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey, hey.

[Instrumental Break]

You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're my little Senorita,
You got it going on.
Hey, hey.
My little Senorita,
You got it going on.

Now George, I got one more question for you.
What do you think about country music today?

Oh, ho, ho, ha, ha.

C'mon, give it to me!

I love Trick Pony.

All right, that's what I wanna hear.
