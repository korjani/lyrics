I'll face my fear of the evening once I get used to this feeling.
I can't sleep,
That's when you're torn away from me.
While I'm dreaming I feel you leaving.

I'll face my fear of the sunrise when I wake up with your hand inside mine.
It's hard to say "good morning" when it's followed with "goodbye".
Just wanted to say "good night".

Our eyes fighting the light,
But I'm not ready to say "good night".
I try and hold on tight cause it's just not time to say "good night".
Say good night.

I'll face my fear of the cold nights when you leave me behind.
I felt your hands in my hair,
I felt your breath on my neck,
Yeah, I need to feel you again.

Just wanted to say "good night".

Our eyes fighting the light,
But I'm not ready to say "good night".
I try and hold on tight cause it's just not time to say "good night".
Say good night.

These eyes are closed again for yet another night.
I wake up and I can feel you by my side,
but I can't find you in the dark when you're so far.
Yeah that's the hardest part.
Here comes the hardest part.

Our eyes fighting the light,
But I'm not ready to say "good night".
I try and hold on tight cause it's just not time to say "good night".
Say good night.

"I mean. In what world do I go to sleep after you and wake up before you?! I don’t even know how it happens. Well I hope you’re having sweet dreams, and you call me when you wake up."
