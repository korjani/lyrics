I feel you in these walls 
You're a cold air creeping in 
Chill me to my bones and skin 
I heard you down the hall 
But it's vacant when I'm looking in 
Oh, who let you in? 
You walk around like you own the place
But you never say anything 
I caught you walking straight through my walls 
Guess it was all my fault 
I think I let you in 

Never thought that I would feel like this 
Such a mess when I'm in your presence, I’ve 
Had enough, think you've been making me sick 
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah 
It's my house 
And I think it's time to get out 
It's my soul
It isn't yours anymore 
It's my house 
I think it's time to get out 
Yeah, I think it's time to get out 

You're at my bedroom door 
Heard your footsteps on the floor 
Closer than ever before 
And now you're in my room 
You're a cold air creeping through 
Under sheets avoiding you 
You walk around I can hear you pace 
Circling my bed frame 
Oh, but now we're face to face 
Head on my pillowcase 
But darling, you can't stay 

Never thought that I would feel like this 
Such a mess when I'm in your presence, I’ve 
Had enough, think you've been making me sick 
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah 
It's my house 
And I think it's time to get out 
It's my soul
It isn't yours anymore 
It's my house 
And I think it's time to get out 
Yeah, I think it's time to get out

Haven't you heard? 
I'm not yours anymore 
I'm not yours anymore 

It's my soul 
(And I think it's time to get out) 
Haven't you heard? 
I'm not yours anymore 
I'm not yours anymore 

It's my house 

(I feel you in these walls 
You're a cold air creeping in 
Chill me to my bones and skin)

Never thought that I would feel like this 
Such a mess when I'm in your presence, I’ve 
Had enough, think you've been making me sick 

It's my house 
And I think it's time to get out 
It's my soul
It isn't yours anymore 
It's my house 
I think it's time to get out 
Yeah, I think it's time to get out
