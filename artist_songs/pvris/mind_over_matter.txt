You were spoiled rotten and turned stale like all your plans
My tongue's acquired tolerance for tastes I couldn't stand
You've been stuck in a rut and a wasteland, drowned in swamps below your feet

So just trust me, you'll be just fine
I need your trust just for tonight
This is not a place in my head
Reach out your hands and tell me just what you feel
This is not just all in your head
Mind over matter makes these things feel so real

I can see the doubt in your eyes
You say there's no such thing as better things in life
Well, I must confess this is all too new for me
A whole new world, a whole new world to see

Trust me, you'll be just fine
I need your trust just for tonight
This is not a place in my head
Reach out your hands and tell me just what you feel
This is not just all in your head
Mind over matter makes these things feel so real

Keep an open mind, it brings open hearts and open eyes.
You walk around with your hands out, and I've never seen anyone so blind

This is not a place in my head
Reach out your hands and tell me just what you feel
This is not just all in your head
Mind over matter makes these things feel so real

This is not a place in my head
Reach out your hands and tell me just what you feel
This is not just all in your head
Mind over matter makes these things feel so real
