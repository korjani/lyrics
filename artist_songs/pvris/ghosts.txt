I'm the one with the ghosts in my bed,
But they only come alive at night.
Stuck in my sheets an accustomed coffin,
I swear that I'll be fine,
I'll be fine in the daylight.
If I change, I start to fade,
And all the green in my eyes desaturate,
It's my head not my heart that's strayed.
I'm sorry I keep pushing you away.

You're the one at the foot of my bed trying to keep me alive at night.
Using words as a comforter you said, "I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight."
But they, they sink into my skin,
Pushing you out just to make their way in.
I've grown sick of this fight so frequent.
If you can't help it then I'll push you away.

Why can't you stay?
I'm up against these things I can't see.
They don't compare.
Make me believe, make me believe. 

Why can't you stay?
I'm up against these things I can't see.
They don't compare.
Make me believe, make me believe

Make me believe, make me believe

I'm sorry I keep pushing. (yeah)
I'm sorry I keep pushing.
I'm sorry I keep pushing.
Now you're up against the ghosts in my head (my head)
I'm sorry I keep pushing.
Now you're up against the ghosts in my head (my head)

Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Hey hey 
Oh 

Why can't you stay?
I'm up against these things I can't see.
They don't compare.
Make me believe, make me believe. 

Why can't you stay?
I'm up against these things I can't see.
They don't compare. (why can't you stay) 

Make me believe, make me believe 
Make me believe, make me believe
