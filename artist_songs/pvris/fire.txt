Don't blame your death 
On the shit in your head that you claimed ate you like a virus for days on end.
I watched you decay,
Watched you waste away.
Who'd you think you'd fool, baby, digging your own grave?

So go ahead, you just drop dead,
And while you're trying to fool the whole world don't forget that you'll decay
And you'll waste away.
You can't cheat death when you're digging your own grave.

You're out of line,
Buried yourself alive,
And expected to be fine.
You can't rewind,
When you're choking on your own dirt,
Begging for your life.

Your bridges are burning. (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning. (All your tables are turning)
You started a fire and you're,
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up (Hey, hey!) 
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.

What you give is what you get.
And in your case that's nothing but guilt and regret.
And all the flames you kept in your brain,
Came out your lips and sent you straight into your own grave.

You were a walking, talking, corpse at best.
And I swear I couldn't wait to get you off my chest,
And when you asked us why
We couldn't look you in your eyes,
It's hard to find life,
In something that's already died.

You're out of line,
Buried yourself alive
And expected to be fine.
You can't rewind,
When you're choking on your own dirt begging for your life.

Your bridges are burning. (All of your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning. (All your tables are turning) 
You started a fire and you're, 
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up (Hey, hey!) 
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.

You started a fire. 

You're out of line,
Buried yourself alive,
And expected to be fine.
You can't rewind.
When you're choking on your dirt,
Begging for your life.

Your bridges are burning. (All your bridges are burning) 
And all the tables are turning. (All your tables are turning) 
You started a fire, 
And you're,
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up (Hey, hey!) 
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
Burning up, up.
Burning up.
