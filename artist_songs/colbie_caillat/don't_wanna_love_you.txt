There's burning in your eyes
Craving I can't hide
That's raging through the heart of me
Just like a wild fire
I wanna touch the sparks
But I'm safer in the dark
I'm scared to see what happens
If we let it go too far

I don't wanna miss you
I don't wanna wish you
Always fall around every time I'm without you
I don't wanna see you inside every dream
You're never gonna make come true
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna love you
But I do

Is the pleasure worth the pain?
The sunlight worth the rain?
The silence worth the sound of our hearts
Screaming while they break
Is surrender worth the fight?
When the battle leaves you blind?
And if you never see me
Will I still be on your mind?

I don't wanna miss you
I don't wanna wish you
Always fall around every time I'm without you
I don't wanna see you inside every dream
You're never gonna make come true
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna love you
But I do
But I do

No, I don't wanna miss you
I don't wanna wish you
Always fall around every time I'm without you
I don't wanna see you inside every dream
You're never gonna make come true
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna love you
But I do
But I do
