Come with me, I'll take you far away
Come with me, I'll take you far away

I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart

Come with me
Co-om-me with me

I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart

I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart
I'm a gypsy heart

It's a sunny day, on the golden coast
I'm a dream away, and I'm good to go
Got a zepplin' groove, on the stereo
And the song that is on, is the sound of my soul

I'm a gypsy heart, we were backed upon
Anywhere we are, is where we belong
But you're far away, and it's been too long
So I go where I'm going, I never know
But

I can't wait, to get back out on the road
Counting every mile, 'til I get where I'm going
I don't even care, if it's fast or it's slow
As long as it's taking me to ya

I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
As long as it's takin' me to, ya

So I take a breath, and I close my eyes
Now I see your face, and I start to smile
I'm a singing bird, in an open sky
So I fly and I fly, 'til I get real high
Oh

I can't wait to get back out on the road
Counting every mile, 'til I get where I'm going
I don't even care, if it's fast or it's slow
As long as it's taking me to ya

I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart

As long as it's takin' me to ya

If I'm in your arms, I can dream all day
If there's clouds in the sky, we can wish them away
'cause I need you right now, and I don't wanna wait
So I walk 'til I run, and I run 'til I fly
'cause

I can't wait to get back out on the road
I'm counting every mile, 'til I get where I'm going
I don't even care, if it's fast or it's slow
As long as it's taking me to ya

Oh I can't wait to get back, out on the road
I'm counting every mile, 'til I get where I'm going
I don't even care, if it's fast or it's slow
As long as it's taking me to ya

I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart

As long as it's taking me to ya
As long as it's taking me to ya
As long as it's taking me to ya
