There's so much that I never knew, but I'm still learning
Always planning dream after dream and wanting more things
All the best things in life are free
We'll be happy wherever we'll be
So how about right now?

Let's stay up from dusk 'til dawn
Lay until we see the sun
Curl up inside your arms; right here's where we belong
We're the lucky ones, living life forever young
Get lost in making love; let's love
Like tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes
Let's stay forever young, yeah

Windmills turning, our hearts are burning
Red like sunrise
Kisses on a hot summer morning
Live the good life
Who knew the good life could taste so sweet?
I've got all that I'll ever need
Right here, right now

Let's stay up from dusk 'til dawn
Lay until we see the sun
Curl up inside your arms; right here's where we belong
We're the lucky ones, living life forever young
Get lost in making love; let's love
Like tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes
Let's stay forever young, yeah

And if you haven't found love, know that you will find it
It might take a while; you could be right beside him
Don't know what the tide brings, but that could be a good thing
But what if this is the night?

Let's stay up from dusk 'til dawn
Lay until we see the sun
Curl up inside your arms; right here's where we belong
We're the lucky ones, living life forever young
Get lost in making love; let's love
Like tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes
Let's stay forever young, yeah
Like tomorrow never comes
