If I open the door to my homeless heart
Would you stay for a night?
Or maybe 10,000 more in a row or the rest of your life?
If I plant you a field of every flower I know
Would you help them to grow?
Would you be like the sunshine after the rain or the bitter cold?

Oh, baby, say you'll stay
'Cause I ain't got anymore love left to waste
If you stay, maybe you could be the one that never got away

Would you open your world like a window to me?
I've been missing the view
I've been careless before, so be careful with me
I've got too much to lose

Oh, baby, say you'll stay
'Cause I ain't got anymore love left to waste
If you stay, maybe you could be the one that never got away

I need your love like the desert needs water
Thunder and lightning and white hurricanes

Say you'll stay 'cause I ain't got anymore love left to waste
If you stay, maybe you could be the one that never got away
