Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Cause every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way it couldn't be
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

Ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' Alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Well boy you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
That when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time I must keep dry 
Got to stop believin' in all your lies
Cause there's too much to do before I die

Ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Don't get too lost in all I say
Like the time I really felt that way
But that was then and now it's today
Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
Till' someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name, yes, and a different face

Ya Feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
