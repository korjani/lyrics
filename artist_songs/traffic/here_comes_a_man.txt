I've heard it said people's souls chase the night
Hoping for times that went before when their hearts were flying
No, don't you be blue when you hear the wild birds call
Oh, hold on, love, 'cause I'll never let you fall
Here comes a man who'll give you all the love he can
Far from the rain where you'll never feel the pain
Don't cry, we'll come alive, oh, if you'll wait for me
Out of my head a vision flows bathed in light
Borne by the tide along the shore where the wind is sighing
No, don't you be blue when you hear the music play
Just hold on, love, 'cause we're gonna sail away
[refrain]
I've been coming to set you free 'cause your love belongs to me
Yes, I'm going to make you mine 'till the end of time
Hoping to get through and that the hailstones don't fall
So hold on, love, like you never did before
[refrain]
