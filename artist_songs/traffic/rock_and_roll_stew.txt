Sitting in a transit all night long
Playing clubs and rocking right on
The road's much too long since I've been wasting my time
Wish I was home again sipping my wine

And I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone
I don't care, it's where I'm from
I'm on the road again

LA to London is a mighty long time
Eight hours flying can bring you down
Sitting near a suit who's a red-neck going,
Eyes are moving but there's no life showing

And I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone
I don't care, it's where I'm from
I'm on the road again

Now that I'm home again, things are much better
Biding my time with my little go-getter
No matter what they say, no matter what they do,
Gonna end up in the middle of that rock and roll stew
Gone, gone, gone...
