Withering tree, bearing no fruit
Never will see an evergreen suit
Reaching right out, out for the sun
Broken old branches, fall one by one
Into the arms of eternity

Fighting the fish up from the deep
Oh how I wish the lake would not sleep
Following dreams into the blue
There you will see, hidden from view
Trees in the arms of eternity
Into the arms of eternity
