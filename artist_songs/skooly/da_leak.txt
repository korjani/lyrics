It's a lot of niggas on that fuck shit
That's why I'm wid some niggas I grew up with
It's a lot of niggas on that fuck shit

It's a lot of niggas on that fuck shit
That's why I'm wid some niggas I grew up with
Heard them pussy niggas on that none sense
We pull up on niggas with them dumb sticks
We are not the ones for you to fuck with
We gone have them youngins on that dumb shit
Cause I got dough in this bitch
Yea we got dough in this bitch
We'll go to war in this bitch
We'll go to war in this bitch
I got my boys in this bitch
I got my boys in this bitch
Look at my boys in this bitch
Look at my boys in this bitch
They screaming damn, soon as I got my side
Come with the fam, niggas who got my back
Niggas who got my back
I'm with the same old niggas, I cannot lie bout that
Who you gone try bout that
You just might die bout that
I go outside bout that
I go upside your head
I'm in a war by my title
My grandmama was a fighter
Hop in the club with my idol
Don't mean to fucking excite you
This shit is fucking enticing
I'm going in with no license
I got ya bitch and she like it
Told her to lick and don't bite it
Told her to lick and don't bite it
Jump on that dick and she ride it
I got a head full of dreams
I got a fist full of rings
Told them I'm deep in the streets
But nobody listen to me
Now they be dragging my swag
Now they be dissing a g

My brother died in the trap house, I watched him whip up a ki
Swagger be dripping on me
I roll a stiff for the weed
I been with 10 in the streets
We in a sprinter no jeep
I'm with the set when I creep
My diamond wet like a leaf

I know you getting from me
I know you getting from me
I know you getting from me
I know you getting from me
