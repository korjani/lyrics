I heard the young nigga plotting
I heard the young nigga looking
Giuseppe, I'm steady just walking
Young nigga feel like a rookie
So many bands on me, young nigga need a prescription
Blue bezel deep off in my watch
Young nigga feel like a Piston
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems

Young nigga never had money
The dealer lived up the all' from me
I always wanted that fast money
Plus my little partner dem get scam money
Hey, we gives a fuck bout no nigga, fuck bout no nigga
We might pull up on a nigga, up on a nigga
I got the ups on a nigga, ups on a nigga
Flex on 'em, drop all the bucks on them niggas, fuck em
Yay, when I'm in the building
I come to hurt niggas feelings, shit
I'm another nigga, used to do dirt when I was little
Around all that work when I was little
I never worked when I was little
Come from the bottom
I spotted them at the top, I got em
The top looking wobbly, I'm thinking 'bout dropping it
I got 98 problems, getting rich ain't one, a bitch ain't one
Hold up bitch I ain't done

I heard the young nigga plotting
I heard the young nigga looking
Giuseppe, I'm steady just walking
Young nigga feel like a rookie
So many bands on me, young nigga need a prescription
Blue bezel deep off in my watch
Young nigga feel like a Piston
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems
I got rich problems

Bitch I got a whole lot of money
The niggas you with, they do a whole lot of fronting
I fucked up a check like fuck this shit I'm up little bitch
And we don't give a fuck lil bitch, it's 400 a cup lil bitch
I'm in Oakland, hundreds point, I'm probably fucking round with Tuck and shit
Never move alone I probably got the nine all tucked and shit
Diamonds and my jewels, strapped whenever I move
If I don't do what I do, then the trap ain't never gone move
Ability to be the greatest, hanging around all the majors
Since I was young I had big dreams, gave mama a spot, I was 16
Been had the money, been had the swag, been had the cash
I gave these niggas the swag, but I didn't give 'em my last, damn!
Young nigga feel like a rookie, prescription!

I heard the young nigga plotting
