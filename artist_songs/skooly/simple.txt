Life is as you know
I could have known
I should have known, fuck it
I should have told him
Ice full of cold feet
Nights full of cold feet
These niggas get nosey
Got me a nosebleed
This how it goes, I see
It's just how it goes you see
Fuck it, somebody should have came and told me
That most of these rappers will gonna be pussy
Don't like to douche
You cussing yo potna out over some pussy
Nigga you pussy
West Side, nigga
Yes, my nigga
That Side, nigga
That's my nigga
Thought I forgot
Oh You thought I forgot
I know who sent them niggas
You ain't sent them niggas
Shoot up the spot
Shoot up ya spot
Pull up on sight
Shoot them on spot
Not tryin to be gangsta
I come from the block
So I might be gangsta, whether you like or not
(Nigga he crip) I'm in the back of the Maybach
And my mans say leave it alone
But them niggas did some shit
That you cannot take back
I'm just praying they leave it alone
I got some killers behind me
The niggas are really behind me
I'm from a killing environment
(Come from a killin enviorment)
But this is a different time
I'm in a different designer
For them niggas that think they my rivals
This is a silly reminder
You'll never step to me nigga
I got the recipe, nigga
I taught the best of these niggas
Who taught the rest of these niggas
Be in this shit till' I'm elderly nigga
You smellin me nigga
And I made it all the way to 21 without a felony, nigga
That new chopper my legacy nigga!

I knew when I jumped in this shit
Niggas wouldn't be the same
I would never change
I won't change
For no petty change
Pussy niggas play
I won't play
I'm a spread his brains
I do this for J
And Ye
Ain't no Roc with me
