Quan pulled me up, it's a suicide
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
That Draco got 30, it's do or die
I pull up and murder, it's do or die
We never heard of you, do or die
Yike, yike, yike
What's in my cup is a suicide

[Skooly & Rich Homie Quan:]
What's in my cup is a suicide
Drinking on dirty, I'm starting [?]
What's in your cup is a suicide
.40 on my waist, you don't want me to use it
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
I'm talking about a 83333
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
Click, clack, bang, click, clack, bang, nigga

Doors opened up, yeah suicide
Riding round listening to do or die
Me and Skooly got a game on our 'jects
Like some brand new boots with the shoes tied
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in your cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
Percocets on me, it's do or die
Perky, perky, perky, perk

[Skooly:]
Yeah King Cosa, Gotti

Don't throw up no newer signs
Okay, you niggas hide all your daughters
I'm in that bitch with Quan
Chopper we got weigh a ton
Don't give a fuck bout your son
Don't give a fuck bout your son
You ever seen a real crip with a blood?
You ever seen me fiending for the drugs?
You never seen me fiending for the drugs
You never seen me fiending for the mud
They was telling me they showing me love
They was holding me, they knew what it was
They was showing me I know where the broads
You get shot nigga just like a mug
And my brother still behind the wall
And he's still on that bullshit
Used to have me on that bullshit
Took the car, made him get out and walk
I went back and forth into it with the law
Caught the nigga coming out of the mall
Wasn't winning did some time for y'all
I was really, really down for y'all
