Never change yourself 100 percent
Like like like niggas change everyday B
Like not even on no funny shit like Niggas change everyday
Like never change for no change
And never change yourself 100 percent
Change those bad things that you dun did
Or change them bad ways that you have
But never change yourself 100 percent
You need to be you til the day you die
You digg what I'm saying
Never change and try to be like nobody ya digg
You know you got a mouth that shit for eating that shit not for biting ya digg
King Cosa I'm Out
