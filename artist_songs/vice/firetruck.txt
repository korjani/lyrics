[TK Kravits:]
She's burning up the floor, I can't take it no more
I got to hold her down, down
Firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck

One thing on my mind, goddamn, she's fine
I just want her body all over mine
Let me see you, let me see you wine
Let me see you, let me see you wine
Oh man, goddamn, you on fire
I'll put that thing to your flame, get you higher
Got you flying higher than a bird
But I'm a put it down, that's my word
We can keep it on the low, nobody gotta know
We can keep it on the low, nobody gotta know
We can keep it on the low, nobody gotta know
We can keep it on the low, nobody gotta know

She's burning up the floor, I can't take it no more
I got to hold her down, down
Firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck

[Sage the Gemini:]
Vroom vroom vroom, we pull up in Lamborghinis
At the pool party, they losing all their bikinis
They tryna give me hugs as soon as I walk in
She like, "That's a cucumber or are you happy to see me?"
I'm like hahaha yeah (I'm thirsty), excuse me (I'm tryna get by)
Into the VIP with my people
They gon' pop bottles without me, though
I don't drink, but I throw money like a free throw
I'm getting numbers, but I don't text 'em
Makin' niggas feel crazy like a [?]
You done got me on your phone saved under "Bestie"
Need a deal with Muscle Milk, how I'm here flexing

[TK Kravits:]
She's burning up the floor, I can't take it no more
I got to hold her down, down
Firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck

You been so hot, baby
Love me 'til I'm [?]
Those curves got me so delusional
Goddamn, you hot, baby, if you ain't know

She's burning up the floor, I can't take it no more
I got to hold her down, down
Firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck
Holds it down, holds it down, holds it down, firetruck
