[Vice:]
FNF, TMI, Vice

Flip a whole pound a Molly, kick a whole brick of white
Boy trappin' all night
Stop actin' like you body, you ain't really 'bout that gunplay
Boy, blast you on sight
Gimme some drugs and some more ammunition
To oppose all of my foes
TMI Gang, bitch, I'm ridin' with Stitches
We ain't playin' with these hoes

Flip a whole pound a Molly, kick a whole brick of white
Boy trappin' all night
Stop actin' like you body, you ain't really 'bout that gunplay
Boy, blast you on sight
Gimme some drugs and some more ammunition
To oppose all of my foes
TMI Gang, bitch, I'm ridin' with Stitches
We ain't playin' with these hoes

Too much ink on my body, flexin' and finessin' all these hoes
Catch you slippin' at the red light, aim it at you that's that red light
Livin' life like a movie, if we talkin' 'bout blow
Ask the lord to forgive me, hear the devil knockin' at my front door
It's the evil that's in me, we talkin' murder then I want more
Claim we Illuminati, but you know I can't tell you
Hello officer, I have nothin' to tell you
Your bottoms all laced up, leavin' blow at my footsteps
Tell my shooters go and load up, leave a mess when I can't spit
Call the coroner to pick it up, you know we keep 'em on the payroll
Let them dispose of the evidence, that's how you get a case closed
I smell a pig from a mile away, you couldn't fool me with the plain clothes

Flip a whole pound a Molly, kick a whole brick of white
Boy trappin' all night
Stop actin' like you body, you ain't really 'bout that gunplay
Boy, blast you on sight
Gimme some drugs and some more ammunition
To oppose all of my foes
TMI Gang, bitch, I'm ridin' with Stitches
We ain't playin' with these hoes

Flip a whole pound a Molly, kick a whole brick of white

[Stitches:]
Fuck you and your squad, TMI Gang 'til I die
Everybody know who I am, I'm screamin' out fuck a nine to five
Loyalty and respect, I demand it, if your booty is fat, I'm gon' grab it
I'm geeked off of Molly, I'm geeked off of Molly
Got your girl crushin' my body, she sucked the babies out my body
I love a bitch to be body
