FNF, squad, squad, squad, squad

Even though y'all doubt me, I'm still gon' make it
Talk shit about me, I'm still gon' make it
Even though y'all hate me, I'm still gon' make it
Y'all can never out me, I'm still gon' make it

But I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
Talk if you wanna, you still gon' have to pay me
I'm a lil psycho, but that's the shit that makes me

I'm a lil skitzo, that's how my mama made me
You a lil bitch, that's how yo mama made you
Jump off that [?], you never been on the avenue
If it's about my revenue then hell yeah I got an attitude
Don't play with my money, this ain't a fuckin' game
I got Playboy bunnies, [?]
I know y'all hate me, but see me clearer than HD
Forget the radio, bitch, I'm goin' viral
Don't walk in a straight line, spin around in spirals
[?] flows, I burn you up like Spyro
[?] moving the crowd
Infecting your eardrums you can't turn it down
Injecting these verbs and these nouns
How you gon' hate my sound?
I'm kuh-razy, courageous, my flows is outrageous
You rappers outdated, my bitches be crazy
But never be lazy, everybody gon' get paid
Y'all better fall back or everybody gon' get sprayed
Let's throw a fuckin' party, everybody gon' get laid

Even though y'all doubt me, I'm still gon' make it
Talk shit about me, I'm still gon' make it
Even though y'all hate me, I'm still gon' make it
Y'all can never out me, I'm still gon' make it

But I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
Talk if you wanna, you still gon' have to pay me
I'm a lil psycho, but that's the shit that makes me

A couple loose screws, I'm messed up in the head
I grew up a screw-up, now these girls wanna screw us
Reporters interview us, these groupies wanna do us
Y'all playin' in the little leagues, what we do is major
Creep in the dark, I'm a spot you with this laser
Flows is shocking like a taser, I be stuntin' on you haters
I be ballin' like a peso, goin' up like elevators
Don't got time for these bitches, only for the paper
You don't understand me? Don't make me have to scream at you
Married to the money, that's why I have to scream, I do
I'm a lil coo-coo
I been talkin' to myself, fuck everybody else

Even though y'all doubt me, I'm still gon' make it
Talk shit about me, I'm still gon' make it
Even though y'all hate me, I'm still gon' make it
Y'all can never out me, I'm still gon' make it

But I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
I don't care, cause I'm kuh-razy
Talk if you wanna, you still gon' have to pay me
I'm a lil psycho, but that's the shit that makes me
