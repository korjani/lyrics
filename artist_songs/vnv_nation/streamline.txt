Build me a future,
Splendid and graceful.
Make it better by design.
Perfected strategies, applied technologies. 
A brighter future for a darker age.

Before me a vision, forged with great intentions.
Of generations yet to come.
Aerodynamic dreams, across the stratosphere.
Foundations for tomorrows, way of life today.

Write a new world symphony, for the 21st century.
The dawning of the age to come.
Streamline simplicity, the renaissance of humanity.
Avenues of light to guide us home.

Discard the old regimes, failed ideologies.
Draw the lines and start again.
Build towers that pierce the sky, the figurehead of individual minds.
horizons unlimited, and unified.
potential overdrive, free thought and open minds, as if beams of photons lit the night.
Electronic alchemists, in the new metropolis, enlightened living through practicality.

Write a new world symphony, for the 21st century.
The dawning of the age to come.
Streamline simplicity, the renaissance of humanity.
Avenues of light to guide us home.
