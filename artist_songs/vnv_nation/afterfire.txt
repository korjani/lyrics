We have been waiting for you, anticipating you
We shall not lose faith in all that is heaven
And heaven is such a small place

Seconds to minutes to hours to days
Screaming for something that's something I will never hold
All around you is tinder for the Gods

Seconds to minutes to hours to days
Screaming for something that's something I will never hold
All around you is tinder for the Gods
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire

All around you is tinder for the Gods
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire

All around you is tinder for the Gods
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire
