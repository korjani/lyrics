Put your hand into my hand
Put your head against my head
Put your lips against my lips
Put self consciousness aside

No redemption
No confessions
No distractions
No possessions
Let your blood run through my veins
Blade shall numb you from the pain

No tomorrows
Just submittance
No remorse of self indulgence
Just your body
Just your body
Just your body
Just your body
Just your body on my body
Want your thoughts of me inside
Let your hands run on my skin

Let me be the one you need
I shall be the one you feed
All I am and all you see
Is all I will and ever be

Invigoration
Angulation
Mortal acts of indignation

Put your lips against my lips
Put self consciousness aside

Invigoration
Angulation
Mortal acts of indignation

Put your lips against my lips
Put self consciousness aside

Invigoration
Angulation
Mortal acts of indignation

Crave it all
Know no other
Crash your dreams and fall forever
Show me no place you hide behind
Only body soul entwined
Let me be the one you need
I shall be the one you feed
All I am and all you feel
All that will and ever be

Invigoration
Angulation
Mortal acts of indignation

Just your body on my body
Want your thoughts of me inside

No redemption
No confessions
No distractions
Or possessions
No tomorrows
Just submittance
No remorse of self indulgence

Invigoration
Angulation
Mortal acts of indignation
