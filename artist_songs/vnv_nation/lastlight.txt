Forget your fears, and want no more
Forget your fears, and want no more

At first light lay proud foundations
Sense the greatness that before you unfolds
Seek no more for hollow answers
Answers that lay within you all along
Farewell to dawns seen through saddened eyes
Farewell to pasts, to sorrows chained
Forget your fears and want no more
You will be strong and want no more
You'll be adored, you will have everything
You will be strong and want no more
Forget your fears, you will have everything
And want no more
