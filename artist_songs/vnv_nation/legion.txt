Enveloped in a sentiment
A sound that rushes over me
Engage an impulse to pretend
I have a faith that's pure

Not forgetting what it means to dream
Indulging everything
Entertaining thoughts that I've the strength
Of those I am to be
Cheers and tribute greet your saviours
Reckless thoughts survive
Anachronistic and impulsive

And what will happen?
Will I dream?
I am too scared to close my eyes
For a second, please hold me
None can change in me these things that I believe
But I don't know what happens now
I am too scared to close my eyes

And what will happen?
Will I dream?
I am too scared to close my eyes
For a second, please hold me
None can change in me these things that I believe
But I don't know what happens now
I am too scared to close my eyes
