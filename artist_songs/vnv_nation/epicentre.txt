I asked myself was I content,
with the world that I once cherished?
Did it bring me to this darkened place
to contemplate my perfect future?
I will not stand nor utter words against this tide of hate.
Losing sight of what and who I was again

I'm so sorry if these seething words I say 
Impress on you 
That I've become the anathema of my soul

I can't say that you're losing me
I always tried to keep myself tied to this world, 
But I know where this is leading me
Please
No tears
No sympathy 

I can't say that you're losing me 
But I must be that which I am 
Though I know where this could take me
No tears
No sympathy 

Gracefully
Respectfully
Facing conflict deep inside myself 
But here confined 
Losing control of what I could not change

Gracefully
Respectfully
I ask you "Please don't worry,"
Not for me
Don't turn your back
Don't turn away

I can't say that you're losing me
I always tried to keep myself tied to this world
But I know where this is leading
Please
No tears
No sympathy

I can't say that you're losing me
But I must be that which I am
Though I know where this could take me
No tears
No sympathy

No tears for me, no sympathy
No tears for me, no sympathy
