Eyes betray the soul and bear its thinking
Beyond words, they say so many things to me
A stranger here, reborn it seems
Awaking wonders deep in me
If nothing's ventured, nothing's gained
So I must seize the day

And fighting time, so hard I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
Through my eyes, stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun, there ever standing still

It wasn't you, it wasn't me, it wasn't anything
It was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as me
I let the wind run through my hands
Before I turned to walk away
In distant days, I long to sense it, all so clear

And fighting time, so hard I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
Through my eyes stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun, there ever standing still

And fighting time, so much I ask
I will this moment last forever
Though seasons change and things come to pass
Remain inside of me
And fighting time, so hard I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still, at least for me

I had no faith before that time in any vow or deed
Days followed days and years were meaningless
Despite the wisdom of defeat
I bore my heart for all to see, the wonders I'd seen
The wonders I'd seen

And fighting time, so hard I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
Through my eyes stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun, there ever standing still

And fighting time, so much I ask
I will this moment last forever
Though seasons change and things come to pass
Remain inside of me
And fighting time so hard I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
