Chewin' on my raisinettes
Thinkin' bout what I want next
Thinking maybe I'm addicted
Checking out my pay per view
All I do is think of you
What's wrong baby, with this picture
Cause love is just too much work
Never shoulda lingered over dessert

[Chorus:]
You're the fever of my night
The dream I just can't fight
Everytime I try - busted
You're the shiver up my spine
Can't keep my cool in line
You catch my eye - busted

Love reigns supreme
But never over me
That's how I've always operated
What's that thing we had
Up in your bachelor pad
Left me so intoxicated
Love is just too much pain
Never shoulda gave you my number and name

[Chorus]

Don't want somebody to love
Just want somebody to like me
Don't want somebody too close
Just want somebody beside me
Don't want somebody too much, nothing complicated
Don't want somebody too much, too much, too much

[Chorus]
