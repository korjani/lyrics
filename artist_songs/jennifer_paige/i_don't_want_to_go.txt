You changed my world
When You came to me.
You drove a passion,
In my soul down deep,
Lord, to follow You in everything.

I don't want to go somewhere
If I know that You're not there,
'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
And I don't want to walk that road,
Be a million miles from home,
Cause my heart needs to be where You are.
So I don't want to go.

So come whatever,
(Whatever may come)
I'll stick with You.
(Right by Your side)
I'll walk You'll lead me,
Call me crazy or a fool,
For forever I promise You...

That I don't want to go somewhere
If I know that You're not there,
'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
And I don't want to walk that road,
Be a million miles from home,
Cause my heart needs to be where You are.
So I don't want to go
Without Your touch,
Without Your love
Filling me like an ocean.
For Your grace is enough,
Enough for me.

Never want to go somewhere
If I know that You're not there.
No, no, no, no.

I don't want to go somewhere
If I know that You're not there,
'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
And I don't want to walk that road,
Be a million miles from home,
Cause my heart needs to be right where You are.
So I don't want to go. No, no.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Without Your touch,
Without Your love
Filling me like an ocean.
Your grace is enough,
I don't want to go.

I don't want to go somewhere,
If I know that You're not there.
I don't want to be there without You.
Without your touch,
(I don't want to go somewhere,)
Without you love
(If I know that You're not there.
I don't want to be there without You.)
I don't want to go. No, no.
(I don't want to go somewhere,
If I know that You're not there.
I don't want to be there without You.)
If You're not there.
Filling me, loving me.
I don't want to go.
Don't want to go.
(Don't want to go, don't want to go there without you.)
There without you.
(Don't want to go)
Don't want to be
(Don't want to go, don't want to go)
There without you.
(There without you.)
