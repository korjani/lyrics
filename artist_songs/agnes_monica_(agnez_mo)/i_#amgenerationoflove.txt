I am love
I am generation of love
I don't hate
I don't gloat over my brother
In the day of his misfortune
I don't take pleasure
In seeing people's trouble
I am generation of love

Kawan-kawanku kita ini sama
Indahnya punya hati yang gembira
Teriakanku, teriakan cinta
Bersama kamu angkat suara angkat semua

(Look to the left
Look to the right)

We are generation of love
We love
We for you

Let me here say
I'm love
I am generation of love
I don't hate
Hatred is the enemy
I am love 
I am generation of love
Change the world
And the change starts within me

Aku tahu kau pernah sakit dan kecewa
Tapi jangan biarkan luka 
Buatmu tak berdaya
Teriakanku, teriakan cinta
Bersama kamu angkat suara angkat semua

Look to the left
(Look to the right)
Look to the right

I'm love
I am generation of love
I don't hate
Hatred is the enemy
I am love 
I am generation of love
Change the world
And the change starts within me

I am love
I am generation of love
I don't hate
I don't gloat over my brother
In the day of his misfortune
I don't take pleasure
In seeing people's trouble
I am generation of love
I love, I forgive
Hatred is my enemy
Love is my bullet
I will change the world
And the change starts within me
This is my truth
This is my own
We are the generation of love

Teriakanku, teriakan cinta
Bersama kamu 
(I'm love... I'm generation of love)
[repeat]

I am generation of love
