Sitting in my studio writing
Texting on the telephone
Playing little games we are laughing
We are going back and forth

Say you wanna come on over
To watch me sing in the blues
I think you might just like it
Coz I won't let it slip from you

Let's fall in love again
Tonight let's live on the edge
You're looking at me
I'm looking at you
You like what you seeing
Well I do too..
So let's fall in love again.. 
Fall in love again

Look at how you got me blushing
Like I'm sixteen years old
In your fresh white tee
And your blue jeans
Saying that I'm beautiful

You know how to get me smiling
I think I'm gonna have to confess
The good guy got me distracted
So let me play the song for you

Let's fall in love again
Tonight let's live on the edge
You're looking at me
I'm looking at you
You like what you seeing
Well I do too..
So let's fall in love again.. 
Fall in love again

Think I'm ready for a little danger boy
Such a rush when we touch
You play it dangerous
Everytime I look into your eyes
Makes me want to die right over boy

Let's fall in love again
Tonight let's live on the edge
You're looking at me
I'm looking at you
You like what you seeing
Well I do too..
So let's fall in love again.. 
Fall in love again [x2]
