I spend my time today
Just thinking of you
My heart and my mind
Are filled with missing you

I can't wait for the moments
When you finally back in my arms
So for now while you're not around
The thought of you keeps me warm

I'm wanting for your touch
And you're kisses are real in this
I hope you come home soon
But until then this is what I'd do

I'll light a candle (To say that you can hold)
Just to let you know (Just to let you know)
That I've waiting so long for you to hold me
Tell me that you will stay (Stay with me forever)
I'll light a candle in the window
All because of,

[Keith Martin]
Just the thought of you
Gets me through my days
You constantly in mind
In every single way

I can feel you touching my dreams
I don't want to open my eyes
Just to know that you're waiting for me
Makes me feel warm inside

Its only time
That keeps us apart
But in the moment
We'll be face-to-face and hard to hide

I'll light a candle
To say that you can hold (Say that you can hold)
Just to let you know (Just to let you know)
That I've waiting so long for you to hold me (Figure that you baby)
For you to hold me (For you to hold me)
Tell me that you will stay (Tell that you'll stay)
I'll light a candle in the window (Light a candle yeah)
All because of,

[Agnes]
There's nothing that I tend to know
That you coming home

[Keith Martin]
Don't you worry girl
You won't be alone to long

[Agnes]
When the morning comes and I see your face
Right next to me

[Together]
We will make it last forever
Don't ever leave

To say that you can hold (To say when you come home baby)
Just to let you know (Just to let you know)
That I've waiting so long for you to hold me
(Waiting so long for you to come home baby)
For you to hold me (For you to hold me)
Tell me that you will stay (that you will stay with me forever)
I'll light a candle in the window (Light a candle)
All because of,

Come my way
I'll light a candle (Light a candle for you)
For you to coming home (Coming home with me baby)
That I've waiting for so long for you to come back and to come back home
And we all be back inside with me
I'll light a candle in the window
Then become my way
