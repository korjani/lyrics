I don't like your cats, you don't my shoes
But I love you babe thats why I'm singin the blues
You call me right up, don't even hesitate
Don't go to New York baby, ahh

Now I'm cryin I'm here all alone
Your leavin this place that you once called home
I'm suppose to listen to you say
That we won't have one more date

Don't go to New York baby,
New York can wait, can't you see that I care
New York can wait, can't you see that I care
New York can wait, doesn't need one more person over there

Well you can go to France, or go to Timbuktu
You can even go to China if I can go with you
But as for New York, don't set one foot in that state
Don't go to New York baby New York no way

Well we've been through so much I don't want to let it all go
Well there's a little something baby my heart tells me you should know
When I'm with you, I have so much fun
In my heart you'll be the only one
But come on baby don't treat me this way 

Don't go to New York baby New York can wait 
New York can wait, baby I miss your touch
New York can wait, baby I miss your touch
New York can wait, baby I miss you
New York can wait, baby I miss you
New York can wait, baby I miss you too much
