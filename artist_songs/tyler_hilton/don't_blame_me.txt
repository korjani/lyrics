Leave you at the fast food forget to pay the pizza dude
You always got to feed my dog
I know it sounds crazy baby let me try maybe, maybe
My memory gets fogged
Well gimmie a chance we can go out to dance 
But before I go I should say
I'm only a man, I'll do as much as I can
I can't help it if I'm that way

[Chorus]
Don't blame me for something I can't change
It's not my second nature to be good like you
Let's walk around the problems that I've made
'Cause whatever happens you'll still, love me too

Forget to pick the clothes up, accidentally break your cup 
Why stop I'm on a role
I'm trying to do good get in a better mood 
Then we can really tear up the floor
Well, things haven't changed, baby, I'm still the same 
I'm not perfect and you should be glad
Take one look and listen to me play 
And you can see I'm not half bad

[Chorus]

Run around day and night barely never time to fight 
We're different from all the rest
How do you do it, putting up with me
Let me tell you baby you're the best
Well, it makes no sense having us apart
You'd have to see it or you'd be blind
When we're together I'm so confused
When we're apart your on my mind

[Chorus]

Let's take a break from our life all the pain all the strife
It sounds too good to be true
Living my life and singing my songs

And yes, baby I've got you
Well, playing six strings are my favorite things
It keeps me up while I am down
You got to believe me and you got to have faith
You can't be snooping around

[Chorus]
