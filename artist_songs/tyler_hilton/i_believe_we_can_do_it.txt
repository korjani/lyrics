Love don't come easy like it use to
It's hard to get in a modern world
I struggle everyday just to make it through
All my life not a single pearl

[Chorus]
If I'm not right
Baby, it's gotta be wrong
I'd give my life
To hold you baby once in my arms

Things will come together like it should be
And you will notice me someday
When all I can see is the you and me
I'm waiting for you to look my way

[Chorus]

Things will come together like it should be
And you will notice me someday
When all I can see is the you and me
I'm waiting for you to look my way

[Chorus 2 times]
