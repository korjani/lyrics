Everywhere you go, perfection
Follows you the wrong direction
And you will never see if for
You get all that you need and more
You see it, you want it
You find it, it's yours

But you can't say what you want or
Take what you want or
Choose the moods that you fake when you want
You said your life needed something special
Then where it's at
And aren't you glad

The only one of 5; exception
The child of your pride, deception
And on your list of things to do
Is make me fall in love with you
You find one, you want one
Cause I'm one, who plays

You can't say what you want or
Take what you want or
Choose the moods that you fake when you want
You said your life needed something special
Which you don't have

You can't say what you want or
Take what you want or
Rest and wake anyway that you want
You said your life needed something special
Well, here I am, and aren't you glad.

Now you got it bad
I know you do

You can't say what you want or
Take what you want or
Choose the moods that you fake when you want
You said your life couldn't get much better
Then where you're at

And you can't say what you want or
Take what you want or
Rest and wake anyway that you want
You said your life needed something special
Which you don't have
Well, aren't you glad
Well, aren't you glad
Well, aren't you glad
