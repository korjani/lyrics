Yeah something always sets it off 
Maybe someone's face and that's all it takes
What's wrong with a romantic whose soft
Here I go for days so I write just in case

Sometimes I wonder, when was way back then
And I know, I'll be up late again.

This could go on for quite some time
Is it wrong to think, or is it just me
I know I'm stepping way out of line
But you're the reason I sing, your not just some thing

Sometimes I wonder, when was way back then?
And I know, I'll be up late again.

Maybe it's just late night thinkin
The clock was tickin back then
And I know I'll be up late
I know I'll be up late
I know I'll be up late -- again
