One Two, One Two
Hey Jesus help me out here
I'm alone with what sure ain't clear
Cause every day I climb a mountain half the size
Than everyone else out there

And I know I'm ungrateful
I got sunshine plenty days full
But I don't mind a cloud
And a confrontation now
Just might be what I'm asking for
A silhouette from which to run
And an absence from the fun
I don't work hard enough for

But I'll be alright yeah
Maybe I'll just be a man
Or an individual
Doomed to be the lucky I am

Hey brother said listen Jesus
I've been needing a word between us
The queen of where I fall
With the keys end it all
Well she ain't getting on well

But I'll be alright yeah
Maybe I'll just be a man
Or an individual doomed to be the lucky guy I am
An individual doomed to be the lucky guy I am
