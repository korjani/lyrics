Saturday mornin, shake off the sheets and open my eyes
baby, do you know what's going on tonight?
I miss someone maybe she's not a crazy girl like you
But let me tell you baby, she's gonna do

No hesitatin, there's gonna be a picture showin now
And maybe if she's lucky dinner on the side 
Well girl I said I loved you 
Well I wrote you a song, played it many times 
With so many rhymes, what did you do?

Girl, I've been waiting for oh so long
I'd like to see him write you a song, you're my 

[Chorus]
Shy girl she's the only thing that keeps my mind
from wondering every time I'm thinkin bout you
Shy girl, it's not that I don't mind the silence every time
It's just not you

Your friends are careful, I try to read the look in their eyes
Like there all saying, "Man, I feel bad for this guy"
Maybe it's paranoia, it's all in my head I say to myself
Or maybe it's in my heart sitting on the shelf

Girl I can say I don't need you
But I know in my heart it's not true 

[Chorus]

Girl I can say I don't need you
But I know in my heart it's just not true

[Chorus 2x]
