Starting now I will never see my kitchen counter
quite the same babe, after we drank the final hour
I never knew you had it somewhere deep inside you,
another chance to go wild

You whispered to me, I'd be stupid not to follow
Where you'd be taking me tonight until tomorrow
I make predictions from the gifts my dreams have given
And never once have they lied

So, don't you worry who you're kissin on at midnight
The way I see it I've got you and I both covered
The world's to bed and you and I instead
Will secretly enjoy our time
So kiss on me tonight

The day awaits too long away when I'll be older
That holds the time to put in action what I told her
If I were perfect then there'd be no room for asking to
Fill this place by my side

So, don't you worry who you're kissin on at midnight
The way I see it I've got you and I both covered
The world's to bed and you and I instead
Will secretly enjoy our time

See I'm not worried who you're hittin on at midnight
The way I see it I've got you and I both covered
The world's to bed and you and I instead
Will secretly enjoy our time
So kiss on me tonight

Don't you worry it's time to ask yourself
But I'll be fine I'll be fine I'll be fine
If you want to kiss someone else
I've got time I've got time
I'll be fine

Now don't you worry who you're kissin on at midnight
The way I see it I've got you and I both covered
The world's to bed and you and I instead
Will secretly enjoy our time

Now don't you worry who you're kissin on at midnight
The way I see it I've got you and I both covered
The world's to bed and you and I instead
Will secretly enjoy our time
Kiss on me tonight, kiss on me tonight
Kiss on kiss on kiss on me tonight
