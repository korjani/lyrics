Well, the bus that picks him up from work is late again
It's delayed on the other side of town
Well the street he's waiting on is kind of lonely 
'Cept for an old homeless man on the ground 

He wonders what he's done so wrong to lose his job
While the woman he loves is with another man
Although the homeless man is there he knows he's all alone
And he let's off as few tears as he can

All he wants is to be happy
All he wants is a friend
'Cause he's tired of being so lonely all the time
And he thinks that it's the end

[Chorus]

Letting go and giving in
One of those games you gotta play
I know love is always a sin
Yea, It's always the same

All he wants is to be happy
All he wants is that friend
'Cause he's tired of being so lonely all the time
And he thinks that it's the end

[Chorus 2 times]

It's always the same ...........
