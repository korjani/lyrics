I know, you know, that I just can't decide
which way my heart will lead me
But you just sit, I think
Boy what should you do now
Just wait until you sink me

Girl I don't see nothin wrong with you and me together
I'll come out and shout it loud, there ain't nothing better, then my

[Chorus 1]
Nora Marie, baby can't you see
I'll make time for you, but I'll need to decide
If my Nora Marie feels the same way for me
Well I know you're new, in a way so am I, Nora Marie

Well you think you are through, but girl you ain't seen nothing yet
I get twice of what you feel
Well I'm so sure you know that I might even bet 
I'll be playing this reel to reel
Girl I don't want nothing like "boy, where have you been?"
Cause things will be going fine you take one look again, oh my 

[Chorus 2]
Nora Marie, baby can't you see
I'll make time for you, but I'll need to decide
If my Nora Marie feels the same way for me
Well I know you knew, in a way so did I, Nora Marie

You might say Ty, it would be so much safer 
even though you might be lying
But one day I swear I'll write this down on paper
but for now I'm improvising

Girl I can get all mixed up trying to be true
I think you can see the problem
Only answers you, oh my 

[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
