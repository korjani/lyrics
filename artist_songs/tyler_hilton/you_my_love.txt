Oh, and tell me
Was it all because I
Brought it up for
Conversation in a bed

And I wouldn't have started
Were it not for a blue appearing
Someone's trying to please somebody else

Many men are crying
God can't help but he's trying
To find more
Men like me
A women such as

You my love
Non existence seemed like
Nothing my love
And though I said I was scared to die
The end seemed so much greater
Then either side of the equator
Yea, you saved me
God was there to pass me
You my love

It happened on a Sunday
Which tells me there was no mistake
A half parted smile
You took my hand and breath away
And I wouldn't have loved you
If you would have
Answered my requesting
Someone's glad he never pleased himself

Many men are crying
God can't help but he's trying
To find more
Men like me
A women such as

You my love
Non existence seemed like
Nothing my love
And though I said I was scared to die
The end seemed so much greater
Then either side of the equator
But you saved me
God was there to pass me
You my love

And I wouldn't have started
If you would have
Answered my requesting
Someone's glad he never pleased himself

Many men are crying
God can't help but he's trying
To find more
Men like me
A women such as

You my love
Non existence seemed like
Nothing my love
And though I said I was scared to die
The end seemed so much greater
Then either side of the equator
But you saved me
God was there to pass me
You my love

To pass me you my love
Pass me you my love
