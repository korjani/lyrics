We can't stop now
We've come too far
There's a light up ahead but it's not where we are
And I'm no good at being on my own
Well together we're worse off than being alone

It's hard to face
But we can't go on like this
Can't you see us burning down
All it takes is everything we've got
But somehow we can't stop

We can't stop now
We're as good as gone
Yeah we pulled apart when we used to belong
Fortune finds those who wait
Yeah we knew what we had
We just got it too late

It's hard to face
But we can't go on like this
Can't you see us burning down
All it takes is everything we've got
But somehow we can't stop
We can't stop
We can't stop
Oh yeah

Oh it's hard to face
But we can't go on like this
Can't you see us burning down
We're burning down
All it takes is everything we've got
But somehow we can't stop
No somehow we can't stop

We can't stop now
We've come too far
There's a light up ahead but it's not where we are
