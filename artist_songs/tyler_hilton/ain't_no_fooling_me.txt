Said look at the girl
No you don’t know anything
Walking through my door
Yeah you use your curves to get you anything
I’ve seen your game before
Like a south bound train
Yeah you’re always going down
Any fool can see
You’ve got a pretty face
When you blow me kisses
But you ain’t fooling me
You ain’t fooling me

Cause you’re all talk
But hit me with your best shot
I know that it’s all a lie
Don’t mistake me as one for giving sympathy
Sugar now you’re out of time
And I’ve already read your mind
Cause there ain’t no fooling me

Rich man poor man don’t really matter
Any way you get paid.
Put yourself in ice
It’s like walking on water
But sugar I ain’t afraid
Cause you ain’t fooling me

Cause you’re all talk
But hit me with your best shot
I know that it’s all a lie
Don’t mistake me as one for giving sympathy
Sugar now you’re out of time
And I’ve already read your mind
Cause there ain’t no fooling me
No there ain’t no fooling me

Somewhere underneath that halo
There’s a devil hiding from the truth
They say that it takes one to know
And that’s why I see a part of me in you
Woaah, yeah

Cause you’re all talk
But hit me with your best shot
I know that it’s all a lie
Don’t mistake me as one for giving sympathy
Sugar now you’re out of time
And I’ve already read your mind
Cause there ain’t no fooling me
No there ain’t no fooling me
No there ain’t no fooling me
No there ain’t
No there ain’t
No fooling me, fooling me
