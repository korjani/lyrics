Well a kiss might be just a kiss to you
But baby it meant something to me
And a night to remember might be
Just a Monday in September
Baby it meant something to me

I know you try
It's gotta come from the heart
I know I believe it's the hardest part of love

And cause you can remember
The 22nd day in November
Baby you mean something to me

I know you try
Baby it's gotta come from the heart
I know I believe it's the hardest part of love

And a kiss might be just a kiss to you
But maybe it meant something
Or maybe it meant nothing
Baby it meant something to me
