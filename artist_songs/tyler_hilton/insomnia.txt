I miss the girl, and the cigarettes
And the more I try, the more that I forget
To think of you is a flash to find
To think of you I find my light to pass the time

You want me to be that better one
Time goes slowly with you only

Insomnia my friend
Insomnia my friend

I miss the girl and I lost my light
So I'm stumbling through this hollow room for peace of mind
I find that I am going over everything I've said to you, for you

Insomnia my friend
Insomnia my friend

You want me to be that better one
Time goes slowly with you only

You want me to be that better one
Time goes slowly with you only

Insomnia my friend
Insomnia my friend
Insomnia, insomnia

I miss the girl whose not impressed by
Insomnia and my cigarette light, my cigarette light
