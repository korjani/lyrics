Darkness finds I listen
To every little thing she has to say
And when I'm all but found its
Darkness that will lead my way

And all she ever asks me to do is
Stay awake to see a picture perfect
Moon she'll give me
She ties a ribbon to and with the stars
She lets me know she's playin with the sun
He always makes it hard for her to see me

One day me and darkness will run away and sun will see
He should have let me take her in the first place and

Stay awake to see the picture perfect moon she"ll give me
She ties a ribbon to and with the stars
She lets me know she's mine

All I ever wanted was for me and the moon to shine
And make the darkness
Stay awake to see a picture perfect moon she'll give me
She ties a ribbon to and with the stars
She lets me know that she
Stays awake to see a picture perfect moon she'll give me
She ties a ribbon to and with the stars
She lets me know she's mine
