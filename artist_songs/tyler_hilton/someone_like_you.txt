Nothing good was on T.V.
Called you up got your machine
I thought I saw you in my dream last night

Think I cried myself to sleep
I thought about you had to weep
Seems the world was very mean that's right
And I wanna see, what happened to you and me 

Thinkin bout her eyes and hair
I thought I saw you everywhere
baby, you're not playing fair anymore
You're my one and only care
But my heart you have to spare
Now all I do is sit and stare at the floor

And I wanna know

Where would you go when I'm not there
And what would you do about me and you, do you even care

[Chorus]
All this time I've been without someone like you 
Now that you're here, I've got someone to run to 
Someone like you, Someone like you 

When you're gone I have to miss
Your soft touch and your kiss
Now my heart is spilling bliss cause of you

And if I had only one wish
To say goodbye and to dismiss
The old me Mr. Pessimist for you 

But we're only friends
Comes up now and then, before I protest
And I'll keep lovin you 
Girl I promise you, I'll do my best 

[Chorus]
[repeat]
