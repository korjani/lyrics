Tomorrow I'll be leavin
But tonight I'm here with you
And lately there's been no reason
And I take all I can use

Baby, I've been waitin
I've been waitin all on my own
And selfishly I've been takin 
All I can, I'm going home

Lately there's been no problem
And I take all the love and abuse

[Chorus]
And I'll tell ya' 
Yea, I'll tell ya'
Baby it's all the truth
As I make my last promise to you

Lately there's been no problem
And I take all the love and abuse

[Chorus]
