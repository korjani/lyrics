I study up my hollow
Piece of wood to follow
A day that doesn't come
To the lucky

And I realize there's tomorrow
But I would rather wallow
In the rain then moods that seem
So pot-lucky

Well I'm cruising El Paseo
In my off-white coup back '65
Or I'm cruisin down my own street
And my hooptie says to me
You better hang on to your bench seat
I'm gonna take you for a ride

And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know

But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me
If I'm not home

So I wait for fate to find me
A ball of string unwind me
Uncomfortable as a centerfold

And I realize your behind me
To help and humankind me
To see my songs can be retold

Well I'll be gone tomorrow
Yes I'm on the road tomorrow
So next time that I see you in school
It won't be for too long

And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know

But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me
If I'm not home

And I want a leather jacket
But only if I have the time
Well, I'll comb my hair like Elvis
And grab an old Gretch 59

And you'd hardly recognize me if you
Saw me from behind

And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know

And I'll let you know
When it comes
Just when it comes
I'll let you know

But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me
If I'm not home

And I'll let you know
I'll let you know
Well I'll let you know
