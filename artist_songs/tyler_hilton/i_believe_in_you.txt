No, I've never seen the sky
As vanilla as tonight
And it's here I hold you close
When I finally close my eyes
And it never ever fails
The sun comes up, the story dies
And I don't know why

But baby, that's all I need
Is someone like you burnin' through me
Oh and it's never fair
The way that we meet and you disappear
No, it don't feel like sleep
When I'm this alive it's true
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh

It's so hard to give you up
But too easy to pretend
Like the way the leaves would fall
Tell the both of us would end
What to tell my friends

When baby, that's all I need
Is someone like you burnin' through me
Oh and it's never fair
The way that we meet and you disappear
No, it don't feel like sleep
When I'm this alive, it's true
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh yeah

What you want isn't what you get
Isn't what you want isn't what you get
What you want isn't what you get
Isn't what you want isn't what you get

I believe in you
What you want isn't what you get
Isn't what you want isn't what you get
I believe in you
What you want isn't what you get
Isn't what you want isn't what you get

'Cause baby, that's all I need
Is someone like you burnin' through me
Oh and it's never fair
The way that me meet and you disappear

Oh and it's oh' so real
The way that we talk, the way that you feel
Oh and I want to scream
But I know the fault lies with me

'Cause I believe in you, hey
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh, oh, oh, oh
