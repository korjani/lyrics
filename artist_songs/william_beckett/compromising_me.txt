Early in the morning, feet stuck underground
Gotta fix my cup of caffeine, then I'm turning things around
Climbing up the mountain, a piano on my back
Gotta cut it loose, throw away the noose and forget about the past

I know you're gonna say I'm not cool enough
Tell all your friends I screwed it up
I could give two shits, just let me breathe

I don't, I don't care what your saying about me
No I don't care
I don't, I don't care what you think about me
No I don't care
Well I can't let you be this constant compromising me

(Comatose bones in the silicon drones)

Early in the morning, feet stuck underground
Gotta fix my cup of caffeine, then I'm turning things around, yeah
Climbing up the mountain, a piano on my back
Gotta cut it loose, throw away the noose and forget about the past

I know you're gonna say I'm not cool enough
Tell all your friends I screwed it up
I could give two shits, just let me breathe

I don't, I don't care what your saying about me
No I don't care
I don't, I don't care what you think about me
No I don't care
Well I can't let you be this constant compromising me

(Comatose bones in the silicon drones)

Leaving it behind me, snake skin in my tracks
The venom could have killed me, I sucked it up and spit it back
When you finally close the window, you find an open door
But its up to you to walk right through and forget about before

I know you're gonna say I'm not cool enough
Tell all your friends that I screwed it up
I could give two shits, just let me breathe

I don't, I don't care what your saying about me
No I don't care
I don't, I don't care what you think about me
No I don't care
Well, I can't let you be this constant compromising me

Comatose bones in the silicon drones
Drowning and drowning and drowning into deep doubt
Comatose bones into silicon clones
Drowning and drowning and drowning into deep doubt
