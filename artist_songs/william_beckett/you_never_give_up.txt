You never give up
You never give up on me
You never give up on me

When I crumble beneath despair
When I can't breathe, you'll be the air

You never give up
You never give up on me, you know
You never give up on me

When my thoughts rain down in sheets
When my words fail, you are poetry

You never give up
You never give up on me
You never give up on me

When the tide swallows whole all that I've held so close
Swept away and lost for good
All I have, all I know

You never give up, oh
You never give up on me, you know
You never give up on me

Never give up
Never give up
Never give up, no, on me

Never give up
Never give up on me, on me
