She's a dangerous kind
And I like it that way
On the night we met, I sent an S.O.S.
Turned me upside down with the look on her face

She's a perfect mess
A real one of a kind
When the curtains closed, we were gettin' close
And the clothes in the corner layed there all night

Oh, she never skipped a single beat
Left me there while I was still asleep

Girl, you shoulda been a drummer
You break me down like no other
You beat my heart black and bruised
No one does it like you do
No doubt, you've got perfect rhythm
Crash and burn and then it ended
You played me so hard so fast
Just like heavy metal thunder
Girl, you shoulda been a drummer

When the morning came along
She didn't say goodbye but I didn't mind
Because a scratch is what you're gonna get
When you open the door and let a lion inside

Oh, she didn't skip a single beat
Left me there while I was still asleep

Girl, you shoulda been a drummer
You break me down like no other
You beat my heart black and bruised
No one does it like you do
No doubt, you've got perfect rhythm
Crash and burn and then it ended
You played me so hard so fast
Just like heavy metal thunder
Girl, you shoulda been a drummer

Oh, you never skip a single beat

Oh, she never skipped a single beat
Left me there while I was still asleep

Girl, you shoulda been a drummer
You break me down like no other
You beat my heart black and bruised
No one does it like you do
No doubt, you've got perfect rhythm
Crash and burn and then it ended
You played me so hard so fast
Just like heavy metal thunder
Girl, you shoulda been a drummer
Girl, you shoulda been a drummer
