Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Mickey, Hey Mickey

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
...

Fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
Cause you make me feel
Yeah you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like
...

Like the one in me
That's O.K.
Let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let's get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
...

Na na na
Come on
Na na na na na
Come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex
...

Sex baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Alright

Let's talk about sex
A little bit, a little bit

Let's talk about sex, baby
...

Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
Like you want me too
And I
...

I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It
...

It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB
Collab creations bump like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, straight up

Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor with my homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby, got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound

Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Baby [6x]
