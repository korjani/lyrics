When just a light remains
Daring dark returns like echo waves
I hope I'm not too late
For this final twist of fate

Once grief has passed me by
The pantomime of time comes healing
Feel mockery caressing me
Now that yesterday is burning free

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
I'll wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

I saw our memories die
Thought our dreams had lost their meaning
But dreams still in my heart
Are painting colours in the dark

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
I'll wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
I'll wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

Goodbye, I know our love will go on
Till silence says goodbye
