Burning out in the distance you're falling
Starting to fade
Light is condemned to be tied down by gravity close to the end
Do you still remember?
Before the weight that pulled you under
Dared you to rise

Where are you now?
Are you proud of the life you wasted?
Wearing the crown of illusion you created
You'll never know what it feels like to shine
You're the master in your own mind
But a slave to all
You are a dark star

Empty
Is never enough
You keep clawing for what you can't reach
Smothering space filled without any grace and I can't breathe
Nothing lasts forever
Even the stars will loose their luster returning to dust

Where are you now?
Are you proud of the life you wasted?
Wearing the crown of illusion you created
You'll never know what it feels like to shine
You're the master in your own mind
But a slave to all
You are a dark star
