[Tarja & Alissa:]
Endless
My war to reason
Falling to pieces
When I could see now understand
Empty
My fears of treason
Trying to blind me
The brightest void is sucking me in.

[Tarja:]
Like a million geysers still asleep
Demons in you.

Lost in the light
Eternal seek of Paradise
Scared to loose the fight
With what’s in me
Found another side,
The darkest thoughts,
The deepest sea
Where sun and moon arise
It’s me.

[Tarja & Alissa:]
Chaos
In isolation
Your only truth
What we can hear no one can understand
Madness
In desperation
A burst of anger
The shadow self is taking over.

[Alissa:]
Like a million geysers still asleep
Demons in you.

Lost in the light
Eternal seek of Paradise
Scared to loose the fight
With what’s in me
Found another side,
The darkest thoughts,
The deepest sea
Where sun and moon arise
It’s me.

[Tarja & Alissa:]
Lost in the light

Found another side,
