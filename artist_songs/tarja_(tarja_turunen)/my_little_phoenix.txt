Gracefully she's circling higher.
She has the wind beneath her wings
and looks down on us
She said:
"Robbed of my innocence, had no more time to play.
I sure got my feathers burned, but I'm stronger than the flames".

Here she comes, here she comes.
I've been waiting for so long.
Here she comes
rose again from the flames
my little Phoenix

Eternity is set in her eyes
throwing sparks back at the world that'll never die.
And I think:
"She has robbed of her innocence, had no more time to play.
She's only a little girl, but she stronger than the flames"

Here she comes, here she comes.
I've been waiting for so long.
Here she comes
rose again from the flames
my little Phoenix

Here she comes
I've been waiting for my little Phoenix

You've got to get close to the flame to see what it's made of
You've got to get close to the flame to see what you are made of.

Here she comes, here she comes.
I've been waiting for so long.
Here she comes
rose again from the flames
my little Phoenix
