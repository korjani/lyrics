Neverlight
into the shadow of my darker side
where no one finds me
How I die?
Is when you save me
Are you terrified enough to watch me go? 
I guard the boundaries of you world

Don't let my inside fall apart
a prison I don't need
Where no one ever hears your heart
Insanity

Neverlight, forever after in eternal light
I fall to pieces

Did I lie?
To form a proposition
Cast aside in my condition now
Oh, I
I guard the boundaries of you world

Don't let my inside fall apart
a prison I don't need
Where no one ever hears your heart
Insanity

So far away from me
