Wake to see your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies have risen up and overcome the brave

Greatness dies, unsung and lost, invisible to history
Embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean

You don't have long,
I am on to you. The time
it has come to destroy

Your supremacy!
Ahhh!

Ooh oh
Ooh oh

You don't have long,
I am on to you. The time
it has come to destroy

Your Supremacy!
Your!

Supremacy!

Yeah ooh yeah oh
