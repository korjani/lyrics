Made of stone
Behind the walls
A heart afraid of breaking.

Shades of fear
Stained your life
A child afraid of waking.

Numb with in
The sadness won’t find you.

No return
No way home
You’re burning all the bridges.

Stories told
I’ve read your book
Where anger writes the pages.

Search within 
The empty words
The answers you’ll find at the end.

Who do you think you are?
I gave you the stars
You made them fall from the sky
So this is my goodbye.

Swimming in the scarlet rain
Far away
Far away.

Embracing a thousand blades
Flies away
Far away.

Breaking the cage, run against the flames
Distrust and bitterness
It dies today
Lose your rage, save what stills remains
Despair and loneliness
Why you love to hate?

Washed the pain
Time in vain, thinking of tomorrow
Dust of shame
No more rain
Brush away my sorrow.
