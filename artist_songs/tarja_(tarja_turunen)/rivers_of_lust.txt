Violent hands come at midnight
Hold me down
I can't make a sound
In their arms
Still unwanted
Crave the child
Be forever wiled

Stranger, danger
Release me

Mercy's hiding
It let me go
Hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
In rivers of lust

Morning sun
Break the shelter
Turn back time
Wash away my crime

Betrayer, slayer
Release me

Mercy's hiding
It let me go
Hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
In rivers of lust

Found at noon
Clutching still the stone
