Put all your angels on the edge
Keep all the roses, I'm not dead
I left a thorn under your bed

I'm never gone

Go tell the world I'm still around
I didn't fly, I'm coming down
You are the wind, the only sound

Whisper to my heart
When hope is torn apart
And no one can save you

I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone

My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone

Go back to sleep forever more
Far from your fools and lock the door
They're all around and they'll make sure

You don't have to see
What I turned out to be
No one can help you

I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone

My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone

Waiting up in heaven
I was never far from you
Spinning down I felt your every move

I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone

My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone
