In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store
My heart start aching
My body starts shaking
An' I can't take no more

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
An' I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the still of the night
In the still of the night

In the heat of the day
I hang my head down low
An' hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to come

In the still of the night
In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the still of the night

In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
An' I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the still of the night
