Pioneer of aerodynamics 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
they thought he was real smart alec 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
he thought big they called it a phallic 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
they didn't know he was panoramic 

little eiffel stands in the archway 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
keeping low doesn't make no sense 
sometimes people can be oh so dense 
they didn't want it but he built it anyway 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
little eiffel stands in the archway 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
keeping low don't make sense 
keeping low doesn't make no-sense 
(little eiffel, little eiffel) 
little eiffel stands in the archway 

oh alexander i see you beneath 
the archway of aerodynamics.
