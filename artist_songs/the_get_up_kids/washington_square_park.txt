it's better than nothing
it's better than you can get
what more could you want, what more could you ask for?
living day by day is more than i can say about my life
living in denial, wipe taht stupid smile away
through that ring again 
through that sick machine that doesn't make you any stronger 
than you or anything you choose
it's not abuse that many people live through
