Sooner or later more, 
These words to paper pour. 
Compose apologies, To bring you back to me. 
What words were written for: 
One girl whose pages tore. 
I'll bet you never knew, With a letter came a fool for you. 
She says she'd worked it out, 
This room's not big enough for two. 
He swears she'd work his words out, If she ever knew. 
How do I find her, Bearing my heart in hand. 
Last winter, Anne Arbour Was all I had. 
I still wear your heart around my throat 
I still wear your heart around my throat 
With barely the air not to choke. 
Never, not ever again. 
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away. 
Now that it's over, I'm older and colder this way. 
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away. 
How do I find her, Bearing my heart in my hand. 
Last winter, Anne Arbour was all I had.
