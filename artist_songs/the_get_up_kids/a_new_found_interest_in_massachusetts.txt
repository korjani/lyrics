If I told you that I was thinking of moving east, 
would you save a place for me? 
I'll come home cause it's worse that I expected. 
A place in my heart for my home to the west 
where we'll watch the same sunsets, 
and when I doubt... 
I'll look east and lock my heart in a brass box 
to newfound mass. 
I'm breaking off but this is my home. 
I'd do anything for you, 
give you the world if I could. 
Is that what you want me to do? 
These bridges and boundaries are bringing me closer to you.
