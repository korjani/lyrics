I've waited hours for this 
I've made myself so sick 
I wish I'd stayed asleep today 
I never thought that this day would end 
I never thought that tonight could ever be 
This close to me 

Just try to see in the dark 
Just try to make it work 
To feel the fear before you're here 
I make the shapes come much too close 
I pull my eyes out 
Hold my breath 
And wait until I shake 

But if I had your faith 
Then I could make it safe and clean 
If only I was sure 
That my head on the door was a dream 

I've waited hours for this 
I've made myself so sick 
I wish I'd stayed asleep today 
I never thought that this day would end 
I never thought that tonight could ever be 
This close to me 

But if I had your face 
I could make it safe and clean 
If only I was sure 
That my hand in the door 
Was a dream
