All poison and thrills a handful of pills waiting around nails cut to the quick yeah you
Broke what you fixed you're so underground what you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
It's said and done

But it's too late to turn your age around she's no the one you want

One settles a score with a trip to the floor look what we've found make sense of the scene
Keep a routine? standing on sound what you waiting for?
What you waiting for? it's said and done

But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want

How do you do it?
With your back against the wall how do you ruin all these promises?
Promises and nothing else done.

But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want so tell me something
That I didn't know.
