would you stay for one night? 
if i didn't come home? 
the end of a big fight 
doesn't matter anymore 
the point in my midlife 
situation stands 
but hours pass like years 
wish you were here 
wish you were here 
did i open an old wound? 
is there something i should know? 
if it's all ending so soon 
how could i possibly let go? 
comes to a head, this is high noon 
the finale we have planned 
but hours pass like years 
i wish you were here 
say the words so slow 
say it without fear 
you won't turn to go 
you won't leave me here 
the past is all we know 
the memories are clear 
i wish you were here 
if i told you, were you listening? 
did you know this from the start? 
do the dates match exactly? 
your plan when we would part? 
if i won't wait for another year 
i guess you'll break my heart 
it's true 
you already knew 
so take this as a souvenir 
remember me, i'm waiting here 
disappointed, hanging on 
stayed behind while you moved on 
wish you were here
