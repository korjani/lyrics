You're a few years overdue.
I spent them waiting here for you.
Now your charity's refused,
I can name a penance for abuse.

Twenty four years overdue,
what kind of role model are you?
Very least learn not to do,
I think I might be over you.

Do hope I won't 
Learn to make 
The same mistakes, 
That you would 
Make me aware 
That only fear, 
My only hope, 
Is letting go.

Went on a limb for you,
Capsized when I turned twenty two.
Did it burn as bad for you?
No bottle serves to soothe my wounds.

Do hope I won't 
Learn to make 
The same mistakes, 
That you would 
Make me aware 
That only fear, 
My only hope, 
Is letting go. 
My only hope 
Is letting go.

You're a few years overdue.
I spent them waiting here for you.
