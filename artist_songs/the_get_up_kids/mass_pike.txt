I wonder when I wander home If I'll be fit to drink alone. 
Sleep with my memories, Pictures, apologies. 
For every minute yesterday, Regret reminds me anyway. 
If I remember anything, I'll make mistakes again. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, Thought I was losing you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, I fell in love with you. 
I will declare a holiday, The night that she turned me away. 
I'm drowning in my miseries It solves everything. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, Thought I was losing you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, I fell in love with you. 
With you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, Thought I was losing you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, I fell in love with you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, Thought I was losing you. 
Last night on the Mass Pike, I fell in love with you.
