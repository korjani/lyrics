Rows of houses on forever what the neighbors never know when the hammer fell the kettle
Whistle yells all good sinners go to hell serpent turns onto itself

Did it occur to you too?
What was the worst you could do?
You wouldn't believe it,
Wouldn't believe it I don't believe it too.

Can you really keep a secret cross your heart and hope to die?
May be an evil one the mind
Is all but gone trespass fits you like a charm a scarlet letter on your arm

Did it occur to you too?
What was the worst you could do?
You wouldn't believe it,
Wouldn't believe it I don't believe it too.

Answer me, will you be received?
