Frankie died just the other night 
Some say it was suicide 
But we know 
How the story goes 

With his six string knife 
And his street-wise pride 
The boy was a man before his time 
And she knew 
All their dreams would come true 

But ya see Frankie was fast 
He was too fast to know 
He wouldn't go slow 
Until his lethal dose 
And she knows 
He'll finally come too close 

[Chorus]
Well on with the show 
Going on with the show 
Come on baby 
No, no, no 
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my 

[Chorus]

He was bad 
He was never good 
But one thing that he understood 
And she knew 
All these lies would come true 

The time has come 
And he's paid his dues 
And Suzy finally got the news 
She always knew 
This day would come soon 

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

He was stopped on a dime 
With a switchblade knife 
Some damn punk went and 
Took Frankie's life 
And she knew 
She'd have to pull through 

Broken down 
With his broken dreams 
With a wink of an eye 
Said Suzy, listen to me 
You must go 
On with the show 

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Oh baby
