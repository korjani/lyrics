The colors are flowing from the wall to the floor
And only an outline still remains
Cause the roof's got a hole in it
And everything's been ruined by the rain

There may be diamonds in that dream on the hill
But the people who live there still complain
Cause the roof's got a hole in it
And everything is soaking in the rain

No one can practice common sense that they see
Through the nickel and diming and I'll explain
When the roof's got a hole in it
Everything gets ruined by the rain

My head's got a hole in it
And everything's been ruined by the rain
