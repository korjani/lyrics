Laughing gold carried on silver
Open robe waving by the trailer

This is paradise

Ivory whales high on corn bread
Wind-filled sails, fly to the door step

This is paradise

Hey little girl, hey young lady
I'm not wrong, don't say maybe

This is paradise

Out at night, gazing at the heavens
Hold on tight, hold on eleven

This is paradise
This is paradise
