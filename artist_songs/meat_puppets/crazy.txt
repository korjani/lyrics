Whoa, crazy, got myself a job
Oh, crazy, one more bank to rob
I was lazy, had no fun in a while
Now, crazy, I got a reason to smile

When icy rain is falling
Then I can hear you call

Oh, this popstand, got no ocean view
Still I'm happy, something feel so new
Drop the problem, unless it's something you need
Oh, crazy, plant a different seed

I love the clothes you're wearing
But won't you let them fall

Take a minute, take an hour or two
Oh, crazy, I got nothing to do
Crazy moonbeams cover up the sky
Oh, crazy, you're the light in my eye

And after one has fallen
I got to have it all
