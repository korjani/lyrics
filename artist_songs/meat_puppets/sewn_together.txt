Forget yourself, you only wanna be alone
You bought the shelf, you're living like a dusty bone
Gas is high tonight and all the horses flown

And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time

Suit yourself, you're dressing for another time
Rotten bell is hanging from a dusty vine
Blue and silver shards of broken candle light

And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time

I watch my fall, step on my head again
I just took all the rest of the medicine
I pay myself tonight so I can be my friend

And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time

Blue and silver shards of broken candle light

And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time
And it's all sewn together this time
