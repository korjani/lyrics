C'monna, y'wanna, surely

Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Smoking and poking, changing
in the blink of an eye
Fly high by my window at night...
Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Lately a message talks about
a place in the world
Little by little the
mystery begins to uncurl
Snakey's awakey and he wants a
little piece o' the pie
C'monna, y'wanna, surely
this'll cause you to die
C'mon over here, take this
and stick it down your
throat
Hope you don't choke on it

Kissing dogs
Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Attacked by monsters
Kissing dogs
Attacked by monsters
