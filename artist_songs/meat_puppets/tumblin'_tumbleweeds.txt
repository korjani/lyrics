I keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the ranch I belong
Driftin' along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Know where they're gone, but I'm fine
Just where the trailer will whine
Driftin' along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
I know when night is gone
That I knew [?]
I keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the ranch I belong
Driftin' along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
I keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the ranch I belong
Driftin' along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
See them tumblin' down
