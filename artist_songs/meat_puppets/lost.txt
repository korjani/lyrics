Lost on the freeway again
Looking for means to an end
Nobody knows which way its gonna bend
Lost on the freeway again

Walking the freeze ways again
Thinking of something my friend
I get tired of living Nixons mess
Walking the freeze ways again

I know there'll come a day 
When you'll say that you know me
I know there'll come a time 
When theres nothing in it that he ows me anymore

Locked in the attic again
Out of the shadow and into deep end 
I've got a rule I know will never end
Locked in the attic again

I know there'll come a day
When you'll say that you know me
I know there'll come a time 
When theres nothing in it that he owes me anymore

Lost on the freeway again
Looking for means to an end
Nobody knows which way its gonna bend
Lost on the freeway again

I know there'll come a day
When you'll say that you know me
I know there'll come a time 
When theres nothing in it that he owes me anymore
