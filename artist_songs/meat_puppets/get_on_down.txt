Way off down the road
There comes Wagon Red
Found himself a nickel
Went straight to his head

Get on down
Get on down 
Get on down
Whoa

I looked out my window
I saw Medium Joe
Lighting both ends of his candle
Glowing from head to toe

Get on down 
Get on down
Get on down
Whoa 

New car cherry tomato
Pulled off all the doors
Pulled off the steering wheel
Got the pedal taped to the floor

Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Whoa

Get on down
Get on down 
Get on down
Whoa

Get on down
Get on down
Get on down 
Whoa

Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Whoa
