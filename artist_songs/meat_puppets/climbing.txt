Climb, climb, I always climb
Out of bed in the morning
On a mountain made of sand
And I know this doesn't rhyme
But the clutter on the table
Is getting out of hand
I know you tried to see me through
But honey I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you

Time, time, it's so sublime 
Well, they say it's non-existent
But it's playing with my mind
And phone calls don't cost a dime
In the caverns of your feelings
Where the sun will never shine
I know that you tried to see me through
But honey I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you

Mine, mine, which things are mine?
Well, I thought I saw a few
Before I found out I was blind
And I think I see a sign
And it's saying where to go
And when I get there what I'll find
I know you tried to see me through
But honey, I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you
