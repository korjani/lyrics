You said I shouldn't have gone
I don't know I went ahead on anyway
Night time wore to dawn
I found my free will had gone away from me
Behind the masks that pass for faces
Hours are lost in forbidden places

Nowhere for me to run
Not that I feel like running anywhere anyway
Some things are clear at night
Then become confusing in the light of day

Within the darkness
Behind the faces
Pioneers of forbidden places

Something I wouldn't have thought
Crept up from behind me now it's here to stay
Too real although it's not
Couldn't have possibly been avoided anyway

The crazy landscapes behind the faces,
Holding back the forbidden places
Abolished music, lost for ages
The living words of forbidden pages

Though dust has gathered on honest feeling
Forbidden truths through twilight stealing
And in the eyes of the listless faces
Glisten hints of forbidden places
