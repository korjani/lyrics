How much do I owe you? 
I'll pay but I don't want to
Go where I go to
Days of where I came from
In a restaurant in Mexico

Told me not to drink the water
And not to touch the food
All we got is Pepsi Cola
And we know that it won't hold you

But remember what we told you
No one else knows what's in store
Remember that we told you

How much do I owe you?
I'll pay but I don't want to
Go where I go to
Days of where I came from
In a restaurant in Mexico

Told me not to drink the water
And not to touch the food
All we've got is Pepsi
And we know that it won't hold you

But remember what we told you
No one else knows what's in store
Remember that we told you
