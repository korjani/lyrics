Can I have a moment of your time 
And leave this far behind 
Can you find the time to take a chance 
Just walk with me tonight 

Even though the rain must fall 
Baby that will pass 
Listen to the words I say 
I've saved them just for you 

You're safe with me tonight 
And Always 
As sure as this full moon 
And Always 

Lets sit around and shed those lonely tears 
While days turn into years 

Even though the rain must fall 
Baby that will pass 
Listen to the words I say 
I've saved them just for you 

You're safe with me tonight 
And Always 
As sure as this full moon 
And Always 

Nothing lasts not the good times or the bad 
They all just become the past 
Sometimes your heart can turn on dime 
What made you cry will one day make you smile 

You're safe with me tonight 
And Always 
As sure as this full moon 
You're safe with me tonight 
And Always
