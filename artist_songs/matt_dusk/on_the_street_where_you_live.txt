I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always been beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I'd rather be
Let the time go by, I don't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live.

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I'd rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live
Can be here on the street where you live.
