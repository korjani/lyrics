Last night I said these words to my girl 
I know you never even try girl 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, 
Please please me like I please you. 
You don't need me to show the way love 
Why do I always have to say love 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, 
Please please me like I please you. 
I don't want to sound complaining 
But you know there's always rain in my heart. 
I do all the pleaseing with you 
It's so hard to reason with you. 
Oh yeh why do you make me blue. 
Last night i said these words to my girl 
I know you never even try girl 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, 
Please please me like I please you - you.
