[VERSE 1]
Summer wind blows in again 
Sometimes I wonder where we lost it 
My good intentions—your favorite weapons 
And still I've yet to learn my lesson 
Who-oah 

[VERSE 2]
No, I don't need much of anything 
Just a shady tree and a couple pulls of whiskey 
To write my songs of love and life and loss 
And just a few bout you 
So if you'll hear me out 

[CHORUS 1]
Stay with me, we don't never have to leave 
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams 
So don't you laugh—Notre Dame he had his chance 
And he's a good, good man 
But there's some things he just don't understand 
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days 
I think that you should stay 
Oh, won't you stay 
Hmmmm 

[VERSE 3]
So come on down, I'll show you how 
Us midwest boys like to party 
So grab a beer…And get over here 
Summer's drawin near 
Don't waste another year…hey, hey, hey! 

[CHORUS 2]
Stay with me, we don't never have to leave 
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams 
So don't get mad—what's past is in the past 
And we can make this last 
if you just give me that chance 
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days 
I think that you should... 

[TAG]
Stay with me 
all summer 
Stay with me 
under the covers 
Stay with me 
Be my lover 

[BRIDGE]
Walkin through that old gate 
It’s quite a site to see 
That handsome face in this desert place 
Getting away from me 
That's juxtaposition 
But right now it’s indecision 
Do I go back out 
and chase you down? 
Or will you be the one that got away? 
No, no, no 

[CHORUS 3]
Stay with me, we don't never have to leave 
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams 
So don't get mad—what's past is in the past 
And we can make this last 
if you just give me that chance 
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days 
I think that you should... 

[TAG x2]
Stay with me 
all summer 
Stay with me 
under the covers 
Stay with me 
Be my lover
