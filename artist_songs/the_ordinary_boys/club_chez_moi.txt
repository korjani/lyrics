I can hear the city sing its lustful lullaby 
And see the drugs spill down the drains into the night 
Well I made this bed of nails that I'm sleeping in today 
I can't just close my eyes and ignore it all away 

Dance with me tonight it's late and I don't want to fight so out of mind so out of sight so what so dance with me tonight 

Dance with me tonight, dance with me tonight 

I can tell you you go out til the lights go on 
And when the lights go out well we may well carry on 
Will you ever find this needle in a cul-de-sac? 
It's only club chez moi and I'm giving something back 

Dance with me tonight it's late and I don't want to fight so out of mind so out of sight so what so dance with me tonight 

Dance with me tonight, dance with me tonight 

I can hear the city sing in perfect harmony 
Late night taxi bright lights try enticing me 
Well I set this rat trap but I'm falling in today 
I can just close my eyes but it will not go away 

Dance with me tonight it's late and I don't want to fight so out of mind so out of sight so what so dance with me tonight 

Dance with me tonight, dance with me tonight
