I cross my fingers on a Monday morning 
I keep on smiling and I keep on singing 
So sure that I don't deserve it 
My throat aches and my ears are ringing 

Believing in coincidence 
In running risks not common sense 
In the wrong place at the right time 
I'll take the blame cos it's all mine 

We've got the best job ever 
It will be over sooner or never 
At the risk of sounding clever 
I want the best job ever forever 

We've got the best job ever. oh oh [x2]

I try to stop myself from being boring 
And try to remind myself who is laughing 
I try to act like it's not so exciting 
Desperate that my 15 seconds is passing 

Though what it's luck we rely on 
A force so weak it seems so strong 
In the right place at the wrong time 
I'll take the chance the choice is mine 

We've got the best job ever 
It will be over sooner or never 
At the risk of sounding clever 
I want the best job ever forever 

We've got the best job ever oh oh [x2]

Believing in coincidence 
In running risks not common sense 
In the wrong place at the right time 
I'll take the blame cos it's all mine 

We've got the best job ever 
It will be over sooner or never 
At the risk of sounding clever 
I want the best job ever forever 

We've got the best job ever oh oh [x2]

We've got the best job ever [REPEAT]
