Over the counter culture,
Well that's right where you belong,
You try to sever your ties with the London skies,
But you've got the whole thing wrong.

You try to be so different,
As does everybody else,
Create your own distinctions,
And flaunt them for yourself.

Over the counter culture,
With your cards and catalogues,
The mainstream wipes the river bed clean,
You're just wrong, you're just... wrong.

You think you followed your heart again,
Now it's in to be out,
Destroy the plans and just start again,
Don't pretend to not pretend at all.

Over the counter culture,
Well you live your life in waves,
Last year's dream was a terrible scheme,
This new fad will fade.

Let's see... what can we be now?
That hasn't been done before?
Shut your eyes,
Look inside.

You think you followed your heart again,
Now it's in to be out,
Destroy the plans and just start again,
Don't pretend to not pretend at all.

Don't pretend to not pretend at all.
Don't pretend to not pretend at all!
