I'm not gonna to patronise ya 
But trying to write down why I like ya 
It doesn't make it any better 
To just steal kind words off Phil Spector 

And I know all these tired cliches 
But I don't know which cliche to say 
Because cliches don't have any impact 
So I guess I will be matter-of-fact 

Cos...It's so good to know ya 
I just don't know how to show ya 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you 

I'm so sorry that I'm losing 
When other boys would leave you swooning 
When I finally get my words together 
I choke and they are gone forever 

But words are words and they mean nothing 
Surely I love you counts for something! 
So let's be hasty, and let's be reckless 
Just being with you leaves me breathless 

Cos...It's so good to know ya 
I just don't know how to show ya 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you 

It's so good to know ya 
I just don't know how to show ya 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you 

I love you, you know that 
Don't you? 
I love you....
