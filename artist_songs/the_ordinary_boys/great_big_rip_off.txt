It found us 
It drowned us 
It's not us it's the world around us 

Get ready 
For this tip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 

It's not dirty it's clean 
It's not you who told me 
Let's let the world around us 
Take the blame for everything 

Work is a four letter word 
And I'm trying 
It's sad it's true that sex sells 
And I'm buying 

Big rip off, big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 
Big rip off, big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 

And you get nothing for free 
Darling you can have me 
Let's let the world around us 
Take the blame for everything 

And I will trying anything twice 
Why bother? 
And if it's especially nice 
Maybe another 

Big rip off, big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 
Big rip off, big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 

It's not dirty it's clean 
It's not you who told me 
Let's let the world around us 
Take the blame for everything 

Big rip off, the big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off 
Big rip off, the big rip off 
Get ready it's the great big rip-off [x4]
