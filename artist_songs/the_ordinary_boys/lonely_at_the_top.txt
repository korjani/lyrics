This is a song for all of my close friends 
Anonymous neighbours with stories to tell 
I didn't realise I had so many close friends nameless and shameless with history to sell 

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it 
I want pride but I know I'll never get it 
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes 
I want love but my heart's not in it 

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much, but its never enough 
If only it was lonely at the top 
If only it was lonely at the top 

Oh oh oh oh, Hey hey, If only it was Lonely at the Top 

This is a song for all the complainers 
All the campaigners who will not give up 
They're selling their souls just to wear their sunglasses 
They say "stop the press, I want to get off" 

What's the fuss? I've gotta be in it to win it 
I want pride but i know I'll never get it 
Shame, I wanna live for 15 minutes 
I want love but my heart's not in it 

If only it was lonely at the top 
I've got too much, but it's never enough, 
If only it was lonely at the top, 
If only it was lonely... 

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it 
I want pride but I know I'll never get it 
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes 
I want love but my heart's not in it 

Oh oh oh oh, Hey hey 

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much but its never enough 
If only it was lonely at the top 
If only it was lonely at the top
