Radio play just depresses me today
Why is it so throw away
The lists that you write
Just to classify this tripe
When clearly it all sounds the same
Oh oh oh
Well I've heard it all done before
A hundred years ago or more
Originality is so passe
Just the same old politics
Through pretentious effects units
By self-obsessive slobs
The list goes on

Media press has become an utter mess
The opinions of failed pop stars
They constantly try to divert the public eye
Led by large cash deposits and such

Well I've heard it all done before
A hundred years ago or more
Originality is so passe
Forgotten genres get rehatched
Create the craze, create the cash
Would you buy anything?
The list goes on

And I will try
Not to let this get to me
But it goes on
It goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on...

Oh I've heard it all done before
A hundred years ago or more
Originality is so passe
I'll never lose my faith in you
When nothing's good what can you do?
Just don't buy anything
The list goes on
