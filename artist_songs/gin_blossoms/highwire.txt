I wanna take you so far
But they don't want to let us out
But they do, they do, they do
I don't wanna walk on that highwire
They ain't gonna let us down
But they do, they do, they do
What I could never believe in
I was never really even
And I forgot about the cost
And then I got lost, I got lost, I got lost, I got lost
Didn't really wanna live it over
Or even wanna live it down
But I do, I do, I do
What I could never believe in
I was never really even
And I forgot about the cost
And then I got lost, I got lost, I got lost, I got lost
Didn't really wanna live it over
Or even wanna live it down
But I do, I do, I do...
