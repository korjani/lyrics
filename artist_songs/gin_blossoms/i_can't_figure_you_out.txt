Who's to say what's right or wrong
If I stand out in the rain too long
Filling up my drinking cup
When I know I've had much more than enough
Write in the pages of my notebook
But they never sound the way they look
Kicking at this old tin can
And I wonder where the hell I am
I can't figure you out
I can't figure you out
When it seems so fine
When it's held to the light
I can't figure you out
I can't figure you out
They push and pull till it breaks in half
I never trust a guy with a nervous laugh
Worried 'bout the smallest things
While the world is coming crashing in
I can't figure you out...
