So I guess I must have just been dreaming
When I thought I heard myself say no
Anyway it looks like no one heard me so here I go
Cause when you're in the company of strangers 
Or just the strangers you call friends
You know before you start just how it's going to end
When the doors swing open and all the drinks are passed around
Anytime the pickins look too easy...hold me down
I can't remember why I like this feeling 
When it only seems to let me down
Soon I find I'm searching for the exit from the ground
If I think the room is turning faster
Then I think the music is too loud
By then I've lived another broken story to let me down
When those doors swing open and all the drinks are passed around
When half the party moves into the bathroom...hold me down
Or if you're at the tail end of the evening 
And Dr. Feelgood comes around
Anytime the pickins look too easy...hold me down
Down if I want that part
Down if I've gone too far
Well I guess I must have just been reeling
When I felt myself begin to fall
I realize I'm bounding down the hallways and off the walls
If my bed was standing in the corner 
I could just fall into it right now
And know that I'd just be staring at the ceiling going round
When those doors swing open and all the drinks are passed around
Anytime the pickins look too easy...hold me down
