She could be anywhere at all
I know I'm heading for a fall
Well I want to see her every night
I make a wish and hold her tight
I want to wake up next to her
But I know there's something wrong
We used to have all kinds of things
Now I know the pain heartache can bring
Well I want to see her every night
I make a wish and hold her tight
I want to wake up next to her
But I know there's something wrong
'Cause I can be waiting around all the time
I'll wait for that girl
She could be anywhere at all
I know I'm heading for a fall
Well I want to see her every night
I make a wish and hold her tight
I want to wake up next to her
But I know there's something wrong...
