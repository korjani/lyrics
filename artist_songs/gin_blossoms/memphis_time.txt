Hey, now it's all right
Hey now, it's fine, it's cool
Seems we've done our worst
It's time to head for school
And so we tripped upstairs
I seen the sun come up
Judging by your shape
I think you've had enough
It's Memphis time
Just string that old guitar
Tune it up to Memphis time
Hey, now I couldn't know
Baby, I couldn't tell
Just what's going on
Inside of someone else
You know that this small world
Sometimes this big town
It can drag you up
As well as drag you down
It's Memphis time
Just string that old guitar
Tune it up to Memphis
You can't say that I've been right
I can't say that you've been wrong 
We knew it all along
(Take cover Scotty)
So we tripped upstairs
I seen the sun come up
Judging by your shape
I think you've enough
It's Memphis time
Just string that old guitar
And tune it up to Memphis time...
