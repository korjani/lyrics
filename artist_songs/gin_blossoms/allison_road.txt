I've lost my mind on what I'd find
And all of the pressure that I left behind
On Allison Road
Fools in the rain if the sun gets through
Fire's in the heaven of the eyes I knew
On Allison Road
Dark clouds file in when the moon is near
Birds fly by A.M. in her bedroom stare
There was no tellin' what I might find
I couldn't see I was lost at the time...
Yeah I didn't know I was lost at the time
On Allison Road
So she fills up her sails with my wasted breath
And each one's more wasted than the other you can bet
On Allison Road
Now I can't hide so why not drive
I know I want to love her but I can't decide 
On Allison Road
I didn't know I was lost at the time
So I went looking for an exit sign
All I wanted to find tonight...
