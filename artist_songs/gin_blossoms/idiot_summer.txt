I walked home to the sun
I couldn't ride another one
I thought a lot along the lines
And I've been fooled about all night
Wiped clean always by midnight
Wasn't it like an idiot summer...
Three, four peaks all I could see
In the morning it's a hundred and ten degrees
But I like the goddamn heat
I lie awake half the night
Autumn is coming it seems like it's in sight
All the autumn that you can see
All the autumn that you can see
It's growing darker like the trees
But if all the trees should fall
All the bugs would crawl in my sleep
and then it's cold
It's growing darker like the trees
But if all the trees should fall
All the bugs would crawl in my sleep
and then it's cold
There's no telling I was so confused
I try but I can't help you choose
Tucson is so far away
I lie awake half the night
Autumn is coming it seems like it's in sight
Wasn't it like an idiot summer...
