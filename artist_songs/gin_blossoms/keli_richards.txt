She came to L.A. all the way from Boston town
She wound up on the screen where I saw her goin' down
Now I can't see you, I can't see you at all
No I don't know you, I don't know you at all
I bought her films, yeah I bought all her magazines
And I watched her every move until I saw her in my dreams
Now I can't stand it, see you caught from behind
No I don't know you, girl you gotta be mine
Keli Richards come on...
Well I bought a gun, there's just one thing left to do
Now I can't make up my mind it comes down to me or you
Now I can't see you, I can't see you at all
No I don't know you, I don't know you at all
Keli Richards come on...
