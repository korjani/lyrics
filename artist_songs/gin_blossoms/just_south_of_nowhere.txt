Meet me out past the cottonwoods where we ran as kids
Straight out past the cemetery where the river turns to ditch
This car I'm driving can't drive me fast enough
Thirty miles of potholed roads got me shaking like a drunk
Straight back far away a long ways from here
Just south of nowhere
Static on the radio gave out five miles back
And I'm singing some old Marshalls song just for laughs
My head aches from cigarettes my eyes are edged with sleep
Meet out past the muddy ditch beneath the palos verdes trees
Straight back far away a long ways from here 
Just south of nowhere
Monday morning takes me back to where I have to be
Full of half assed-promises this shit just ain't for me
Meet me out past the cottonwoods where we ran as kids
Straight out past the cemetery where the river turns to ditch
Straight back far away a long ways from here
Just south of nowhere...
