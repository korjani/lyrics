It's like trying to light a cigarette
When the matches you got are soaking wet
Tallest buildings they got are bound to fall
When it's coming down like a wrecking ball
Slow down, Virginia
Don't make me wait
Slow down, Virginia
Don't make me wait
Virginia
It's everything that's cool rolled into one
Everything that's not is left alone
You can hear it ring from near and far
You can hear it scream like a fire alarm
Slow down, Virginia
Don't make me wait
Slow down, Virginia
Don't make me wait
Virginia
Sometimes it sounds like she's been crying
But when she lights, this whole dump is...
It's everything that's cool rolled into one
Everything that's not is left alone
You can hear it ring from near and far
You can hear it scream like a fire alarm
Slow down, Virginia...
