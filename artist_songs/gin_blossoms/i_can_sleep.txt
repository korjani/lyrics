She can be anywhere she wants to be tonight
In the arms of another man I know
But that won't bring me down on the night I've got tonight
There's nothing there, can you understand at all???
Cause I can sleep without you...
I've got no reason to doubt it
I can't live without it
I ain't in no big hurry
My life ain't filled with worries
Lots of men tie themselves in knots all over you
That's something I promised myself I'd never ever do
Cause life's too short to go on living with this sin
Cause I saw a pretty face and you know I'd cave right in
Cause I can sleep without you...
Well I've got no reason to doubt it
I can't live without it
I ain't in no big hurry
But I've been filled with worries
Well she can be anywhere she wants to be tonight
In the arms of another man I know
But that won't bring me down on the night I've got tonight
There's nothing there, can you understand at all??
Cause I can sleep without you...
Well I've got no reason to doubt it
I can't live without it
I ain't in no big hurry
But I've been filled with worries
I can I can I can sleep without you...
