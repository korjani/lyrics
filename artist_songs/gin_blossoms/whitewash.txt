This night never happened
If it's all right with you
Not a word of our weakness
So much as a clue
There's a place outside
I'm glad to play no part
The fairest arms can tally up the faintest stars
Wash away my weekend
Shatter my sight
C'mon sweet amnesia
You're needed here tonight
Take a seat in the shadows
Forget it as it goes
Dissipate in the morning air
All you know
If you find out
You'll find every lie you might
I was nowhere near last night
Whitewash everything in sight
These suspicions have been long drained dry
Our persistence holds them here
A maze of bars and rented rooms remain
Enough to make you almost look away
This night never happened
If it's all right with you
Another for the collection of things we didn't do
That private party is over
Thank God we get new starts
The fairest arms still tally up the faintest stars
When it comes down
In a clear and certain light
I was nowhere near last night
I was nowhere near last night
Whitewash everything in sight...
