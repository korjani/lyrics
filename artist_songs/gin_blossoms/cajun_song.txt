Well, she's leaving today I do know so far away
I'm feeling so blue and it shows in every single way
Once that girl she was mine for such a short time
We used to spend every night now all I do is cry
They say you can't miss something you've never had
So tell me why 
Why I could feel so bad...
We used to walk down the path just like lovers do
She'd hold my hand and we'd laugh
I'd stare in her eyes they were blue
Once that girl she was mine for such a short time
We used to spend every night now all I do is cry
They say you can't miss something that you've never had
So tell me why 
Why I could feel so bad...
