Summer came too early
Springtime came too late
The weather went from freezing
To bleached out summer days
Hold up in your bedroom
Hangin like two thieves
Countin up the hours
For the perfect time to leave

[Chorus:]
Woooo Hooo
We're learning the hard way
Woooo Hooo
It just don't matter what they say

Nightime through this desert
Drivin straight out west
Stop for gas and coffee
You close your eyes for rest
I wonder what your dreaming
Why we're half way cross this bridge
We've come too far too turn back
We're just too close to quit

[Chorus:]
Woooo Hooo
We're learning the hard way
Woooo Hooo
It just don't matter what they say
Woooo Hooo
We're learning the hard way
Woooo Hooo Woooo Hooo

[Guitar Solo]

Pent up in your bedroom
Hangin like two thieves
Countin up the hours
For the perfect time to leave

[Chorus:]
Woooo Hooo
We're learning the hard way
Woooo Hooo
It just don't matter what they say
Woooo Hooo
We're learning the hard way
Woooo Hooo Woooo Hooo
