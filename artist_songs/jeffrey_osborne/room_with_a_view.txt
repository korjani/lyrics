I've been working so hard trying to make my way
When this hole? world coming creening? place
I close my eyes and I see your face
With your sweet love I got everything
I'll come home girl I feel like a cheer?

[Chorus:]
Cause I got a room without view
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you
He's the moss? I see trough
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you

When the day has ended and I'm close to you
In times when I feel that my spirits is gone
You gave me strength that kept me carry on
I won't squeexe the crap? till my curveaffair?
I don't notice honny I don't care

[Chorus:]
Cause I got a room without view
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you
He's the moss? I see through
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you

He can love on the heart of floor
I love when you tore? the shade? and you ask? for more

In times when I feel that's my spirits is gone
You gave me strength that kept me carry on
I won't squeeze the crap? till my curveaffair?
I don't notice honny I don't care

[Chorus:]
Cause I got a room without view
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you
He's the moss? I see trough
When I'm looking at you when I'm looking at you
You are everything me make me feel like a king
When I see your... face this world becomes an amusable place
