I stand back when love tries to touch me
And I know that it's wrong but I'm safe when I'm strong
Keeping feelings locked in this sheltered heart of mine
Said, "I'll never give in", then I see you again

And with one touch I'm all caught up
In the midst of a dangerous dance
In your arms, I got nowhere to run
I don't stand a chance

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
And a flame starts to rise igniting what used to be
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
Happens every time you're near, emotional

I remember the last time I let you in
I was burned by the flame, I can still feel the pain
And it scares me, it scares me to know I can still feel the same
As I felt the last time, I chose hearts over mind

All those memories rushing back to me
And I'm trembling with every embrace
Trying to hide those old feelings
That I thought time had erased

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
And a flame starts to rise igniting what used to be
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
It happens every time you're near, emotional

I know there's no escaping what I'm feeling inside
So just hold me tonight 'cause baby
This feeling's just too strong to fight

(When I look in your eyes)
I get so emotional
(Oh, I'm so emotional)
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
(Get so, I get so)
(Happens every time you're near, emotional)

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
(Oh, I'm so emotional)
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
(I get so emotional)
When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
(It seems to happen every time you're near, emotional)

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
