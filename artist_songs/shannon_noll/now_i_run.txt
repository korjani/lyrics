Tell me how the circle ends 
Theres no beginning 
Everything that came before 
Will come round again 
And I look in the mirror 
My fathers eyes look back at me 

He gave me a road to choose 
He gave me freedom 
And I pray Im strong enough 
To walk in his shoes 
And I hope that I become 
Half the man he'd want me to be 

Cos I feel you guiding me 
Showin me the way when Im misdirected 
I know your not here but I feel connected 

[Chorus]
Cos everything that I am 
Comes from a better man 
And all that Ive said and done 
Cant rewrite my history 
Right there for all to see 
Im just my fathers son 
Taught me to walk, now I run 
Now I run 

Sometimes when I lose myself 
In my weakness 
I can feel the touch of his 
Unmistakable hands 
And theyre pushing me forward 
Back into the circle again 

And I hope my son sees in me 
The kind of man that he was to me 

[Chorus]

And everything that I am 
comes from a better man 
And all that Ive said and Ive done 
Cant rewrite my history 
Right there for all to see 
Im just my fathers son 
Taught me to walk, now I run 
I run 

He's the best and the worst of me 
Sometimes I don't know where my common sense is 
I may be a sinner but my best defence is 

[Chorus]
