Sittin in a hotel miles from nowhere 
Thought that this would be my happiness 
I look at the phone and pick it up 
For the millionth time I put it down again 

I know I let you go 
And I've got no right to know 

[CHORUS] 
Do you ever get lonely baby 
Don't you ever get tired of living that way 
Don't you ever wonder whether there's a better life, 
out there yeah 
Do you ever think about what we had 
And how you'd give anything to get it back 
Do you ever think you'll never love that way again 

Wonder if and only 
Do you ever get lonely 

I look around the room and wonder 
When it was and how my life has changed 
I'm surrounded by a million so called friends 
And I don't even know their names 

When all of your love is gone 
And you you feel like you don't belong 
Oh tell me 

[CHORUS] 

I know that this world has changed us 
Now we're nothing more than strangers 
But do you think about me ever 
Do you think we belong together 

[CHORUS] 

Do you ever miss me 
wishing you could kiss me 
If only you could hold me 
Do you ever get lonely 
Like me....
