In...my...sensations
I believe that I...was
born with the things that I know
I want...to talk...
Like ev'ry
Before I decide what to do

And I fell all over and I
couldn't stand up
I can't be critical
I can't won't stop
Such a happy day
for me
Bring a happy day
to me
Send a happy day
to me
And a happy day
came to me come to me here it come...

I'm...only...looking
Feel like my heart
has a will of it's own
I feel...feel nice inside
right here
And now it's...summer again

The story that I told
The story I made up
I was foolin' around but I
can't won't stop
Such a happy day
for me
Bring a happy day
to me
Send a happy day
to me
And a happy day
come to me, come to me, here it come...

This...boy...is in motion
Some density
moved right beside me
I want
My sentence
Right here
But now I'm far away

A sign was given but
many years have passed
Cost a little bit to love you but I
won't can't stop
Such a happy day
for me
Bring a happy day
to me
Send a happy day
to me
And a happy day
came to me come to me here it come...
It's alright
