Electric guitar gets run over by a car on the highway
This is a crime against the state
This is the meaning of life.

To tune this electric guitar

An electric guitar is brought in to a court of law
The judge and the jury (twelve members of the jury)
All listening to records
This is a crime against the state
This is the verdict they reach:

Never listen to electric guitar

Electric guitar is copies, the copy sounds better
Call this the law of justice, call this freedom and liberty
I thought I perjure myself, right infront of the jury!
Is this a crime against the state? No!
This is the verdict they reach:
Someone controls electric guitar.
