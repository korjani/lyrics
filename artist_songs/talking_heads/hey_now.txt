I wanna bicycle
I wanna popsicle
I wanna space face
Buy me a cherry face now

Hey now!

I wanna video
I wanna rock and roll
Take me to the shopping mall
Buy me a rubber ball now

Hey now!
Hey now!

Every night sun goes down
And the people are staying at home
You can tell your momma & daddy
Leave those children alone

They know what they're doin'
They ain't runnin' away
Uncle John said, "Tell Aunt Mary
I got nothing to say"
(And she say:)

Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!

Ho---
Would the light come hitcha in the eye
Hey---
Gonna stop, gonna getcha by surprise!

I am the king of the world
The boss of the boys & girls
You can live till a 100 & 10
If you listen to what I said
