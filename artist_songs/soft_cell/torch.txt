I'm lost again and I'm on the run
Looking for love in a sad song
With your avenger eyes and your catlike ways I can hold you
You are a fool for me to be cruel
I'm leaning on this bar listening to you sing
And your sad song rings in my ears and I start to cry

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I hear the saxophone and it tears my soul
And we're feeling old, feeling so cold
She is the torch and she is the theme
She could be a dream but - oh boy - is she real
Try to avoid her eyes, to avoid her words
They will hit you with all that you feel

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind a way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

See her eyes they are bright tonight.
See the stars coming out tonight.
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight. 

See my eyes they are bright tonight.
See my hands reaching out tonight.
Hear my words they are dynamite
See how they light your way tonight

See her eyes they are bright tonight
See her eyes they are bright tonight
See how they light your way tonight
