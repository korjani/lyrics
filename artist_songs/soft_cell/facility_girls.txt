She's a secretary in the daytime 
A modern venus on the 8th floor 
She's a secretary in the daytime 
A bright young thing 
With a promising career 

She's got the abilities 
She's got the facilities 
She's got the abilities 
She's got the facilities 

She's a secretary in the daytime 
A model beauty 
At the typewriter 

She's a secretary in the daytime 
A smile for boss 
And she's doing fine 

She's got the abilities 
She's got the facilities 
She's got the abilities 
She's got the facilities 

She's a secretary in the daytime 
She's a secretary in the daytime 

She makes herself a drink and she climbs into bed, 
The sheets so clean and cool, 
It's so nice to rest her aching head, 
She thinks back on her working day, 
Her boss; the silly things he says, 
She smiles, she shuts her eyes, 
And she's dreaming of Terry, a mechanic, 
sometimes working 8 'til 10, 
It's so rare she ever sees him, 
And she wants so much to see him again, 
He bought her a ring and the flowers on her bedside table, 
And she knows that she loves him, but does he love her? 
She kisses the photo on the wall beside her bed, 
And tries to hold back a silly tear. 
She's a working girl now, and Mummy lives so far away, 
So She bites her lip, 
she knows that Terry will be calling soon one day. 

I look at the clock and I'm feeling the rhythm of love 
(It's going through me) 
I look at the light and it sends a lonely shiver down my spine 
(It gets right to me) 
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's arms, 
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's eyes, 
You're everything I like and everything I despise. 
(Why don't you leave me?) 
Running my fingers through your hair, 
Running your fingers down the back of my neck. 
Playing your games with your innocent eyes, 
I try hard to smile through all of your lies, 
That start to hurt me, hurt me

She found a message on her typewriter, 
(Like a page from true-love stories) 
It said that she was just a normal girl, (It's like a dream) 
They also felt she was a human being (like a dream) 
They said that she was a facility (A dream)

Dream, dream, dream, dream, 

Shhhhhhh, Goodnight
