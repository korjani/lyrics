Searching through the memory books
Of photographs your lovers took
Why play the game of place the pain
When you end up feeling just the same
Anyway...

Sleep comes so slowly now
So hard to keep the eyelids down
And you're hoping soon to drown the sound
Of a voice you know that whispers in
Your mind...

Oh, it was a sad, sad day
The day you turned away
And there was nothing in your eye
You had told me once you found it impossible
To cry...

I know you've been there and back
I've been there too
But it was never really deep in you
To do those things you had to do...

And in your sleepy bedroom eyes
I saw the signs
And I lay awake all night
In the cold
Until the light burned my side
And there was nothing
There was nothing anymore...

And there was nothing
Not a feeling
As you glanced back from the door...

Move away to find another place
That illustrates your point of view
Surrounded by the little things
That re-assure
That reflect you...

Ooooo and there was nothing
And there was nothing in my heart
And there was nothing in my head
The light in your eyes is changing all the time
And I still have your smile
Burned into my mind...
