I'm all out of love
Have I given too much
I'm all out of love
Because there's never enough
I'm all out of love
Have I given too much
I'm all out of love

Drawing up all my years
I'm trying to feel something
Calling on my lost tears
Just trying to feel
Summoning all my passion
Some place I've long forgotten
My anxieties magnify
Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love
There's never enough
I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love
Have I given too much
I'm all out of love

So many doubts
So many fears
All those demons that rise
With the years
Love came calling
But the cupboard was bare
I try to find my heart
But it wasn't there
Am I a spent force?
Used up?
Washed up?
Left out to dry?
Is it the same for everybody
Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love
There's never enough
I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love
Have I given too much
I'm all out of love

When regret comes to call
It's a fear that visits us all
Any love that's left is mine
To keep me warm
For what's left of my time
As the final act approaches
If I could I'd sit and cry
But I'm drained of all emotion
Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love
There's never enough
I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love
Have I given too much
I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love
I've given too much
I'm all out of love
Never enough
I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love
All out of love
There is nothing left
I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love
