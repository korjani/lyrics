Fr..fr...fr...frustration!
Frustration
Frustration

I have life
Ordinary wife
I have car
A favourite bar
I have job
A moderate wage
I get the pains
That come with age

I am so ordinary

I have child
She goes wild
I have home
A mortgage of my own
I have hobby
But it's nothing very special
I do the garden
I watch girls

I am so ordinary

I have life
I have cage
I'm going bald
I want to tell the world
I've done nothing
I've achieved nothing
I work for a firm
But I want to burn it down, down

I am so ordinary
I am so ordinary

I was born
One day I'll die
There was something in between
I, I don't know what
Or why
I'm a man
I want to break a rule
I am a no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody
Everybody's fool
I am so ordinary

Frustration [x4]
I'm so tired of endless art
Love stories
I'm beginning to not give a damn
I wish I could reach right out for the untouchable
Film starring Bruce, John Wayne, Elvis Presley
Experiment with cocaine, LSD and set a bad bad example
Live a little, run a harem, be a tiger
Meet Bo Derek and be her Tarzan
Reach, reach out out
Live, live, live
Die, die, die
I, I, I, I wanna die...

Frustration, oh
Frustration [x3]
I wanna die
I wanna die, die, die, die
die, die, d..d..d..die, die, die
Frustration
I wanna die
