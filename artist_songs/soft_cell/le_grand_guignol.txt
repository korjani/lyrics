Would you like to taste a little pain
From the fickle hand of fame
Aren't you happy that the road to success
Is littered with drugs and sex
It's all here for your delectation
In compromising situations
Let fallen heroes entertain you
Take a look
Nobody's gonna blame you

Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, to the broken people
The broken people

Snake dancers, sex changer
Come inside
It gets stranger and stranger
Got a lot of unpleasant surprises
Cruelty comes in all shapes and sizes

Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, to the broken people
The broken people
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, to the broken people
The broken people

It's Grand Guignol
It's rock 'n' roll
It's vaudeville and burlesque
All of human life is here
In the theatre of the grotesque

The city has turned upside down
The circus lion is eating the clown
We're all delivered to the poison pens
And sacrificed to the pig with the lens

Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, to the broken people
The broken people
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, le Grand Guignol
Say hello, to the broken people
The broken people

It's Grand Guignol
It's rock 'n' roll
It's vaudeville and burlesque
All of human life is here
In the theatre of the grotesque
