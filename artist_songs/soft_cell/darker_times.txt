These darker times
Where do we go from here?
Living for trivial information
It's a hopeless situation
Blinded by lies
False Gods and fake religions
Ulterior motives and bad intentions
Nobody knows what waits round the corner
We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times

These darker times
Why has it come to this
Urban decay and revolution
Suicide is the only solution
Am I being unrealistic
To feel so nihilistic
Don't judge the stage of my mind
'Cos brother we're two of a kind

We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times

We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times

Each night twisting
Turning in my bed
I'm trying to make sense of it all
Is it all in my head?

These darker times
Who shall I talk to now
Nothing going on in your eyes
Only the darkness in your eyes
It's a soulless situation
It's a spiritual vacation
Turn on the TV
Pass the remote
Turn off the light
And abandon all hope

We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times

We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times

We gotta keep dancing
Through the years
We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears
Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times
