We've hit those depths again
Playing black games again
Black mellow lies
And the narrowing of eyes
Playing those games again
You hold the reins again
But then I turned the card
And you know I hit hard

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

Shaking your head that way
It's so true when they say
That love is a pain in the heart
A pain that pulls apart
I'm breaking rules again
You're breaking hearts again
Pretend to despise
When there's love in your eyes

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

And I'm loving you
And you're hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the other side of love
