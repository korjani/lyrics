Another day melts into the evening
I sit alone and watch the stars
Remembering times
I think of the past

Here in my isolation
In the solitary situation
Reality hurts
Where memories last

When you whisper my name in the silence
You stop my heart with a touch of violence
We'll always be
Together alone

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone

You share in my deepest secrets
You're here in my darkest moment
Together alone
Together alone

You know what I'm always thinking
You lift my mood when I'm sinking
Together alone
Together alone

When you're here in my arms
I'm dreaming of you
Life will end when I stop
Believing in you
Together alone
Together alone

You're like a shadow
At the edge of my eye
Like a chill in the air
Like a light in the sky
Like the endless peace after we die

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone

I don't need anybody
I don't want anybody
I'm on my own
Together alone

Nobody can understand us
Nobody to make demands on us
Together alone
Together alone

And as the bombs are falling
I hear a voice that's calling
Together alone
Together alone

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone

Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
Together alone
Together alone

You're deep in my heart now
You're deep in my soul now
Together alone
Forever alone

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone
Together alone
Forever alone
Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
Together alone
Forever alone
Together alone
Together alone
Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
