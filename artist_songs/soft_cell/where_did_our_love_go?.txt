Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Oh, don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more
I've got this burning, yearning yearning feeling inside me
Oh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my life
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
And now that I've surrendered
So helplessly
You know I believe
You want to leave me

Oh, baby baby
Where did our love go
Oh, don't you leave me
Oh, baby baby
Where did our love go?
Oh don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more

You came into my life
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
And now that I've surrendered
So helplessly
You know I believe
You want to leave me

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Oh, baby baby
Don't you leave me no more
I've got this burning, burning yearning feeling inside me
Deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more
And now that I've surrendered so helplessly
You know, I believe you want to leave me

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
