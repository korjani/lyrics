I'm having a mid-life crisis
Behaving in strange ways
Wandering around the supermarket
In a daze
I try to fill my head
With positive thoughts
Try to get a rush
From the merchandise I bought

Out of my head
Out of my head
Where do we go
When the feelings are dead

Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you

I tried meditation
Crystal therapy
Colonic irrigation
Didn't agree with me
Road rage and new age
Just tricks of the mind
The onset of middle age
Is all that I find

Out of my head
Out of my head
Where do we go
When the feelings are dead

Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you

Whatever whatever whatever...
Whatever whatever whatever

Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes
To get me through
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes
To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes
When only you will do

I'm having a mid life crisis
Help me
I'm having a mid life crisis
Help me
Pour me a drink
Chop me a line
Roll me a joint
