You in the clouds over there

Hanging on with a wing and a prayer

Forget your regrets and forgiving

Life is not for lasting but living

Don't be one of those lonely people

Waiting for a bus that never comes

Even little dreams are aspirations
Out run your limitations

I don't want to leave you

With a cloud over your head
Take some time to reassess

And think of what I've said

On an up

On an up

I'm gonna leave you on an up

On an up

On an up

I'm gonna leave you on an up

I'm gonna try and leave you on an up
Not to cry

And leave you on an up

I don't blame you
If you believe there's no beauty in the world

But if you take some time to look

You'll find it there for sure

Too much cynicism

Ridicule and vile derision

But if you're guilty then I am too

For seeing life through shades of blue


Don't want to leave your head

Full of dirty streets and falling rain

I want to leave you with a little sun

Here it comes again

On an up

On an up

I'm gonna leave you on an up

On an up

On an up

I'm gonna leave you on an up
I'm gonna try and leave you on an up

Not to cry

And leave you on an up

You in the clouds over there

Hanging on with a wing and a prayer

We're all part of the same plan

Trying to get through life the best we can

On an up

On an up
I'm gonna leave you on an up

On an up

On an up

I'm gonna leave you on an up

I'm gonna try and leave you on an up

And leave you on an up
Not to cry
On an up
