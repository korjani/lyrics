I'll do anything
Anything at all
Just throw a little cash
In my direction
I'll sing anything
From rock to music hall
Just for a morsel of
Your attention
Maybe as a child
I wasn't given
All the love I needed
Maybe I'm a sad
Reflection of today

I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
Desperate for love
Any kind of love
Or attention

Don't have to tempt me
You won't see me resisting
See me in a magazine
Or I'm not existing
I'll parody myself
Just don't leave me on the shelf
Maybe I'm a symptom
Of a bigger problem

I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
Desperate for love
Any kind of love
Or attention

I'm always available
Without hesitation
Opening an envelope?
Just send an invitation
I'll dance for you
Pose for you
Take off all my clothes for you
Speak your words
Sing your song
I'm up for auction
Going gone!

I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
Desperate for love
Any kind of love
Or attention
Any kind of love
Or attention
Any kind of love
Or attention
