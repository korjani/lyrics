Suddenly last summer
I started going out of my head
In a tiny hotel room
Lying naked on a bed
I knew what you were doing
And I knew what you'd done
Your life with me was ending
Your new life had begun

But I was cursing your name
And I was cursing that room
And I was praying for the strength to stop loving you

I started writing you the letter
Which turned into the book
I was gonna reach across the ocean
And force you to look

But what kind of man was I?
Who would sacrify you happiness to satisfy his pride
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind

Then you came back to me 
And I went down on one knee
With a glint in my eyes 
And a rose between my teeth
And I pushed out my tongue for you to see
That I'd been dying of a thirst for your company
Then you quenched my loneliness with your tears
And our clothes fell away as we rolled back the years
But we couldn't deny it because we could not admit it

If our love was too strong to die
Or we were just too weak to kill it
Was our love too strong to die?
Or were we just too weak to kill it?

Every moment in that room
I closed my eyes in prayer
Every moment I awoke
I clenched my teeth in prayer

What kind of man was I?
Who would sacrify your happiness to satisfy his pride
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind

Who could delay your destiny to appease his aching swollen pride
Who could delay your destiny to appease his screaming little mind

You're mine
