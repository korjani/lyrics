You're floating down a tunnel
In a little wooden box
You're cold and your lonely and enveloped in fog
You've been pried open and left here to die
You should have trusted your instincts
'cause they don't tell lies

Something always goes wrong when things are going right
You swallowed your pride
To quell the pain inside
Someone captured your heart
Like a thief in the night
And squeezed all the juice out until it ran dry

You've been read like an open book
Page by page
You'll never tell anyone your inner thoughts again
You were taken in
By a heart of fools gold
Now you're drifting in circles
In the depths of your soul

Something always goes wrong when things are going right
You swallowed your pride
To quell the pain inside
Someone captured your heart
Like a thief in the night
And squeezed all juice out until it ran dry
