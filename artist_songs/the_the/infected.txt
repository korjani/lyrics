I've got too much energy to switch off my mind,
but not enough to get myself organized.
My heart is heavy - my head is confused,
And my aching little soul - has started burning blue!

[Chorus:]
I can't give you up, till I've got more than enough.
So infect me with your love -
Nurse me into sickness. Nurse me back to health.
Endow me with the gifts - of the man made world.

When desire becomes an illness instead of a joy,
And guilt a necessity that's gotta be destroyed.

[Chorus]

Take me by the hands and walk me to the end of the pier.
Run your fingers through my hair,
and tell me what I wanna hear -
Will lies become truths in this face of fading youth
from my scrotum to your womb, - your cradle to my tomb.

[Chorus]

Nurse me into sickness, nurse me back to health
And tell me what it is that I want in this world!!
