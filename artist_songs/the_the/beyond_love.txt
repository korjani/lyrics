Move away from the window and into the light
There are some things in this life that you just can't fight
It's as if the spirits above have cast a little spell upon us
It's as if heaven above is beckoning us
So let us take off our crosses and lay them in a tin
And let our weakness become virtue instead of sin
Our bodies stand naked as the day they were born
And tremble like animals before a coming storm

Take me beyond love
Up to something above
Upon this bed, between these sheets
Take me to a happiness beyond human reach

The force of life is rushing through our veins
In and out like the tide it comes in waves
The drops of semen and the clots of blood
Which may, one day, become like us
With outstretched hands reaching beyond love
And up to something above

Before our juices run cold and our flesh grows old
Let me feed upon your breast and draw closer to your soul
Let me stay with you tonight and I'll offer you my world
I'll take you to the angels if you'll take me to myself

Take me beyond love
Up to something above
Upon this bed, between these sheets
Take me to a happiness beyond human reach

Beyond the grasp of lust
Beyond the need for trust
Beyond the gaze of the sick and the lame
Beyond the stench of human pain
