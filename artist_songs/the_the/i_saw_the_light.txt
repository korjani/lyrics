I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man, I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
