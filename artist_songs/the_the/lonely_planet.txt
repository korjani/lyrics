Planet Earth is slowing down
Overseas, underground
Wherever you look around
Lord, take me by the hand
lead me through these desert sands
To the shores of a promised land.

You make me start when you look into my heart
And see me for who I really am.

If you can't change the world. Change yourself.
If you can't change the world. Change yourself.

I didn't care if the sun didn't shine
& the rain didn't fall from the sky
I just cared about myself
From this world to the next
And from the next back to this.
By our actions we are bound.
We're running out of love
running out of hate
running out of space for the human race.
Planet Earth is slowing down.

You make me cry when you look into my eyes.
And see me for who I really am.

If you can't change the world. Change yourself.
If you can't change the world. Change yourself.
And if you can't change yourself...change the world.

I'm in love with the planet I'm standing on
I can't stop
I can't stop thinking of
All the people I've ever loved
All the people I have lost
All the people I'll never know
All the feelings I've never shown.
The world's too big. And life's too short.
To be alone...To be alone.
