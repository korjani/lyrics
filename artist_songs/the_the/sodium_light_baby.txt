As I sat in the back of that old taxi cab.
waitin' for the evening to come.
On every street of this city
I heard you call my name.

You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.
You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.

From the day that we are born
Until the day we die
We are hostage to our hearts' desire.
And though I ride this city
I can't escape from you.
And when I look up to the stars I wonder
Can the world really be so cruel?

You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.
You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.

Tonight the wolves are howling
I can't escape from you.
A yearning past denying
I will surrender to.

You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.
You're the strangest feeling I ever had.
The strangest feeling.

Shine on me. Sodium light baby. [x4]
