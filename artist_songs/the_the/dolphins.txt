Some times I think about
Saturday's child
And all about the times
When we were running wild

I've been a searching for the dolphins
In the sea
Oh, but sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?

This old world will never change
The way it's been
And all our ways of war
Can't change it back again

I've been a searching for the dolphins
In the sea
Oh, but sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?

Lord, I'm not the one to tell
This old world how to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all I hate is gone

I've been a searching for the dolphins
In the sea
Oh, but sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?

This old world will never change
This old world will never change
This old world will never change
