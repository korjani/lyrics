I don't wanna go anymore 
I don't wanna go anymore 
Stop pushing me through the door 
I don't wanna go anymore 
Anymore, anymore, anymore 

I don't wanna fight anymore 
I don't wanna fight anymore 
Picking myself off the floor 
I don't wanna fight anymore 
Anymore, anymore, anymore 

I said I'd try but you don't believe me 
You still don't know who I am, if only 
I had the guts to tell you 
If I had the guts to tell you 

If... If... If...
