Well I don't want to make things bad 
But these last few weeks are the worst I've had 
And that's really sad, it's really sad, you know - woah! 

Because I knew what we were gonna say 
And I didn't want it to end that way 
Like on a winters day, but that's okay 
Because I've got my tracksuit ready on 

Don't give me your friends 
Yeah they're driving me round the bend 
I just wanted some time alone 
So we could sort this thing out, lifes a rolling stone 

So I'll take you for an elephant ride 
And I'll show you things that I feel inside 
Yeah that's what I'll do, cos I like you 
And I don't wanna let things slide 

Aaaaahhhhhhh....... 

So I hope everything's alright 
Because I know I won't see you tonight 
I just turn out the light and fall asleep 
Without a peep 

And when I wake up with my tracksuit on 
Well then I'll know that you've been away too long 
So I'll play a song, I'll play a song 
And I'll dedicate it just for you 

Can we still be friends 
Yeah that's all that we've got in the end 
But I've been secretly holding out 
That some day you will say you want more than that 

So I'll take you for an elephant ride 
And I'll show you things that I feel inside 
Yeah that's what I'll do, cos I like you 
And I don't wanna let things slide
