There is the mat 
Wipe where it's at 
You can come in 
So can the cat 
I can see me 
Under my feet 
Under a fan 
Spreading the heat 

If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah 
Then come along Friday what is there to do? 
We like to clean, our hands with preen 
To keep all the germs away from the scene 
That's our motto, that's what we say 
That is the truth, that's how it'll stay 
If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah 
Then come along Friday what is there to do? 

Scrub and make clean the lino, lino 
In case of visitors 
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean 
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean, it's hard to clean 

There is the mat 
Wipe where it's at 
You can come in 
So can the cat 
I can see me 
Under my feet 
Under a fan 
Spreading the heat 

If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah 
Then come along Friday what is there to do? 
Scrub and make clean the lino, lino

Like what you get when you've just started retarded 
Think of what you want and who you are 
M, m, m, My life, when I think is so circumstancial 
You take what you're given it's never substancial 
But that doesn't matter, when I am around her 
I think of something more, but what will I use it for 

You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean, hard to clean 
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean 
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean 
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go 
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean 
Hard to clean 
Can you tell me what I mean
