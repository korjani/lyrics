Well I've been outside and it's not my scene 
And I know you don't know what I mean 
But I'm trying hard, cos I've never been 
On the other side, of a day dream 

La da di da da... 

And I've been around, tried to be kind 
But it gets me down, when I often find 
People that I meet, in this state of mine 
Hanging onto threads, falling behind 

La da di da da... 

Seems I've found, 
Something to stick around my neck and be proud 
Seems I know, 
Somethings will never go with what you've got on show 
Even so... 

La da di da da...
