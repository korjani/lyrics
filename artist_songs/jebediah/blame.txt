I was strolling down your road 
When I saw you now I know 
It's clear, it's all your fault dear 
And the price I had to pay 
Shit that I took everyday 
I lived was all that you could give 

And I know that you're to blame [x 6]

I've been fighting it so long 
But I know that I'm not wrong 
With this, I'm totally pissed 
So I'll take it out on you 
And all your girlfriends too 
Cause they hate me but they're too blind to see 

And I know that you're to blame [x 6] 

Sssah.... 

And I know that you're to blame [x 6]
It'll never be the same
