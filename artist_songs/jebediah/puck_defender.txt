[Verse 1:]

You and me tie ourselves on to the railway 
Tugging on things that catch us up 
Sitting off things that fly us down the freeway 
Blowing our brew from plastic cups 

[Chorus:]

Nothing to do, (when you're) in this situation 
The pilots are drunk, we're all dead 
Proving we're worth, the casual observation 
Proving we're worth the food we're fed 
And I'm hurking up the pieces 
All the pieces that I've found 
And I'm picking up the pieces 
Off the ground, Yeah 

[Verse 2:]

You and me fall down onto the wrong side 
Laughing at those that pushed us down 
Climbing back up, we enjoy the free ride 
Climbing back up but they've all gone 

[Chorus]

[Repeat Verse 1 and Chorus]
