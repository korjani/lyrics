[Verse 1:]
Hey Bosco, what did you do 
To make so many men hate you 
You think you're right, they say you're wrong 
They've been hassling you for way too long 

[Chorus:]
Going out it made you a star 
Going out but going too far 
Going out expressing your point of view 

[Verse 2:]
Hey Bosco, what did you do 
To make so many cops want you 
They think they're right; you say they're wrong 
They've been hassling you for way too long 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
(Point of view) 
Well I don't want to fake it 
And I know you're gonna make it 
But you don't have to take it all...
