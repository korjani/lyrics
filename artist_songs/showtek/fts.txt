Freaks on E, that's what we fuck man!

Ey yo, 1-2 , 1-2 - yo, hehe!

This is what I love, and can't stop loving.
Get wasted at parties, from 9 'till 7 in the morning.
I live for the music, rolling blunts, feeling high, getting loaded or take some pills and go to La La Land.
Spending all my money on dope and extreme high priced tickets.
But in the end it's all worth it.
I like to live in my own world. Fuck regular life, fuck a 9 to 5 job.
I'm told to enjoy every moment, every hour, every minute.
That's what I do on Fridays and Saturdays. Why should I take life so seriously?
I just wanna do what I like to do. Being far from reality, cause I can't stand society.
This is my own world, I just wanna hear the music.

I think the whole system fucking sucks.
Everybody is working their fucking ass off during the week,
getting totally fucking stressed out
So what's wrong, and what's right?
I live for the weekend, I live for hard styles, I live for hardstyle baby!

Come on! Let's go!
