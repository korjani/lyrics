Too many times they did me wrong
But I know what I deserve
Too many times got strung along
But I know what I deserve

Now you walk my way, made me to smile
Made my day, made it worth my while
For once I swear, I know my words
I know you care, know what I deserve

A lover like you 
A lover like you
A lover like you
A lover like you

Too many time I played the fool
But I know what I deserve
Deep down I hurt but played it cool
But I know what I deserve
Too many times my love was blind
But I know what I deserve
I never knew I could be kind
No I know what I deserve

Now you walk my way, made me to smile
Made my day, made it worth my while
For once I swear, I know my words
I know you care, know what I deserve

A lover like you 
A lover like you
A lover like you
A lover like you

[x4]
Say my name, say my name
I can hear you calling baby
Say the words, say the words
Can you feel me falling down

A lover like you [x4]

Too many times I played the fool
I need a lover like you
Like you, like you
