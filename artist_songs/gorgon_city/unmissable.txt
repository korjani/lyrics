When I'm looking in your eyes
I'm not sure if you're still with me
What is it that's on your mind?
You went wrong, are you sure that you miss me?

[Pre-Chorus:]
'Cause it's been a long time coming
We traveled down a long road to be here
It doesn't make no sense that we're running
When it's time to face all our fears

[Chorus:]
The sun's gonna shine for the last time
And I don't wanna miss it all
We made it this far, stay in my heart
Let's make it unmissable
Whoa, let's make it unmissable
Make it unmissable
Whoa, let's make it unmissable
Make it unmissable

Put me out my misery
On another cold night in December
From now let's make some memories
Let us make something to remember

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You and me have come this far
Let's not miss the best part
The truth descending from afar
Don't give up at the best part

[Chorus]

Whoa, let's make it unmissable
Make it unmissable
Whoa, let's make it unmissable
Make it unmissable
