Give me what I want
And I'll give you what you need
Don't play with my emotions baby
I'm another breed
Don't wanna lose this feeling so don't burn it out
I wanna keep on living in the moment now
I'm pulling you tight
And I might not let you leave
So give me your devotion
And in the night I'll set you free
Don't wanna lose control until the lights go out
Just me and you
Let's get into the moment now

Here in your arms
I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on dancing

Just keep on dancing...

Give in in my heart
And you'll finally make me see
Between every misfortune there's a fortune in between
Don't wanna lose this feeling so don't burn it out
I wanna keep on living in the moment now

I'm ready for your love
Don't hold it back on me
Just give me your emotion baby that's all that I need

Don't wanna lose control until the lights go out
Just me and you
Let's get into the moment now

Here in your arms
I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on...

Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your devotion
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your heart
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your devotion
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your heart

Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your devotion
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your heart
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your devotion
Don't stop
Give me all
Give me all your heart

Here in your arms
I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on...

Here in your arms
I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
Just keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
Just keep on dancing
