If I could go back in time
Give you every piece of my heart
I promise, girl I give you all of my love
I can't give up, no I won't
Stopping by 'til you come back home
You just gotta believe me, baby

They say that you don't know
What you got until it's gone
Is it too late for me to try to
Clean up the mess that I made?
I never thought that I'd be the one left hurting
I got hurt from playing my games
I try my hardest baby, just to prove you're worth it
Please just tell me that you'll take me back

Tell me what to do, babe
Tell me what to do cause I don't wanna waste no time
I just wanna make you mine again
Girl, I know
I never should've made you cry
Never should've left your side

They say that you don't know
What you got until it's gone
Is it too late for me to try to
Clean up the mess that I made?
I never thought that I'd be the one left hurting
I got hurt from playing my games
I try my hardest baby, just to prove you're worth it
Please just tell me that you'll take me back

They say that you don't know
What you got until it's gone
Is it too late for me to try to
Clean up the mess that I made?
I never thought that I'd be the one left hurting
I got hurt from playing my games
I try my hardest baby, just to prove you're worth it
Please just tell me that you'll take me back
