[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
[Snoop Dogg:]
Ain't no party like a West Coast party
'Cause a West Coast party don't stop

[Faith Evans:]
When we party on the West Coast (on the West Coast)
Drinkin' and smokin' all night, all night long
We keep it funky on the West Coast
(They gon' keep it funky on the West Side)
I got love for my people on the West Coast, yeah

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
When the la-la hits ya, lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
[Snoop Dogg:]
The maze is a daze, I blaze, I will amaze
Smokin' while you're loccin' with some California A's
Me and B.I.G., what it is, get it in
Sippin' gin with the Hen in the alleyway
Bangin' the Cali way
[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
[Snoop Dogg:]
S-N-double O-P, big D-O
Old school nigga, '84 El Camino
LBC know, we love Biggie though
I.E.Y. in even Bernadino

[Faith Evans:]
When we party on the West Coast (on the West Coast)
Drinkin' and smokin' all night, all night long
We keep it funky on the West Coast
(They gon' keep it funky on the West Side)
I got love for my people on the West Coast, yeah

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
[Snoop Dogg:]
Y'all know I'm from the West, I'm the king to be exact
You better holla at me when you need that chronic sack
I got it all, one call, no stall, on the ball
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Listen to me, holla at ya dogg
Words of the clever, forever multiply
Birds of a feather, preparin' 'em to fly
Perfection, selection
This is a B.I.G. D.P.G.C. connection
[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues, what it do!

[Faith Evans:]
When we party on the West Coast (on the West Coast)
Drinkin' and smokin' all night, all night long
(We be drinkin' and smokin' all night)
We keep it funky on the West Coast
(We gon' keep it funky on the West Side)
I got love for my people on the West Coast, yeah

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Spend about a week, on Venice Beach
Y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
[Snoop Dogg:]
Ain't no party like a West Coast party
'Cause a West Coast party don't stop

[Faith Evans:]
When we party on the West Coast (on the West Coast)
Drinkin' and smokin' all night, all night long

[Snoop Dogg:]
Ain't no party like a West Coast party
'Cause a West Coast party don't stop

[Faith Evans:]
Don't you wanna ride with me?
Don't you wanna ride?
People come and ride with me
To the West Side
Party, on the West Coast
Don't you wanna ride with me?
Don't you wanna ride?
People come and ride with me
To the West Side
Party, on the West Coast
