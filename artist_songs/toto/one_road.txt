Time
Is the enemy of a young man's dreams
And I'm stranded
In the heartland, or so it seems

I'm hitching a ride for a chance at the good life
I'll have my own place out on fifth avenue
I'm leaving this time gonna walk on that fine line
I'll be the first one who finally breaks through

One road to the promised land
I have to get there any way I can
One road to the promised land
I'm gonna find out just who I am

Freedom
Do you know what I mean
Flat lands
Are all I've ever seen

Stuck in a small town where you live, then you die
Ain't nothing but fool's working nine until five
I'll sleep in the subways 'till I get what I need
I'm not gonna stay here, just lie here and bleed

One road to the promised land
I'm gonna get there any way I can
One road to the promised land
Show the world just who I am

[Instrumental break]

One road to the promised land
I'm gonna get there any way - any way I can
One road to the promised land
I have to find out just who I am

One road to the promised land
I thought by now I'd be a different man
One road to the promised land
Maybe I'll find out just who I am
