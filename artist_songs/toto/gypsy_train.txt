Downtown Jimmy
Say you're feelin' kinda blue
It's no problem
This is whatcha gotta do
Telephone your baby
Tell her that you're workin' late
Come and pay a visit
Please don't hesitate

Come join the party
Come along and be our guest
Sit back and let us do the rest
We're the best, yeah

Come on an' meet me at the station
Don't pack your bags
Just fix your hair
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta get out
Just look for me
I'm always there

Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
All aboard
Now don't you be afraid
Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
Feed the fire
Let's go one mo' time again

Medication
Little love and sympathy
Cool libation
It's complimentary
Play a little poker
Love when the stakes are high
Lotta nasty women
Givin' everyone the eye

Say downtown Jimmy
Tell me whatcha need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Guaranteed, yeah

It's a perfect situation
It's so nice to have you here
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta pull out
Happy shiny people everywhere

Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
All aboard
Now don't you be afraid
Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
Feed the fire
Let's go one mo' time again

[Instrumental break]

It's a perfect situation
It's so nice to have you here
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta put out
Happy shiny people everywhere

Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
All aboard
Now don't you be afraid
Come on let's ride
Ride that gypsy train
Feed the fire
Let's go one mo' time again
