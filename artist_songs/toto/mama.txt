Mama, I don't love you anymore
Money's got me crawlin' on the floor
Lover, I'm so ashamed that I must go
Funny somehow I thought by now you'd know

Girl you'd better take my hand
And say what you mean to say
(And she said)
"Stay as long as you can
But don't wait till you're thrown away." 

Mama, please throw me out in the cold
Woman, the love you bought was never sold

Girl you'd better take my hand
And say what you mean to say
(And she said)
"Stay as long as you can
But don't wait till you're thrown away." 

Mama, I don't love you anymore
Sorry I'm not the boy you're looking for

(See the girl with they eyes on fire
Now he know she's the one he desires)
