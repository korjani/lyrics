Don't look now
You better watch that sword that's hanging over you
It's a long hard road and they will spit you out
When they get through with you

Don't hang your head
So the wise man said
Or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run 

There's no more time for living out your life
Yur sky is falling down
Don't close your eyes or make a wish on three
'Cause they will still be 'round

Don't hang your head
So the wise man said
Or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run 

[Instrumental break]

Don't hang your head
So the wise man said
Or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela-uela run
You better run, run Manuela-uela run
(gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela run
You better run, run Manuela run
(gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)
You better run, run Manuela run
