Don't know quite what to say
Haven't seen you in seven ages
Can you tell that it's me
Or is my picture on torn out pages?

And you think it's real
But it's just another future deal
And you know you're right
'Cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself
Sitting on a little shelf

Don't know quite what to do
I've been acting my life in phases
Is it really true
That they're keeping us locked in cages?

And you think it's real
But it's just another future deal
And you know you're right
'Cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself
Sitting on a little shelf

[Instrumental break]

And you think it's real
But it's just another future deal
And you know you're right
'Cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself
Sitting on a little shelf
