Out of the darkness
A light appears
Better angels fly

Moments of redemption
Between you and I
Over and over and again

We all just have to bend

So many hard lines
Are flexible
What would it give to take
Only need a moment
For it to snap and break
Brother or lover or a friend

We all just need to bend

'Cause if it breaks
We lose the power to learn from our mistakes
But if it bends
Then you and I can try to make amends
As better friends

It's almost over
We're older now
Better angels stay

Searching for an answer
And then it comes to me
Over and over and again

We'll all just have to bend
