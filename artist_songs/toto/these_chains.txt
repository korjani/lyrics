Everybody keeps talkin' about you
I can't lie anymore
Been too long
What went wrong? 
It's a mystery
Why you ever walked out that door
What direction should I go? 
Girl what's next for me
I don't know

Is it gonna get easier 
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Ohhh ohhh
Does it ever get easier
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Ohhh ohhh

I see your face 
When I look in the mirror
I feel your touch 
But you're not there
Wakin' up
Had enough of this dream of mine
Girl this just isn't fair
What direction should I go? 
Girl what's next for me
I don't know

Is it gonna get easier 
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Ohhh ohhh
Does it ever get easier
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Ohhh ohhh


[Bridge:]
Day by day
Until they break
Ohhh ohhh

Is it gonna get easier 
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Ohhh ohhh
Does it ever get easier
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Ohhh ohhh
[repeats out]
