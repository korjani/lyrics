There's something I must say 
Something I must do 
I planned it all this way 
Designed it just for you 
Do you wanna be with me 
Be with me at all? 
Do you have to be so cool 
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew 

[Chorus:]
I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love 
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough 

Can we go on this way? 
There's nothing left to proof 
It's not another game 
Or another simple move 
Do you believe in me 
Believe in me at all? 
Are you telling me the truth?
Or is it just imagination or the perfect dream 
That I'm here with you 

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Do you wanna be with me 
Be with me at all?
Do you have to be so cool 
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew 

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love 
I'm giving you the only heart I have 
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough 

I'm really mad about you 
There's nothing bad about our love 
I never had a broken heart before 
But I know you'll never tear 
Tear mine apart
