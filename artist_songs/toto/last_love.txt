What would you say
If I asked you to stay with me forever
But forever's in too soon
The touch of your hand
And the look in your eyes
Are the only things I know
I know that are true

We only have this life
To forgive and then forget
But the only thing that matters
Is we have no regrets

[Chorus:]
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you
There's nothing I wouldn't give to you
I know that you know it's true
Oh can't you see
You're the last love for me

Time passes fast
And the hours go quickly
But the fire inside our hearts
It never dies
The sound of your voice
And the way that it moves me in a special way
I can't describe

Please take my hand
And we'll walk the endless road
No one has to lead us
'Cause we know which way to go

[Chorus]

And if I ever really hurt you
How sorry I would be
There's something I've been trying to tell you
Darling it's time you know
You'll always be a part of me 

[Instrumental break]

Please take my hand
And we'll walk the endless road
No one has to lead us
'Cause we know which way to go

[Chorus]

I know that you know it's true
Oh can't you see
It's meant to be
You're the last love for me
