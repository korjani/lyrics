Watching 
Driving through the night 
I'm all alone 
Empty
Endless road
A thousand miles to go 
Midnight 
Five million thoughts 
Passing in a row 
Will you 
Still be waiting there? 
God only knows

I can still see your face in my mind 
With every turn I take 
And the wind through my heart feels so cold 
As it calls out your name 

[Chorus:]
Melanie 
Nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me
Melanie
Reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free

Morning
Sun's in my eyes
I'm tied to your soul
One chance 
One solitary life 
How could I let you go?

Got a phonecall or was it a dream
A voice spoke to me 
I could swear it was you that I heard 
Crying desperately 

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

I can still see your face in my mind 
With every turn I take 
And the wind through my heart feels so cold
As it calls out your name 

[Repeat chorus two times]
