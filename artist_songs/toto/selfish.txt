Ashes to ashes
That's how it ends
You go from heartache to heartache
As you make amends
Just bigger and bigger
You take two steps back
You want something from nothing
And you're so exact 

You think you're a rich man
Now you misbehave
You're not a free man running
Just a comfortable slave 

[Chorus:]
So selfish
You got more than you can use
But you still don't see
You're so selfish
And you're running out of room 

Deeper and deeper
As you forge ahead
You go higher and higher
But you've been mislead
Harder and harder
You grind the stone
Faster faster faster
Till you're skin and bones 

Too much ambition
Without relief
You know that ain't heaven
But it's what you teach 

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Who's got the answer
Give me the cure
Don't rush to judgement
Until you're sure

[Repeat chorus two times]
