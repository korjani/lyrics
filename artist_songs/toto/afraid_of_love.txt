You stole my heart the moment you came to town
I said hello but you were gone when I turned around
You can't get away, can't get away, even if you try now
I wanna tell you but the words just can't be found

I like the way you move and just the way you are
I can't take anymore, 'cause girl, you're pushing too hard
You can't get away, can't let you go, what's a boy to do now
You got me asking myself how I survived this far

I gotta get away from you, girl

[Chorus:]
'Cause I've never been afraid of love 'till I met you
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do
Never been afraid of love 'till I met you
Ooh, yes you say

[Instrumental break]

I'll give you something that you never ever had
When I start to think about you, it makes me laugh
You took me by surprise, I saw it in your eyes, I never had a chance, girl
Now that I see what you are, it doesn't hurt so bad

[Repeat chorus]
