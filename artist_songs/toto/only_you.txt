Waiting for you again
Seems like this never ends
I close my eyes and I see your face
And I see it all fading away

Woke up before you again
You're still asleep I can't pretend
I feel like I'm losing you
And I am trying to make everything right

Only you
Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh

If I could have a second chance
Maybe change the circumstance
Imagine if the dream came true
We could start it all over tonight

Only you
Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh
[repeats 2x]

Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand
Whoa no oh oh
