I got your letter stating I'm the only one
Are you forgetting all the damage that I've done
Are you waiting, contemplating why you changed your mind
Can't push my luck, good ones are getting hard to find

I'm wond'ring now if everything will be the same
I feel so empty knowing I'm the one to blame
And all along I never thought I stood a chance
Those lonely hours, mem'ries of you did enhance

[Chorus:]
Deep in the night when I need you so
You are the light, I can't let you go
You've been the one from the very start
You've got the power girl, to change a heart
You've got the power girl, to change a heart

The timing's right for all our diff'rences to end
We've come so far from all the places that we've been
My heart is telling me that you're my closest friend
It's alright, hold on tight, and do it all again

[Repeat chorus two times]
