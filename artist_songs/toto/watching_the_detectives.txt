Nice girls not one with a defect
Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs

She is watching the detectives
Oh, he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded, 'cause he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
Visible shivers running down my spine
Cut the baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says, "We never close"

You snatch a tune, you match a cigarette
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
I don't know how much more of this I can take
She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

She is watching the detectives
Oh, he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded, 'cause he's got no heart

You think you're alone 'til you realize you're in it
Now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window, I wonder who is it
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
It nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Just like watching the detectives
So don't get cute
It's just like watching the detectives

I get so angry when the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded, 'cause he's got no heart
Just like watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded, 'cause he's got no heart
It's just like watching the detectives

It's just like watching the detectives
Yeah
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
