All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see you eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me, Rosanna

All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna 
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Chorus:]
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna 
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna 

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna

All I wanna tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna 
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Not quite a year since she went away,
Who is it? Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Repeat chorus]

Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
