You never lose a minute
If in it there is love
And "old man time" always pulls you through
It's better not to depend on the morning dew
For the rose you plant in your bed tends to you
Hard and blue

Some folks take money
Some take their life
Some take forever to see
Blind faith, blind love
They're no mystery to me
You must take the time
For that's the fee

It's worth the pain that makes the tears
It's worth the light of a million years
Only your love I can't explain
You are the flower for my rain

You light the sun that shines from my eyes
It's all in return for what you're givin' me
You are the reason for the earth beneath my feet
And you kill the space that I call free

It's worth the pain that makes the tears
It's worth the light of a million years
Only your love I can't explain
You are the flower for my rain

[Instrumental break]

You are the flower for my rain
You are the flower for my rain
You are the flower for my rain
You are the flower for my rain
You are the flower for my rain
You are the flower for my rain
