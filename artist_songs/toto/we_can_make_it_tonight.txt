I'm counting on you
Gotta know
The time has come to follow through
Drive straight through the night
Just hold on
We can make it home before daylight

There's a voice inside you
And you know it can't be wrong
So break away from this pain, girl
We've held out much too long

We can make it tonight
If you give me the sign
And I'll be by your side
I've got the feeling it's right
We can make it in time
We can make it tonight

Fear nothing at all
Ya gotta know that nothing is impossible
The things I've seen with these eyes
Precious dreams
That somehow you don't realize

Well there's a thirst inside you
I know I can't be wrong
So let's get out of the storm girl
We've waited much too long

We can make it tonight
If you give me the sign
And I'll be by your side
I've got the feeling it's right
We can make it in time
We can make it tonight

[Instrumental brake]

Oh, we can make it tonight
If you give me a sign
And I'll be by your side
I've got the feeling it's right
We can make it in time
We can make it tonight

We can make it tonight
If you give me a sign
And I'll be by your side
I've got the feeling it's right
We're gonna make it right on time
We can make it tonight
