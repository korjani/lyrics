There's a rumour of a midnight man
So silent in disguise
And every time he looks your way
You can see it in his eyes
Like a window to the storm
He just invades your paradise
Don't you buy what he is selling
It's just lies 

When he says:
"These hearts are willing"
The story goes:
That these dreams are free 

Only takes a moment
But you must acclimatize
Don't you buy what he is selling
it's just lies

Over your left shoulder I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield 

[Chorus:]
We're walking through mindfields
You see an angel as she takes you by the hand
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's saying 

There's a stairway leading to the sun
I walk it in my sleep
And a ship of fools above the sky
Who've gotten into deep
With a doorway into nowhere
And the path is way too steep
Don't loose your angry soul
It's yours to keep 

Where it ends
It's the beginning
And it stays
Right to the end 

The reason is unclear my friend
It almost makes me weep
So don't loose your angry soul
It's yours to keep 

Over your left shoulder I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield 

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Over your left shoulder I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield

[Repeat chorus two times]
