My faithful companion
I've lost my way once again
A prisoner of darkness
I let you down my friend

A heart left abandoned takes so long to heal its wounds
Your touch not forgotten
The end of the dream
It comes too soon
In this lonely room
Till I leave this world
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time

The road that I travel
Don't know which way I should turn
Till I find the answer
Know that the fire within me will always burn

Angel of mercy, please 
Why so much pain?
I cry for forgiveness
I'm the destitute man
Who still remains
It's so hard to explain
Till I leave this world
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time

Sometimes I feel just like crying
I can't turn my back
All these years I've been trying
A vision of you keeps reappearing to me
You can't blame yourself
Just reach out your hand and believe

[Instrumental break]

We sail in dark waters
Lord give me some peace of mind
Temptation before me
Ahead lies the tower of truth that I must find
To you I will climb
Till I leave this cruel world far behind
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time
[repeats 2x]
