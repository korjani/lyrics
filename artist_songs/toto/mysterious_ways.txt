I must have aged twenty years in the last seven days
Living on emotion, disbelieve and rage
I found out the hard way life is what you make
Sometimes you gotta learn to give yourself a break 

You can go where you wanna go
You can know who you want to know
Take a good look inside you'll see
You can have it all 
If you just believe 

Time moves in mysterious ways
You're dancing to the music while the music plays
Accelerates and then delays
Time moves in mysterious ways 

[Chorus:]
Accidents can happen and they always do
It only takes a twist of fate to turn on you
I was in the wrong place at just right time
I thought she was a lover not a friend of mine 

You can do who you wanna do
You can screw who you want to screw
In the end it's the fantasy
But not reality
That will set you free 

[Chorus]

Once it's inside of me
It's like a symphony
On a cloud and I can't come down
It's like a dream then you come around 

[Instrumental break]

You can go where you wanna go
You can know who you want to know
Take a good look inside you'll see
You can have it all if you just believe 

[Chorus]

Time moves in mysterious ways
You're dancing to the music while the music plays
Accelerates and then delays
Time moves in mysterious
Time moves in mysterious
Time moves in mysterious ways
