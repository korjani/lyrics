Everybody's moving way too fast
Before you blink you better find out who's in your path
The pressure's building up on every side
In my heart I know that I've got nothing to hide
What would make you think that you're the only one
Now I know my troubles have just begun

[Chorus:]
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decide

You never know what the night could bring
Every moment all the angels begin to sing
Why the worry - just to save your pride 
With all the answers buried so deep inside
It doesn't take a crystal ball to see the truth
It's gonna take a miracle to see this thing through

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Chorus: 
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
I'm on the run and you can't say that I haven't tried

I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decide
