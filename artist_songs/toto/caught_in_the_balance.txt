What happened to me 
It seems so long ago
The cuts run deep
But the scars still show
I live in the shadows
Where it's been so hard to grow
I'm still a servant in a nobleman's robes

You know my weakness girl 
You know my kind 
You helped me see when I was blind 

[Chorus:] 
It's a crime to live my life without you 
Serve out my years in darkness 
Inside these walls I'd die without you
And when I close my eyes I'm caught in the balance

Afraid of the hurricane I hide in my domain 
I need release from all this pain 
Please don't forsake me 
In these ruins I call home 
I can't wait forever
Don't leave me alone 

I have a secret if you wanna learn 
I will surrender in return 

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break] 

You know my weakness girl 
You know my kind 
You helped me see when I was blind

[Repeat chorus two times]
