I never felt like this with someone,
I never knew I could feel this way at all
Predestination by appointment, 
Storybook realities are coming true
I was scared, you looked so helpless, 
Lust was dressed in good disguise

I took you on to meet my mother
Just like me, she fell straight in love with you
You took me to your own apartment, 
was it me or does the night do things to you
You read from Venus and Adonis, so honey how could I resist I

C'mon baby we've got tonight
No one loses when two tigers fights
I lift you up, never let you down
I'll be the jester and you'll be the crown
We're instinctively impulsive, we're animals

A body like yours should be arrested, 
Honey I should be locked up in a cage
We are flesh, we are carnal, we are human
We've got desires we can't contain
Smoke alarm is going off again, 
I guess I'm gonna have to cool you down

Say c'mom baby, we've got tonight, 
No one loses when two tigers fight
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, 
so come on baby melt me ooh so nice
Instinctively impulsive, we're animals

[Instrumental break]

Some girls may turn my head, 
but only you, baby, turn me on
When we touch it's so explosive, 
it's seems my life's been leading to this

Say c'mon baby, we've got tonight, 
no one loses when to tigers fight
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, 
so come on baby melt me ooh so nice
Is it rythm, is it magic, we're animals
