It's a twelve o'clock depression
My mind is in recession
And I can't answer you
It's the day I can't remember
I think it's late September
Or is it April blue

I can't find peace of mind in a world so unkind
It's just a little heartbreaker
Just a little heartbreaker, yeah

It's a sticky situation 
When I'm near hallucination
And I refuse to bow
They used to think me funny 
When I promised them their money
But they're not laughing now

I can't find peace of mind
Then she calls me just in time
She's a gift with a golden gun
And she's got them on the run
She's a gift with a golden gun
'Cause she knows what they've done

[Instrumental break]

I can't find peace of mind
Then she calls me just in time
She's a gift with a golden gun
And she's got them on the run
She's a gift with a golden gun
'Cause she knows what they've done

Just what they've done, done, done, done, done
What they've done, done, done, done, done
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done...
