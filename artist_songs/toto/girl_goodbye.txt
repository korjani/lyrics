Well I'm out on the road
And the devil's got my soul
And I'm looking for the Lord
In New York City

Yeah I'm out on the run
Got some heat, got a gun
If they don't find me soon
It'll be a damn pity

So it's
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries

Oh there's smoke in the air and there's blood everywhere
But I'm hoping that the white man don't recognize me
I'm so sorry what I've done and I say it not in fun
When I tell you that there's no one left inside me 

And it's
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries

Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries

[Instrumental break]

So it's
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries
