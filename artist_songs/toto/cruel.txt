What you've got
You had to steal
That's the reason
For how you feel
Considering what
You've done so far
I'm rather amazed
At where you are 

Lift your head up babe
Pull yourself together
Nothing's worse than dying slow
There's no reason darling
Reason whatsoever
That we can't end this game of touch and go 

It's such a cruel world
When you have to think twice,
And you're caught up in this roundabout
It's such a cruel world
When your back's against the wall 
And there's no way out 

You're not giving it up,
But you're giving it out
Seems to me,
You got a little too much doubt
Augmentation,
Is what you need
Your generosity
Looks alot like greed 

You might call me crazy
If you don't understand it
There's no way for you to know
You say love is hazy,
And you don't demand it
Can't we end this game of touch and go 

It's such a cruel world
When nothing goes right
And the plans you made
Start falling 'round you
It's such a cruel world
Well, just throw me the rope babe
And pull me out 

You've got that kind of love
It flows like a fountain
But sometimes love can be unkind
My kind of love you know
It's higher than a mountain
But love can be so hard to find 

Lift your head up babe
Pull yourself together
Nothing's worse than dying slow
There's no reason, darling
Reason whatsoever
That we can't end this game of touch and go 

It's such a cruel world
When you have to think twice
And you're caught up in this roundabout
It's such a cruel world
When your back's against the wall and there's no way out 

It's such a cruel world
It's such a cruel world out there baby
It's such a cruel world
It's such a cruel cruel world and there's no way out

What love
Get you right
Wanna get you right

Oh I - I see darkness in your future babe
Oh I - It's a tunnel black as night
Oh I - See a rich man with his hand out babe
Oh I - Know a seer with no sight
Oh I - Watch fire burn those bridges babe
Oh I - Feel wrong turn into right 
Oh I - Yeah
Oh I - Do you understand me babe
Oh I - Ooh
