We keep hurting each other
When words can't be easily said
No understanding or reason
Just fear and confusion instead
We need hope for the future
And the young need a chance to survive
No one knows the pain that's felt by the innocent
Wo are Fighting to stay alive
Can no one see the tears in their eyes

Only the children
Only the children cry
Only the children

Why do those who have plenty 
Ignore those with nothing at all
Why must the ones just beginning
Stand with their backs to the wall
They keep asking for answers 
And we keep on telling them lies
They only want to understand what they feel inside
The hunger that tears them apart
It's the one thing they've known 
From the start

Only the children
Only the children cry
Only the children
Only the children cry

[Instrumental break]

Only the children
Only the children cry
Only the children
