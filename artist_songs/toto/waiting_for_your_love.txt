Hands, don't let her go, 'cause then the midnight icy winds will blow
Eyes, give every drop, this ain't the way that should have made her stop
Arms, just  let her know,  no one fills the place she used to go
Smile, don't leave me now, 'cause you're the reason she's here anyhow

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

[Chorus:]
I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here all the time right in front of me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time it's been here right in front of me

Look, forget your pride, she might kiss as you're like even tide
So, be in her heart, especially when we're apart
Love, be by my side, 'cause if she leaves there ain't no place to hide
Soul, be with her now, 'cause you're the first one she knew anyhow

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
'Cos if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been sittin', waitin' for your love, 
And all the time it's been here right in front of me
Draw the line, I'll step across, even further I give in, you got me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time it's been here right in front of me
Just separated by ten thousand miles, you're not alone, girl you got me
Guess I needn't tell you that I'm not around, I'm inside, you got me
I've been waitin' for your love
it's been here all the time right in front of me
