Only the wind sang the words he could hear
Born of the sand washed ashore on a tear
Time wrote the lines on his face like a scroll
Love is a loss to the man with no soul

Run through the darkness he hears
Turn back
There's no survivors
You can't turn back
Dreams keep him turning back the years

[Instrumental break]

Raising his sail cast away on his own
Motherless child on a sea all alone
Morpheus calls but they won't lay him down
Creatures of midnight appear with no sound

Run through the darkness he hears
Turn back
There's no survivors
You can't turn back
Dreams keep him turning back the years

[Instrumental break]

Run through the darkness
Turn back the years
Turn back the years
