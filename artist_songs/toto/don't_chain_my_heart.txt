Tired and frozen
I'm under your spell
I thought I knew you
But now I know you well
I wake up beside you
Move across your killing floor
I need my freedom and I see an open door
The room is getting smaller and the walls are closin' in
No one's leavin' and nobody's gettin' in

I try to run
I try to hide
I try to tell you what I'm feelin' inside
Should I stay
Should I go
You know I wanna touch you
But there's nothing left to hold

Don't chain my heart
Don't chain my soul 
Don't chain my heart
'Cause you got to let it go

Looks like trouble
The signs are everywhere
I bend a little but you take more than your share
Crimes of passion
Crimes of mortal men
It's a deadly attraction and I won't be fooled again, baby
The storm is coming
The winds begin to rise
Please release me from this house of compromise

All day
All night
Your love is like an outlaw waiting till the time is right
Nobody's wrong
No one's to blame
Maybe it's just too hot because we're standin' in the flame

Don't chain my heart
Don't chain my soul 
Don't chain my heart
'Cause you got to let it go

I'm a victim of your pain and jealousy
I feel like a prisoner and you hold the lock and key
We lost our vision
We lost our paradise
But there's still a part of me I refuse to sacrifice

[Instrumental break]

I try to run
I try to hide
I need to tell you what I'm feelin' inside, baby
Should I stay
Should I go
You know I wanna touch you
But there's nothing left to hold

Don't chain my heart
Don't chain my soul 
Don't chain my heart
'Cause you got to let it go
