Screaming at the sun and I might have spilled a little moonshine on my head
Didn't have to run, but there was no one left behind 'cept for the dead

I didn't see it comin', but that rummy-stilted crackpot knew my game
Left my head a'hummin', like a ball peen hammer drives a nail to shame

I suggest you listen up to what I have to say
Witnessed many crooked things, I smell your DNA
Stab me, take me down, you know you'll never get your way

Taint your world
You're so far away from where you think you need to be
Taint your world
Cause you don't want to f**k with me

Didn't anybody get the cipher from that flying rat machine
Gnarly, little, scrunched up, tiny fingers, and its disposition mean

Anybody out of line will soon be on the list
My back's against the wall and yet I know I must resist
Time to tell the truth, I think somebody's gettin' pissed

Taint your world
You're not even close to where you think you need to be
Taint your world
You got another guess comin' if you think you're foolin' me

Taint your world
So far away from where you think you need to be
Taint your world
Where I belong just like an oyster and a pearl
Taint your world
You're not even close to where you think you need to be
Taint your world
Taint your world
