They keep looking through the window
A cathode glaze across their eyes
Now that I've been betrayed
I must be well behaved
I'll drink corruption with their lies

Why was I hiding out?
What am I running from?
Why are they waiting?
Have I always been the choosen one?

Drag him to the roof
Just push me over
I've got no better place to be
Drag him to the roof
Let's get it over
It's a perfect day to punish me

I wish that lady would defend me
I can't abide by all the laws
I'll buy the magistrate
Can't be a second late
I anxiously await his call

Who made this jigsaw puzzle?
Who'll put the pieces back?
Who'll come and get me
When I have fallen through the cracks?

Drag him to the roof
Just push me over
I've got no better place to be
Drag him to the roof
Let's get it over
It's not a pretty thing to see

Drag him to the roof
Just push me over
I've got no better place to be
Drag him to the roof
Let's get it over
It's a perfect day to punish me

[Instrumental brake]

Drag him to the roof

It's not a pretty thing to see

Drag him to the roof
Just push me over
I've got no better place to be
Drag him to the roof
Let's get it over
It's not a pretty thing to see

Drag him to the roof
Drag him to the roof
Let's get it over
It's a perfect day to punish me
