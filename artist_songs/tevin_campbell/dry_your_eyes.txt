Yeah! 

[VERSE 1:]
Another man has broke your heart 
You run to me 
to ease your pain, yeah 
Why can't you see it in my eyes 
That I'm in love and I want to make you mine, so 
We can't be lovers cause you think you'll loose your friends 
That's what try to tell me time and time again, but no way 
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you 
And you know that I'm tired of watching my baby cry, so dry your eyes 

[CHORUS:]
Baby, dry your eyes 
There's no need for you to cry 
So baby, dry your eyes 
I'll be theere for you always 

[VERSE 2:]
I often lay and visualize 
How sweet it'd be 
Just you and me, babe 
Us side by side and hand in hand 
Ooh, it would be so nice if only you give me a chance 
We can't be lovers 'cause you think you'll loose your friends 
By now you got know that I'll be here until the end 
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you 
And you know that I'm tired of watching my baby cry, so dry your eyes 

[CHORUS]

I'll never give up trying (I'll never give up trying) 
One day you'll be my girl (You'll be my girl) 
Until then 
We're just friends, yeah 
I'll be right there to dry your eyes 

[CHORUS]
