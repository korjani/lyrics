Yeah, baby
Uh huh, c'mon

Baby, it was uncool to love me
And then leave me standing here now without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

[CHORUS:]
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love
Come and love me forever more
[Repeat]

Sometimes when I'm alone I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again and take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

[CHORUS]

And once again I'll be right here
Waiting to share your love
But I hope this time for once
We'll forever mean it, oh

[CHORUS x2]

I'm ready, yeah, to love you
