I know you're thinking 
I've been better off without you by my side 
But baby this season 
I don't want another cold rainy July 

You would think that I'd be better now 
But I'm not 
'Cause I don't have you 
You would think that I'd be better now 
But I'm not! 
'Cause I don't have you 

[Chorus:]
Come back to the world, come back to the world 
Baby back to my world 
Come back to the world, come back to the world 
Baby back to my world 

And I still remember 
The way you used to gently touch my face 
And since last December 
I've discovered that no one can take your place 

Don't be thinking that I'm better now 
'Cause I'm not! 
'Cause I don't have you 
Don't be thinking that I'm better now 

'Cause I'm not! 
'Cause I don't have you 

[Chorus]

And when the nights get lonely 
I think of what you told me 
Saying that I was the one 
Tell me you can feel it once again 
I know that we can love like we did then...so 
Bring it on home 

[Chorus]
