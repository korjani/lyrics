Where do they get off telling you
That I am not the least bit into you
Just tell me how the hell they can tell you they know what's in my heart
What do they get from telling you
That I don't give a damn about
Just tell me why the hell someone wants to tear your heart apart

[1:]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do them people like to tell you lies
I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more
I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

[2:]
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You can know that from this moment you were always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do love you
You'll be always in my heart

They're not the ones who'll be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere, be anywhere when things start falling down
They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can't happen, it won't happen, girl, as long as I'm around

Oh, why
Why, why, why
Yeah
Why did you have to listen to the lies
Oh, girl, my sweet girl
There is only you inside my world
Oh, please, baby, please
I wish you could believe in me
Right now, right now
If only you could know
