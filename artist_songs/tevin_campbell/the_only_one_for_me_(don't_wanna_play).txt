[Chorus:]
Don't wanna play those games no more 
I don't wanna break your heart
Don't wanna play those foolish games 
'Cause I feel that you're the only one for me

[Verse 1:]
When I was a young boy I believed 
That love was just a dream 
Played around with your emotions 
From the start But now I can see 
That there is more to life than dreams I finally found someone 
Who makes my life complete 
And I know within my heart 
Your love is true
And that's why I don't... 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
How could I be so selfish then 
Knowing the things that I know now 
All the times I tried to love you 
I needed you to show me how
But now I can see 
That there is more to life than dreams I finally found someone Who makes my life complete 
And I know within my heart
Your love is true So... 

[Chorus: x2]

Do you feel the same way too? 
(Tell me do you feel the same?) 
Is my love too much for you to bear?
(Love too much to bear)
Should I just be on my way? 
I wanna stay

[Chorus]

I played with your emotions 
How could I be so blind 
Don't wanna play those games
'Cause I feel that you're the only one for me
