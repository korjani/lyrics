If we all sing one song 
One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease
One hymn, one theme, one hope, one dream 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing one song 

If we all learn the words 
Just think how great the sound would be 
And since the tune is in freedom's key 
One voice you'd hear, so pure, so clear 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing one song 

There's just one sun that warms our day 
The same moon and stars light our way 
This little ball whirling in space 
It's our only home, our only place 

If we all sing one song 
One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing one song 


If we all sing one song 
One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
Just imagine what tomorrow would bring 
Just imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing 
If we all sing
One Song!
