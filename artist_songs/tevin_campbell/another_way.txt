Early in the mornin' round 3 A.M. 
Lying with a girl named Kim 
With a glass of gin, sippin' on it 
About to hit the skins 
Now I'm all in 

Telephone rang, was a girl named Jane 
From around the way 
How could I forget 
Damn, am I caught? 
"Is it time to quit?" 
Runnin' through my head 

[Chorus:]
I ain't tryin' to run around no more 
Sick and tired of losing track of scores 
Every time I turn around, the same old game 
Another day 
Thinkin' I just wanna settle down 
Tired of living foul, it's over now 
Said to myself there's gotta be another way 

Later in the day, next case was a girl named Trace 
Draped in lace, pink negligee 
Spreadin' her legs 
Drinkin' Perguoet 
Callin' my name 

Telephone rang, 
She said that it was a friend on the other end 
Sounding masculine 
Couldn't believe 
How could I pretend 
Didn't hurt me 

Finally, I can see there's another life for me 
I don't wanna live this way 
I feel it's time I made a change 

I believe I can be a better man and I don't need 
Every woman in the world 
I gotta find myself a girl 

[Chorus]
