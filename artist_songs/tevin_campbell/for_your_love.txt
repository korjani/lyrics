For all the times that I made you cry 
For the cold and lonely sleepless nights 
I sing a song of love to keep you near 
'Cause I wanna come back to you 
And there's nothing for you that I would not do 
You are the other half of me 
Without your love I could not breathe 
So say you'll never leave again 
'Cause I told you lies and criticized you 
But this time there'll be no goodbyes 

[Chorus:]
For your love I would do most anything 
For your love, the sweetest melody I'd sing 
For your love, just to heal the broken wings 
Of our love 
Is for your love 

So many tears I made you cry 
By holding on to my foolish pride 
Tell me why 
'Cause now I regret it (oh yes I do) 
So many days I ran away 
When "I'm sorry" was all I had to say 
I took you for granted 
But it's not how I planned it 

[Chorus]

So many nights I tossed and turned 
Remembering all the bridges I burned 
Two bridges between us 
If only God could have seen us 
Oh, tell me it's not too late to start again 
Maybe this time as the best of friends 
Just never say never 
You believe in forever 

[Chorus x2]
