Are you satisfied
With the way I love you
Are you satisfied
'Cause I just can't deny
That the way you love me
Makes me melt inside
I'm a gonna give it all p my baby
As long as you want it
My kiss is gonna cover your body up and...
Down and all around
Until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
What's your fantasy
Maybe we could play it out
Just you and me
In my wildest drams
I couldn't have imagined
such intensity
No I'm never gonna give you up my baby
A s long as you want me
My kiss is gonna cover your body
Up and down and all around
Until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
I wish that I could extend
The little time that we spend
And so I hope that you intend
To stay with me at least until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
