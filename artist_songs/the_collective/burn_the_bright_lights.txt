Tell me every secret that you've never told
I won't runaway, I won't runaway
They scars that you've been hiding
Don't be afraid to let them show
That's what makes you beautiful
You're so damn beautiful

Hold on don't let me go

And we're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight you and I, are gonna shatter all the heroes
Explode the world that we know
We're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight let's set fire
To all the million reasons
That made you stop believing in you

So can we break the silence
Cause it's killing me
To watch you fall apart (Please don't fall apart)
Please don't fall apart
Cause anytime you doubt yourself
Anytime you count yourself out
I'll be here to pick you up
Girl I'm gonna pick you up

And we're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight you and I, are gonna shatter all the heroes
Explode the world that we know
We're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight let's set fire
To all the million reasons
That made you stop believing in you, you, you

Hold on don't let me go

And we're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight you and I are gonna shatter all the heroes
Explode the world that we know
We're gonna burn the bright lights
Tonight let's set fire
To all the million reasons
That made you stop believing in you

We're gonna burn all the bright lights
Tonight let's set fire
To all the million reasons
That made you stop believing in you
