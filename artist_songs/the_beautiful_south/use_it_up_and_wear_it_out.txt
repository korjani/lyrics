Everybody - all you people gather round
And get your body busy - move it up and groove it down
We're gonna use it up - gonna wear it out
Ain't nothin' left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me
(Shake it down to me)
One two three shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One two three oh shake
Bussy bodys - bodys lookin' good tonight
You got that hungry feelin' for some love and it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
We're gonna use it up - wear it out
Ain't nothin' left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down
(Shake it on down to me)
...

Used it up - wear it out
Ain't nothin' left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)

Do it all night
Do it all night long
Do it all night long
Do it all night
...

Do it all night long
Gonna use it up - gonna wear it out
Ain't nothin' left in this whole world I care about
Gonna used it up - gonna wear it out
Ain't nothin' left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down
(Shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me
(Shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down
(Shake it on down to me)
One two three oh shake
