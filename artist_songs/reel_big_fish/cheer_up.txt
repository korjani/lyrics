You say you're down you can’t lose that frown
Life sucks. What else is new? That’s tough.
There's not much you can do- you're not the only one not havin’ any fun 

I've got a funny feelin’ we’re all born to lose
And I've got a funny feelin’ that this life ain’t worth livin’ through 
I've been depressed and I get so stressed
Life sucks. I don't wonder why. That's tough.
I just keep on tryin’, so I won’t be the one not havin’ any fun

I've got a funny feelin’ we’re all born to lose
And I've got a funny feelin’ that this life ain’t worth livin’ through 
I'm not givin’ up yet that's not the end of me
But it's not gonna be all right you'll see, you’ll see!
I've got a funny feelin’ we’re all born to lose 
And I've got a funny feelin’ that this life ain’t worth livin’ through

Cheer Up!
