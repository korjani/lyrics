I don't wanna go riding in a one horse sleigh
I don't care about a Winter Wonderland anyway
I don't wanna build a man out of ice and snow
I don't wanna kiss a girl under a mistletoe
I don't care if there's presents underneath the tree
Well there's just one thing I need

I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna,
I just wanna, I just wanna skank, for Christmas

I don't wanna eat sugar puffs or candy canes,
I don't wanna go wassailing, whatever that means
I don't care about a white bearded man in red
I don't care about elves or Reindeer-pulled Sled
I don't care if Rudolph's nose is shining bright
There's only one thing I need tonight

I just wanna, I really, really wanna, I just wanna,
I really, really wanna, I just wanna skank, for Christmas

I don't wanna roast chestnuts on an open flame
Silver dolls and tinsel won't make my day
I didn't hang up my stockings above the fireplace,
But I got my dancing shoes on and I'm running in place
Maybe it's cold outside but don't worry,
Once we start dancing we'll be warm in a hurry, Let's go!

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder, Blitzen
You can turn 'em all into medicine
Tales like this sing into medicine.

I don't care about coal in my stockings
Sugar-Plum Fairies are Jingle Bell Rocking
Maybe I can use a little Ho Ho Ho
But we'll just see how it goes

I just wanna skank,
I just wanna skank, (oh babe)
I just wanna skank,
I just wanna skank, (oh babe)
That's all I want, That's all I need
I just wanna skank.

I just wanna, I just wanna, I really, really wanna,
I really, really wanna, I just wanna skank, for Christmas

I just wanna, (HEY HO)
I just wanna, (HEY HO)
I just wanna skank! For Christmas

I just wanna, (HEY HO)
I just wanna, (HEY HO)
I just wanna skank! For Christmas

And there's nobody 
I'd rather be skanking with, than you

(And of course, when I say skank, I'm talking about the ska dance. And nothing else. Merry Christmas)
