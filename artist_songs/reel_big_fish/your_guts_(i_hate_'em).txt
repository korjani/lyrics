I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck
I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck

I hate the way you look
(You make me sick)
I hate the way you talk
(I wanna punch you in the face)
I can't stand you at all
(You drive me insane)
Why won't you go away?

I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck

This is your song
Congratulations
You're the inspiration
I hate you so much
That I wrote this song
Congratulations
You're immortalized
I hate you so much
I hope you fuckin' die
