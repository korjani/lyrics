If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end
I'll always be there

And when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around
And I'll be there

I'm sorry but I was just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me
I promise
I promise you, I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
Gonna always be there

Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no grudge to bear

I'm sorry but I was just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if I had to walk the world I'd make you fall for me
I promise you
I promise you, I will

I tell ya
I gotta tell ya
I need to tell ya

I'm sorry but I was just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me
I promise
I promise you

I'm sorry but I was just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if I had to walk the world I'd make you fall for me
I promise you
I promise you, I will
I will
I will
I will
