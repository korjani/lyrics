Well our story starts, like a lot of them do
A boy meets a girl, and he thinks she's so cool
But then it all turns into a horrible mess
It's true, it's all true

Well when we first met, If I'd only known
I would have run for my life, I would have left you alone
You're evil, and vicious, and cruel, and cold.
That's you, that's you

Dear wicked witch I wasted my time with
P.S. I hate you
I'm finally leaving you today
P.S. I hate you
And if you think I'll ever come back
P.S. I hate you
I've got just one more thing to say,
"P.S. I hate you"

Well you beat me up, mentally
And you killed my dreams, metaphorically
You broke my spirit, quite literally
It's true, it's true

Well it's all your fault, so remember that
You stole my heart, but now I'm taking it back
I want a whole new life, and I'll start it right now
Without you, without you!

Dear evil witch I wasted my time with,
P.S. I hate you
I'm finally leaving you today
P.S. I hate you
And if you think I'll ever come back
P.S. I hate you
I've got just one more thing to say,
"P.S. I hate you"

The joke is on you baby, you're just a psycho crazy
And now you're on your own!
And all my time you've taken, and all my life you've wasted,
Now you're on your own!

You always wanted to control me
You always wanted it your way
But I'm so tired of being your prisoner
I'm finally making my escape

Dear evil bitch I wasted my life with
P.S. I hate you
I'm finally leaving you today
P.S. I hate you
I'm on my way to starting a new life
P.S. I hate you
I've got just one last thing to say
P.S. I hate you, P.S. I hate you, P.S. I hate you!
