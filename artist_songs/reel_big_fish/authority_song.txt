Let's go

They like to get you in a compromising position
They like to get you there and smile in your face
They think, it's so cute when they got you in that condition
Well, I think that it is a total disgrace

And I say when I fight authority, authority always wins
When I fight authority, authority always wins
I been doing it, since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin'
When I fight authority, authority always wins

Well, I call up my preacher and I say, "Gimme strength for round five"
He said, "You don't need strength, you need to grow up, son"
I said, "Growing up leads to growing old and then to dying
And dying to me don't sound like all that much fun"

And I say, when I fight authority, authority always wins
When I fight authority, authority always wins
I been doing it, since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin'
When I fight authority, authority always wins

I said, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

When I fight authority, authority always wins
When I fight authority, authority always wins
Well, I been doing it, since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin'
When I fight authority, authority always wins

And I say, when I fight authority, authority always wins
When I fight authority, authority always wins
I been doing it, since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin'
When I fight authority, authority always wins
