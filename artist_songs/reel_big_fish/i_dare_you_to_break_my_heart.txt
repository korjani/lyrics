I feel it coming on,
I know there's something wrong.
I don't even know you yet
But I know what you want to do to me.
My latest dream girl,
My latest nightmare.
Could this be the start of another,
Long, long, hateful love-affair?
I gotta tell you now,
I just cannot allow,
Anyone else inside my head,
You know I'd rather just drop dead.

Well have cried,
As much as I can cry.
So just give it a try.
And I have bled,
As much as I can bleed.
No one can hurt me anymore.

So I dare you to break my heart,
Come on and give it your best shot.
Baby, I dare you to break my heart,
It's gonna take more than you got.
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart.
Cause I've been working hard this time,
Just getting it hard for you.
I dare you.

Hey, now I think you're great.
And, maybe we could date?
We could go out drinking,
Have ourselves a beer and stay out late.
But I got a heart of stone,
Covered by brick and bone.
If you think you're gonna get close to it,
Well I think you better just get gone.
Don't try to tame me now,
You'll never slow me down.
I'm just gonna get up,
Gonna get right back up and get around.

Well I have bled,
As much as I can bleed.
You'll see what I mean.
And I have cried,
As much as I can cry.
No one can hurt me anymore.

And so I dare you to break my heart,
Come on and give it your best shot.
Baby, I dare you to break my heart,
It's gonna take more than you got.
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart.
Cause I've been working hard this time,
Just getting it hard for you.
I dare you.

Woah yeah!
The harder that you try,
The harder you fail.
The river that you cry,
Is where I'm gonna,
Woah set sail!

Come on, break it!

When all is said and done,
And we have had our fun.
You won't have your chains on me,
You won't claim me as your only one.
I've got one thing to say,
As I push you far away.
Do you think someone like you,
Could make someone like me love you anyway?
The most important thing,
That I have ever learnt.
Is if you're not doing the hurting,
You're the one who's getting hurt.

Woah yeah.
Well I have cried,
As much as I can cry.
Just give it a try.
And I have bled,
As much as I can bleed, baby.
No one can hurt me anymore.

And so I dare you to break my heart,
Come on and give it your best shot.
Baby, I dare you to break my heart,
It's gonna take more than you got.
Oh yeah, I dare you to break my heart,
Come on and give it your best shot.
Baby, I dare you to break my heart,
It's gonna take more than you got.
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart.
Cause I've been working hard this time,
And I've been working hard this time,
Yeah, I've been working hard this time,
Just getting it hard for,
Getting it hard for,
Getting it hard for you.
I dare you.
