I couldn't do it
So I asked for a helping hand
To get me through it
But I guess it wasn't in your plan
Or maybe you were

Just too busy to make time for me
I always put you first
Expected me to figure out things
But they all kept getting worse
When I think about the way you let me down
I wonder if I'm supposed to count on you

How could you ignore me?

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess it's just because
He was never there at all

I can't believe it
Now that I'm looking back
Why didn't I see it
Well I guess I didn't even ask

While you were never
Ever in the places I would go
You never showed yourself
All those heart-felt conversations
Were with me and no one else
When I called your name
You never answered am I insane?
If you saw my suffering

How could you ignore me?

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess it's just because
He was never there at all

It's not hard to let him go
I don't know know why I ever loved him so

Maybe there is something wrong with me
I don't see what they see
Used to fold my hands and close my eyes
And think that you were with me
Now there's something wrong
It doesn't seem to make much sense
I just feel so stupid now

How could I believe it?

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess it's just because

My imaginary friend wooh-yeah (Now I have to find a real one)
Didn't come through in the end wooh-no (Cause' he was never there at all)
He was never there at all
