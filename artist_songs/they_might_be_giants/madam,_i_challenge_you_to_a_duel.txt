I am a man of honor and I am mortified
By your litany of slurs
Such a lot of words
Oh dear

Madam, I challenge you to a duel
My second warned you to be careful
That bell can’t be unrung

Madam, you mistake me for a bumpkin
It’s clear you’re yelling something
Oh, please don’t burst a lung

You are an unfit rival. By spirits taught to sing
But a tune so twisted now
Like all that’s sweet’s gone sour
Oh dear

Madam, you mistake me for a fool
Yes, your little dog may hold the pistols
Although he seems high strung

Madam, I challenge you to a duel
My second warned you to be careful
That bell can’t be unrung
Can’t be unrung
Can’t be unrung
