I just made a mess
I don’t know how
I did but now
The whole place is
A wreck

I made a mess
And now I guess
That somehow I
Have got to clean
It up

It’s a catastrophe
From ceiling to floor
From wall to the other wall
And nothing was spared
What wasn’t destroyed was spilled
And what wasn’t spilled was
Melted or scribbled on
From ceiling to floor
From wall to the other wall

I made a mess
I don’t know how
But now I have
A big mess on my hands
I’ll need a ton
Of mops and glue
And soap and towels
And paint and
Power tools

Trying to clean it up
Is making it worse
Whatever I try to fix
Gets even more wrecked
No matter how much I wash
It looks even messier than
It did before
I’m making it worse
By trying to clean it up

I made a mess
And now I guess
That somehow I
Have got to clean
It up
