Whatever happened to chopped off,
Unloved, resentful appendages?
Will they be phoning us at 3am?
Whatever happened to them?

What is that distant scampering?
Have you secured the gates
And put out the lights?
Though my pounding heart
Nearly drowns it out
What is that scampering sound?

Someone's tampered with the storage unit lock
Someone's dragging something heavy down the block

Whatever happened to decency?
To privacy, to false-bottom suitcases?
What is this angry world coming to?
What did I do to you?
