There's a house at the top of a tree
There's a house at the top of a tree
In the house there's a room
In the room there's a chair
And sitting in the chair is you

There's a nose at the end of a snout
Of a dog with his head out the window
Of a car that's driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you

There's a plan to eat the house
In the mind of a mouse in the woods
And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog
And the dog has his head out the window of a car
And the car is driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you

There are no more potato chips left
In the empty bag in your hand
And the crumpling sound of the empty bag
Makes the mice get mad And when the mice get mad
It leads to a plan to eat the house
And the plan's in the mind of the mouse in the woods
And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog
And the dog has his head out the window of a car
And the car is driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you

And the reason there are no more chips
In the empty bag in your hand
Is that the crumpling sound of the empty bag
Makes the mice get mad Which leads to a plan
To eat the house
But just in time
The dog arrives
To give to the mouse
The potato chips
That you took from the bag
And gave to the dog
To deliver to the mouse
So the mouse would not eat you
