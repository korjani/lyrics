Listen Children, hear this story
That will take you around the world:
In the belly of the vessels
Stowed away nine pirate girls.

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine.
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)

One named Polly had a parrot,
The second named Polly had a parrot, too.
That's the part that is confusing,
And they were identical twins.

The third was Nancy, she was fancy,
Walked around with a fake tattoo.
And four through nine were all named Peggy,
And each one only wore one shoe.

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine.
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)

Legend grew about their daring,
Never did they walk the plank.
They all shared one golden earring,
And the truth is they all stank.

If you finished all your homework,
Brushed your teeth, and done your chores,
And it's not too past your bedtime,
Then your folks might tell you more of the

Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine.
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine.
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
