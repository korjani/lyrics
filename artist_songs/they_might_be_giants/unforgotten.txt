Don't have to be
Your only one
Don't have to be
Something from now on
Don't have to be
What I want at all

Just have to be
Unforgotten

I know your new boyfriend
And you belong with him
The truth is my one regret
The truth is my one regret

Just have to be
Unforgotten
Just have to be
Unforgotten

Don't have to know
What I'm thinking now
Don't have to know
Better days than these
Don't have to know
Where I've been so long

Just have to be
Unforgotten

I know you're leaving now
If I had figured out

Just how to be
Unforgotten
Just how to be
Unforgotten
