Ladies and gentlemen, do not be alarmed.
Please remain perfectly still.
What you are about to see is real.
The performers are not grinning scarecrows sent here to torture and manipulate you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce the twin quasars of rock.
Please give a warm, friendly hand to They Might Be Giants!
