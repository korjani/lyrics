Dressed only in clothes
From her head to her toes
This is the way
The talking part goes

S-E-X-X-Y
More than enough
Around the clock with nobody else
S-E-X-X-Y

There she is
Standing on the bed
Cookie in one hand, wig on her head
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
Unnoticed by few
Very very few
And that includes you

Look inside your mind
Look inside your eye
Secret agent spy, come to see why
S-E-X-X-Y

One finger nail
Across your back
Baby's first gold tooth initials inscribed
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
You gotta understand
She wants to be your man
She's got another plan
