The earth is our one home
The earth is so fragile it seems
It's warmer and warmer
And things have gone from strange to extreme

And then the kids took over
That's when the future began
And when the kids took over
They had an un-secret plan
And when the kids took over
They didn't walk no they ran
It was the future

Neglected deflected 
Can't undo what is already done
Aware now with know-how
With power from the wind and sun

And then the kids took over
That's when the future began
And when the kids took over
They had an un-secret plan
And when the kids took over
They didn't walk no they ran
It was the future

[Spoken:]
Listen up!
I was stomping around with my giant carbon footprint.
But now I got so tiny you really gotta squint.
I learned there was a lot I can do.
Recycling, self-reliance, energy conservation no matter how small.
I even planted a tree now it's twelve feet tall.

And then the kids took over
That's when the future began
And when the kids took over
They had an un-secret plan
And when the kids took over
They didn't walk no they ran
It was the future
