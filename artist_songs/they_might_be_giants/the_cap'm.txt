Do you think there's somebody out there
Someone else who's better than the one you've got?
Well there's not, there's not

When I talk you keep looking away from me
Because you probably think that I'm high on pot
But I'm not, I'm not

Look me over, I'm the Cap'm
You say it's such a joke
But I don't see you laughing

People seem to think you can't be called the Cap'm
Unless you drive a boat
Well, I don't
I don't

Look me over, I'm the Cap'm
Go ahead and mess with me
You'll find out what will happ'm

Sit beside me at the helm
Yeah, this is what I call the helm
And this button here is the fast-forward button

Did you say what I think you just said
My hat looks good on me?
I agree, I agree

Look me over, I'm the Cap'm
You act like it's a joke, but I don't see you laughing

People seem to think you can't be called the Cap'm
Unless you drive a boat
Well, I don't
I don't

I don't
I don't
I don't
