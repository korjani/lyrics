Throw away the thing that tells you
Not to throw the thing away
You'll forget to rue the day
You went ahead and threw the thing away

Nine secret steps
To the key to the door that you'll
Throw in the well and let go
Of all your thwarted dreams
And visions of success

Amputate the thought that says
You shouldn't ever amputate a thought
You'll be overwrought until
You go ahead and amputate the thought

Nine secret steps
To unlock the potential
To forgo the knowledge
Of what can be attained as long
As nothing's ever gained

I can't tell you what's in secret step five
You will know when you're no longer alive

Inhume your gloom within a tomb
Confine your mind behind a line
There's only doom outside your room
Confine your mind behind a line

Nine secret steps
To the key to the door that you'll
Throw in the well and let go
Of all your thwarted dreams
Let go of all your thwarted dreams
Let go of all your thwarted dreams
Of all your thwarted dreams
