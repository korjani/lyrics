Hi, I forgot your name
Whatever
My point is
Hi, your head's on fire

Oh damn, you must've got one of them
Combustible heads
I read an article all about them

You're on fire
You're on fire
I won't lie
You're on fire

Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head 

Hey, how's it going
Is that your car they're towing?
I'm pretty sure that's your car
No, you can't park there
Whoa, your head's on fire

Oh damn, you must've got one of them
Combustible heads
I read an article all about them

You're on fire
You're on fire
I won't lie
You're on fire

Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head (I won't lie)
Combustible head

The lights are low
The music is extremely loud 
You're hard to get to know
But you're easy to spot in a crowd

As I'm sure you're aware
You've got one of those rare
Combustible heads
I read an article all about them

You're on fire
You're on fire 
I won't lie 
You're on fire 

Oh damn, you must've got one of them (Oh damn)
Combustible heads (You must've got one of them)
I read an article all about them (Combustible head)

You're on fire (Combustible head)
You're on fire (Combustible head)
I won't lie (Combustible head)
You're on fire (Combustible head)

I won't lie
