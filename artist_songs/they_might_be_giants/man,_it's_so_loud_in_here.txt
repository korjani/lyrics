They fixed up the corner store like it was a night club
It's permanently disco
Everyone is dressed so oddly I can't recognize them
I can't tell the staff from the customers

Baby check this out, I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they stop the drum machine and I can think again
I'll remember what it was

You have to carry all your things
You can't misplace them
There's nowhere to place anything

Baby check this out, I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they stop the drum machine and I can think again
I'll remember what it was

They're all shouting something at us, waving and pointing
They revamped the airport completely now it looks just like a night club
Everyone's excited and confused

Baby check this out, I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they start the love machine and I can love again
I'll remember what it was

Baby check this out, I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
Man, it's so loud in here
Man, it's so loud in here
Man, it's so loud in here
