I think I'd like to call you Mom 
'Cause you remind me of my mom 
I'm gonna go put on my sailor suit 
And we'll go out on the town 

Why don't you let me call you that? 
You're acting so much like my mom 
She didn't like it when I called her name 
You and her are the same 

When we go out 
You'll know someone is there 
You will feel someone staring at you 
You're on my mind 
As I dream of the game 
Where I'm rolling a hoop 
And I turn around to find that you are gone 

Which was exactly like my mom 
And I will go hang up my sailor suit 
And lie face-down on the lawn 

When we go out 
You'll know someone is there 
You will feel someone staring at you 
You're on my mind 
As I dream of the game 
Where I'm rolling a hoop 
And I turn around to find that you are gone 

Which was exactly like my mom 
And I will go hang up my sailor suit 
And lie face-down on the lawn 

I see you moving towards the door 
'Cause you don't trust me anymore 
I need to find someone who's nice to me 
The way that you used to be 

And then I'm gonna call her You 
'Cause she'll remind me of you 
I'm gonna dress her in a sailor suit 
That would look very cute 

When we go out 
She'll know someone is there 
She will feel someone staring at her 
She's on my mind 
As I dream of the game 
Where she's rolling a hoop 
And she turns around to find that I am gone 

Which was exactly like her mom 
And she will go hang up her sailor suit 
And lie face-down on the lawn
