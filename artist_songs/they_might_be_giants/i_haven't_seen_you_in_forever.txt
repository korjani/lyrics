I haven’t seen you in forever I’m so sad cause I missed you so much
I missed you so much I’m so so sad
I haven’t seen you in forever I’m so sad cause I missed you so much
I missed you so much I’m so so sad
I haven’t seen you in forever I’m so glad we're together again
together again I’m so so glad
I haven’t seen you in forever I’m so annoyed cause I forgot how much you bug me
I forgot how much you bug me
I’m so so annoyed
Go away and leave me alone. No you go away. No you. No you no you.
No you. No you NO YOU. NO YOU.
Since we’ve been apart I see that I cannot live without you
I cannot live without you don’t ever leave me again
I haven’t seen you in forever I’m so glad we're together again
together again I’m so so glad
