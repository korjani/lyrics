Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
Their voices are the echoes' mausoleums turned to sand
Empty hollow sockets freeze the soldiers where they stand
The darlings of Lumberland

It's getting difficult for a ghoul
Wax museum dreams are so foolish
No rehearsal, no finishing school
It's getting difficult for a ghoul

Hold my cold dead hand for a bit
Just got my cast off, I'm gonna blast off
A little melody if time permits
Hold my cold dead hand for a bit

Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
Pull you off the bank and by popular demand
Drag you by your mind, now you're under their command
The darlings of Lumberland

Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
Their voices are the echoes' mausoleums turn to sand
Empty hollow sockets freeze the soldiers where they stand
The darlings of Lumberland
