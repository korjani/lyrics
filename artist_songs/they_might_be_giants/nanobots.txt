(Grow the nanobots up)
Grow the nanobots up
(Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk)
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
(Wind the nanobots up)
Wind the nanobots up (Wind them up and ask them a question)
Wind them up and ask them a question

(Raise the yellow bots up)
Raise the yellow bots up
(Raise them up and make them respect us)
Raise them up and make them respect us
(Wind the marching bots up)
Wind the marching bots up (Wind them up and wish them away)
Wind them up and wish them away

What with all the hullabaloo
We very nearly forgot about you
Now all the old troubles will soon be at an end
And all the new ones will begin when we send the signal
To the newborn citizenship
Of the micronations
Sleeper cells awaken, now this is your time
Hear the voices calling to their confederates
See the tiny figures testing their limbs
Stand back and watch them

Grow the nanobots up
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
Wind the nanobots up
Wind them up and wish them away

The sun is rising in the wrong place
I would decorate the room but there's no more space
All I see is pictures of matchstick men
I turn my back for two minutes and they've grown again
Rearranging beds
Eating what's available
In some hand-me-downs
Making do with leftovers
Bunking up, sharing comic books
Sitting three-deep on each other's laps
In a van stacked up on other vans
Driving on a tidal wave where they

Grow the nanobots up (Grow the nanobots up)
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk (Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk)
Wind the nanobots up (Wind the nanobots up)
Wind them up and wish them away (Wind them up and ask them a question)

Raise the yellow bots up (Raise the yellow bots up)
Raise them up and make them respect us (Raise them up and make them respect us)
Wind the marching bots up (Wind the marching bots up)
Wind them up and get them to send a signal (Wind them up and wish them away)
To the newborn citizenship
Of the micronations
Sleeper cells awaken now
This is your, this is your time
