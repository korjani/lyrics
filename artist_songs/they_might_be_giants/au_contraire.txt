David Bowie came to town
Flying overhead
"Don't you dig my chops?" he cried
This is what they said
Au contraire, Dave
Quite the opposite, in fact
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, mon frere

Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Knew not what to do
"This tie clashes with my hat," he cried
"Don't you think that's true?"

Au contraire, Delano
Hate to rain on your parade
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, mon frere

Jodie Foster held two pair
Bach had three of a kind
Gandhi said, "With my full house,
I will blow your mind!"

Au contraire, Mahatma
Hate to contradict you, but
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, yes au contraire

And au contraire, you square
Wash that notion from your hair
If you're still there, I must declare
That au contraire, mon tres
Bon frere

Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on! Right on!
Right on. Right on.
Right on!
