Let your hair hang down
It is now the time
To untie your hair
Let your hair hang down

Why do we resemble concrete?
Did we order all these rain clouds?
Who overturned the party cart?
Who said to stomp the fire out?

Let the wrong be wrong
Would it be so bad?
When your hair's so long
Let your hair hang down

Do we have to drag the drag around, is that the plan?
Can't we leave the barking dogs and join the caravan?

Let your hair hang down
It is now the time
To untie your hair
Let your hair hang down

Without a written guarantee of perfect sailing
Can you crawl from under the porch without a helmet?

Before we can get all the facts
We may be going to have to act

Let the wrong be wrong
Would it be so bad?
When your hair's so long
When you look so sad
Let your hair hang down
It is now the time
To untie your hair
Let your hair hair down
