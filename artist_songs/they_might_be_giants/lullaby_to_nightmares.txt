Have you ever seen a bloody egg?
Glass in hand, lying up in bed
That's the time to sing this cowardly lullaby
And you ought to know why

Lullaby to nightmares, whispered low
In the night where batwings flow
That's where all the frightmares go
When the elephants die
Wouldn't you like to try?

Have you ever heard the blackbird's song?
Summer days, all summer long
Underneath a shady tree a shadow sitting next to me
And we stare at the sun

Lullaby to nightmares, whispered low
In the night where batwings flow
That's where all the frightmares go
When the elephants die
Wouldn't you like to try?
