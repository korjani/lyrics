What do you think-what do you make out of that recording?
I don't know, Gloria, I just-
Some kind of singing. They sound like all kinds of people, right?
Yeah.
And then it says "Another child is born in India every time you call this number," right?
Yeah, right.
Does that make any sense to you?
No, it doesn't make no sense to me.
And the guy that spoke-I don't know who he is.
Yeah.
But that-it doesn't sound like no answering machine, right?
No, it ain't an answering machine because they're not saying anything, they're just-
But what does he get-how does he make money on this?
Whatever he's advertising in the paper, that's the part that don't make no sense.
Oh, he's advertising this in the paper you saw it.
In the Village Voice, yeah. They got-that's where the Kiss Clinic, but they give you another number if you wanna join it.
And I got "Intellectuals meet with other intellectuals."
Yeah.
"Speak another language."
Yeah. Oh.
They meet at La Mai-La Maisonette restaurant. They give you the price.
Then they give you another number to call if you're interested.
This guy, all you get is this here recording, but I don't see how he makes money.
Yeah, yeah.
You know what I'm saying? It's just-they got the craziest things in that paper.
Yeah.
They come over with all-they got the craziest things.
But this one here- "There Must Be Giants," it's called.
And it says, "Call machine," and they got the phone number.
Yeah.
But what kind of money does he make? It don't make no sense. Well, he don't make any money, right?
No.
But, then-then he's a nut, right? Do you see-do you see any sense to that? "There May Be Giants?"
That re-that recording I have on. The new one. Did you hear it? I changed it.
I took off the intellectuals. I put on There May Be Giants.
What?
Who's They May Be Giants?
What are you talking about?
That's what's on my-the phone, There May Be-argh, well I can't explain it.
'Cause I don't know what it is. Look in the paper, don't blame me if the guy's a nut.
