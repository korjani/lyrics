Electric car
On roads so dark
To change the end
Rewrite the start
Electric car
So good, so far

Electric car
On verdant green
Invent a turn
Invent a dream
Electric car
The new machine

Let's take a ride in an electric car
To the West Side in an electric car
How can you deny an electric car?
Won't you take a ride with me?
Come on and take a ride with me

Electric car
Beside the tree
Roll past the dock
Roll past the sea
Electric car
Roll silently

Electric car
On roads so dark
To change the end
Rewrite the start
Electric car
So good, so far

Let's take a ride in an electric car
To the West Side in an electric car
How can you deny an electric car
Won't you take a ride with me
Come on and take a ride with me

No diesel, steam, or gasoline
Let's take a ride in an electric car
Happiness resides in an electric car
You can even drive an electric car
Won't you take a ride with me?
Come on and take a ride with me

Let's take a ride in an electric car
To the West Side in an electric car
How can you deny an electric car?
Won't you take a ride with me?
Come on and take a ride with me
