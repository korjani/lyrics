While they were staring at the Citgo sign
Is when they lost our trail
They thought we were part of a caravan
But we had other plans

You can't catch me
Where I'm gonna fall
You can't catch me
Where I'll hide
This world's too cold
This Nova rolls
I'm moving to the sun

93 miles times a million more
Quite a trip we've planned
I must drive now carefully (I must drive now)
And figure where we'll land

You can't catch me
Where I'm gonna fall
You can't catch me
Where I'll hide
This world's too cold
So I'm gunna run
I'm moving to the sun
