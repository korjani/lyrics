First, the DJ must power up the amplifiers.
To play a record, select an album and put it on the turntable.
The racer must attach five dollars to their car and drive to the DJ booth.
Signal the DJ by ringing the bell.

I see that Banksy left a Post-it note for Anonymous, for Anonymous
It seems the after-party has been moved to your house, to your house
It's a special night of anticipation
The moonbeams strong on the old Bandshell

Celebration
You're a little bit better and ready for some
Celebration
Some time to get louder and not by yourself

I see that someone left their cheat sheet by this microphone, by this microphone
I think the rock 'n roll girls in this world want apologies, want apologies

I read this stuff, but I don't believe it
I'd change it 'round, but I don't know how

Celebration
You're a little bit better and ready for some
Celebration
Some time to get louder and not by yourself

Perpetrators of invisible crimes
Our only magistrate sits in our minds
The audience cheers as some people attack
The secret smile of security guards

You hear the cataclysmic discharge of the optimist, of the optimist
And the unlikely crowd assembled here's like Hieronymus, Bosch Hieronymus

It's hard to see from this elevation
But looking up, you can set it off

Celebration
You're a little bit better and ready for some
Celebration
Some time to get louder and not by yourself
