I am a girl. I'm 11 years old
That's one more than 10
And one less than 12 (One dozen)
At noon (12 o'clock)
I was eating a cupcake from a baker's dozen (Of cupcakes)
That's 13 cupcakes
And the postman rang the doorbell to deliver a package
It was a barrel that came from the jungle

One dozen monkeys jumped right out of the monkey barrel
12 crazy monkeys ran right out of the monkey barrel
11 monkeys ran up into the tree
One monkey stayed behind and now that monkey rides a bike around with me

Mom was upset with the monkeys in the tree
And the monkey on a bike
Which I named Larry
With a dozen bananas she got the monkeys in the barrel
And gave it to the postman to send back to the jungle

But then the monkeys jumped back out of the monkey barrel
12 crazy monkeys ran right out of the monkey barrel
11 monkeys ran back into the tree
One monkey stayed behind and now that monkey rides a bike around with me

His name is Larry
