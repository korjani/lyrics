Youth culture killed my dog
And I don't think it's fair (I don't think it's fair)
And his suicide can be justified
By the tastemakers, how they cried and cried and so

Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
Never, never, never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
But the night lights and my dog's life aren't exactly one and the same

Youth culture killed my dog
And I don't think it's fair (I don't think it's fair)
And the judgement made in the city of hate
Just broke his spirit so

Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
Never, never, never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
But the hiphop and the white funk just blew away my puppy's mind

I don't understand what you did to my dog
And I don't understand what you did to my dog
I don't understand what you did to my dog
I don't understand what you did to my dog

Youth culture killed my dog (Youth culture killed my dog)
And I don't think it's fair (I don't think it's fair)
And his suicide can be justified
By the tastemakers, how they cried and cried and so

Youth culture (youth culture)
Youth culture (youth culture)
Broke his spirit so (broke his spirit so)
Broke his spirit so
Youth culture (youth culture)

Youth culture (youth culture)
(youth culture)
Broke his spirit so (broke his spirit so)
Broke his spirit so
