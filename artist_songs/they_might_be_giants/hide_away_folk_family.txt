Hide away folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away
Tippy toe to the front door, Mother
'Cause there's a guy with a long, long fuse
And the one thing you can't hide
Is all the fear you feel inside
As the fuse is spelling out these words

Hide away folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away

Tippy toe to the flatbed, Father
Because they're pouring out our gasoline
And sadly the cross-eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs (sadly)
And his shoes are laced with irony

Hide away folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away

"Hello, this is Lesley Down with the Daily Home Astrology Report:
Taurus, contemplate domestic turmoil
Aquarius, abandon hope for future plans..."

Hide away folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away

(Hide away) Hide away
(Folk family) Folk family
(Or else someone's gonna get ya) Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away
Hide away
