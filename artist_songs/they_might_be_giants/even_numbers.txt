2, 4, 6, 8

Even numbers, even numbers
Every other number is an even number

2, 4, 6, 8
Who do we appreciate?
10, 12, 14, 16
Skip all the numbers in between

Skip all the numbers that are not even
Leave out the odd ones
Leave out the odd; you're left with the even
Skip all the odd ones

Skip the first number and the second one's even
Skip the third and the next one's even as well
Skip the next, take the next, skip the next
Take, skip, take

You like French fries
But you don't like French fries
You've got socks on
But you don't have socks on
You're a girl, but you're a boy
Girl, boy, girl

16, 14, 12, 10
Skip our way back down again
8, 6, 4, 2
You, but not you, but you

Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, red, green
Red, green, red, green, red
She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me
She loves me not, she
