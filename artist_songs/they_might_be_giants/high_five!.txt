High five!
Low five!
Slap me five!
Down low! Too slow!

When it's time to celebrate
With all your friends
There is something you can do
Just open up your hands, and
High five!
(Up top!)
Low five!
(Don't stop!)
Slap me five!
(Woo!)
Down low! Too slow!
(Ohh!)

High five!
(Up top!)
Low five!
(Don't stop!)
Slap me five!
(Woo!)
Keep it cool! Old-school!

Sing this song!
(High five!)
Learn to swim!
(Low five!)
A superhero!
(Slap me five!)
Home run!
(High five!)
Finger paint!
(Low five!)
Count to ten!
(Slap me five!)
Do it again!
(Slap me five!)
Now do it again!
(Slap me five!)

When it's time to celebrate
With all your friends
This is something you can do
Just open up your hands, and
High five!
Low five!
Slap me five!
Down low! Too slow!
(Ohh!)

High five!
(Up top!)
Low five!
(Don't stop!)
Slap me five!
(Woo!)
Keep it cool! Old-school!

High five!
