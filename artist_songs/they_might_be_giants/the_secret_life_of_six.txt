The secret life of six
Means having fun.
When everyone's inside,
He's in the sun.

Six knows how to stand on his head.
Six knows how to stand on his head.
Six knows how to stand on his head.
Six knows how to stand on his head.

And when six pretends he's nine,
He acts older and older.
And when six pretends he's nine,
He wears wiser disguises.

The secret life of nine
Means having fun.
When everyone's inside,
He's in the sun.

Nine knows how to stand on his head.
Nine knows how to stand on his head.
Nine knows how to stand on his head.
Nine knows how to stand on his head.

And when nine pretends he's six,
He acts sunny and funny.
And when nine pretends he's six,
He anounces he bounces.
