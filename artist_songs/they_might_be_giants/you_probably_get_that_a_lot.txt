Do you mind, excuse me
I saw you over there
Can I just tell you

Although there are millions of
Cephalophores that wander through this world
You've got something extra going on
I think you probably know

You probably get that a lot
I'll bet that people say that a lot to you, girl

The way you swing your head while strolling fancy free
Or melting down some army guys to make green tea

Though there are millions of
Cephalophores that wander through this world
You've got something extra going on
I think you probably know

You probably already know
You act like I am stating the obvious

It's the way you swing your head while strolling fancy free
Or melting down some army guys to make green tea

As the headless horseman said to his associate
The bodiless baboon's been cradled in his arms

Although millions of cephalophores are marching past my door
They're invisible to me, except for one cephalophore

You probably get that a lot
I'll bet that people say that a lot while you
Are sarcastically lip-syncing along
To words they felt were spoken spontaneously
