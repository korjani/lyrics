How could the street light
Blink on and off and
Spell out all your thoughts?
That thing you thought you heard me say:
I didn’t say that thing
That is crazy
You’re completely crazy
Pretty soon you’ll be telling me that you’ve
Had enough and you’re leaving me

Picture of a hunched old lady holding a dog and
Telling you what to do
Seemingly random arrangement of turbid material
Telling you what to do
It’s only tea leaves
Stop being dramatic
Next thing you’ll be saying that I’ve been
Hallucinating you all along

Everyone has got a feeling in the gut
You can’t just tune it out
Don’t look at me like that

It’s only tea leaves
Stop being dramatic
Next thing you’ll be saying that I’ve been
Hallucinating you all along

Everyone has got an alien in the gut
Someday it will emerge
Don’t look at me like that

Middleburgh Police Department, how may I direct your call? 
Please speak more slowly I’m only getting every other word
Person I don’t recognize motioning to roll down the window I’m
Only getting every other word 
That is crazy
You’re completely crazy
Pretty soon you’ll be telling me that you’ve
Had enough and you’re leaving me

Next thing you will say
I’ve been hallucinating you all along
Pretty soon you’ll be telling me that you’ve
Had enough and you’re leaving me
