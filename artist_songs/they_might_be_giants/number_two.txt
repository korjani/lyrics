If you need a friend, you know what to do
You can count on me,'cause I'm the Number Two
One day at the beach, the next at the zoo
I'm always around, I'm the Number Two

Two arms to hold ya, two legs for walkin'
Two ears on your head, so you can hear when I'm talkin'
Two feet for stompin', two hands for clappin'
Two eyes on your face, so you can see when I'm laughin'

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

All over the world, you know that it's true
I'm always around, 'cause I'm the Number Two
At home or the park, you know I'll pull through
You can count on me, I'm the Number Two

Two hips for shakin', two lips for kissin'
Too long I've been blue, because it's you that I'm missin'
Two knees for kneelin', two shoulders for shruggin'
Two cheeks to make a little grin while we're huggin'

Ba ba ba ba ba [etc.]

I used to be sad that I am not no one
Until I found out that I am twice as fun

If you need a friend, you know what to do
You can count on me,'cause I'm the Number Two
One day at the beach, the next at the zoo
I'm always around, I'm the Number Two

I am the Number Two, I am the Number Two
I am the Two the Two the Two the Two the Number Two
I am the Two, it's true, the Number Two
[Laughing]
