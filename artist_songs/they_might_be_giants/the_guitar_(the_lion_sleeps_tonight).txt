Hey
Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Is it Jim?
I don't know
Is it Jim?
I don't know

In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion takes control
In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion takes control

Hey
Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone
Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone

Hush my darling, be still my darling
Hey
Hush my darling, be still my darling
Hey

Turn it up
The guitar
I can't hear
The guitar

In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion waves good-bye
In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion waves good-bye

Hey
Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
