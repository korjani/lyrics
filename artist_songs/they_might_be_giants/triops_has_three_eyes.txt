Rabbits have two eyes
And whales have two eyes
And eagles have two eyes
But triops has three eyes
Triops has three eyes

Two eyes on a face
Are usually enough
But triops has got
One that looks up
And one that looks around
And one to keep an eye
On the other pair of guys
Triops has three eyes

Needles have an eye
Tornadoes have an eye
Potatoes have a lot of eyes
But triops has three eyes
Triops has three eyes

Everything with eyes
Has some amount of eyes
And triops has got
One that looks up
And one that looks around
And one to keep an eye
On the other pair of guys
Triops has three eyes

There are two sides to every story
But triangles have three
And the tricycle has one more cycle than the washing machine

Chickens have two legs
And firemen have two legs
And monkeys have two legs
But tripods have three legs
Tripods have three legs

They've got more than you
'Cuz they need more than two
A tripod has got
One that points back
And one that sticks out
And one to be a friend
To the other pair of legs
Tripods have three legs

Look, there's an eye
Hey, there's another eye
And there's a third eye
'Cuz triops has three eyes
Triops has three eyes

Two eyes on a face
Are usually enough
But triops has got
One that looks up
And one that looks around
And one to keep an eye
On the other pair of guys
Triops has got
One that points back
And one that sticks out
And one to be a friend
To the other pair of guys

Triops has three eyes
Triops has three eyes
Triops has three eyes
