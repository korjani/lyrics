I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know what you are, O.

If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about when you took a bite out of my spine,
I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time wouldn't I? Wouldn't that just be fine.

Too late or soon to make noise about* love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow

I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know what you are, O.
