Words fail
Buildings tumble
The ground opens wide
Light beams down from heaven
She stands before my eyes

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual size
As she drives away

Big men
Often tremble
As they step aside
I thought I was big once
She changed my mind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me.
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
Nationwide, believe

She's got
All the money
Money couldn't buy
She's got something special
That someone left behind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual size
Actual size to her

Her face
Hangs in portrait
On the post office wall
She's stuck in my heart now
Where my blood belongs

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
Actual size, believe
