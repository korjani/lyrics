Daddy'll sing bass
Daddy'll sing bass
Daddy'll sing bass
Daddy'll sing bass

I took my boat for a car
I took that car for a ride
I was trying to get somewhere
But now I'm following the traces of your fingernails
That run along the windshield on the boat of car

Daddy'll sing bass

Traces of your fingernails that run along the windshield
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
