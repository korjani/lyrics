Showdown at The Battery
Showdown at The Battery now
Showdown at The Battery, showdown

Put down that snowball now
Got no inclination to play around
Must be hard for you draculas
But nobody's scared of you

I take the long way home
Stay realistic and stay awake
My mind is a wrecking ball
And someday my mind's gonna wreck all y'all
(All y'all)

Showdown at The Battery
Showdown at The Battery now
Showdown at The Battery, showdown

Can you choose your weapon please?
Don't you know, I come prepared
I am a dog walker
But someday I'll be a dog
