Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang, clang, whoops, too late
Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang, clang, whoops, too late

Let's stick together 'cause we're number 8
Let's stick to numbers 'cause we're great

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang, clang, whoops, too late

Hey!
Wait!

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Harbor a deathwish* (help help)
Help, help, help yourself
Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Harbor a deathwish (help help)
Help, help, help yourself

Hip, hip, horrific are the words we sing
Hip, hip, horrific is our thing

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (help help)
Help, help, help, help
Help, help, help
