We wash, we soap, and then we skip some rope
We flip, and dive, and then we count to five
We do the Double Dutch. Do the Double Dutch

Skip skadoodle
Skip-skip skadoodle
Stick out your tongue and wiggle like a noodle
Strut your stuff and you don't stop
Hike up your pants and do the coco pop

Skip skadaddle

Laugh so loud that the dishes rattle
Music takes your mind into a trance
Hike up your pants and do the double dance
