Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Avalanche or roadblock
A jailer trapped in his cell

Money's all broke, and food's going hungry
If it wasn't for disappointment
I wouldn't have any appointments

Side effect or drug trip
Don't tease me with all of your might
Side effect or drug trip
My panacea's in a Xerox shop

Have a nice day, you want it when?
Have a nice day, have a nice day

I didn't expect to find a salesman drinking coffee this late in the morning. How long you been here, Joe?
Oh, I don't know, I guess thirty, forty-five minutes maybe. Why do you ask?
You must be making a lot of sales, piling up good income.
Oh... uh... I'm doing all right. I could do better, but... Ohahaha I get it Paul. Back on that old "Time is Money" kick, right?
Not back on it, Joe, still on it.

Money I owe, money-iy-ay
Money I owe, money-iy-ay
