I can read anything (Read Books! Yes Books!)
I can read everything (Read Books! Yes Books!)
I can explore (Books)
I can learn (Books)
I can discover (Books)
I can Name (Books)
I can read everything (Read Books! Read Books! Yes Books! Yes Books!)
I can read anything (Read Books! Read Books! Yes Books! Yes Books!)

When I go to the library
Those librarians all run to me
and when I walk past the silent sign
I think fine fine fine fine fine

I am so crazy for books
This is a maze filled with books
Books are the fuel to my dreams
Which flies so fast you can't see

Then I go back to my house
Check out the books I just checked out
So many things have just begun
This is fun fun fun fun fun

I am so crazy for books
My mind's a maze filled with books
Books are the fuel to my dreams
Which flies so fast you can't see

I can read anything (Read Books! Yes Books!)
I can read everything (Read Books! Yes Books!)
I can explore (Books)
I can learn (Books)
I can discover (Books)
I can Name (Books)
I can read everything (Read Books! Read Books! Yes Books! Yes Books!)
I can read anything (Read Books! Read Books! Yes Books! Yes Books!)
