Hang on
Hang on tight

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants
They might be rain
They might be heat
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants
They might be brain
They might be washed
They might be Dr. Spock's back-up band

To make the merry-go-round go faster
So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
Just to keep from being thrown to the wolves

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we going to do unless they are

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants
They might be bald
They might be snow
They might be something else in the snow

Hang on tight

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants
They might be fake
They might be lies
They might be big, big, fake, fake lies

Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we going to do unless they are

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)

They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
They might be giants (boy)
