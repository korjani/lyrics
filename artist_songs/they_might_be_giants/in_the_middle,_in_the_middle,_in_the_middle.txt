Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block
Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block

Use your eyes to look up
Use your ears to hear
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear
And wait And wait Until you see the light turn green

Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block

Use your eyes to look up
Use your ears to hear
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear
And wait And wait Until you see the light turn green

Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle in the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle of the block
