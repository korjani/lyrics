Tesla 
Brought the X-ray photo to the world 
Brought the AC power to the world 

Here is a mind 
That can see across space 
Here is a mind soaring free 
Sound turns to light 
And light turns to waves 
And waves turn to all things perceived 

Maybe that knowledge would drive one insane 
How can that knowledge be tamed? 

Tesla 
Ushered the radio wave into the world 
Ushered the neon light 
Into the world 

The Hotel New Yorker 
He's dead on the floor 
The body of Nikola lies 
With just his papers 
No family to tell 
Out of the windows birds fly 

Under an X-ray of Mark Twain's skull 
The plan for the death-ray's design 

Tesla 
Brought the radar detection to the world 
Ushered remote control 
Into the world 
Ushered the bladeless turbine 
Into the world 
Ushered the neon light 
Into the world
