I'm trapped in a world before later on,
I'm trapped in a world before later on,

Where's my hovercraft?
Where's my jet pack?
Where's the font of acquired wisdom that eludes me now?

We're trapped in a world before later on,
We're trapped in a world before later on,

Where's our telray?
Where's our space face?
Where are all the complications we won't see around?
