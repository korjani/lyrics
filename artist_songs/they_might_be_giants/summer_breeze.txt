In a summer house out on Cape Cod
A number of years ago
My cousin Charles heard on the radio
On WEEI
The story of an automobile
That had driven from its garage
And killed a number of couples kissing
Down by the oceanside
Charles thought about the ocean's ways
Down the road just a mile
And as he turned off the radio
He saw with his own eyes
The very same door handle they spoke of
Hooked to that radio dial
And the summer breeze blew in the window
That hadn't been open before
So if you hear a radio
You had best beware
Be sure there's not a car around
'Cause the legend still remains

There's a car without a handle
And that car is still at large

There's a car without a handle
And that car is still at large
