I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla beats his chest
I fall to bits
I confess
I admit I'm impressed
When the torpedo in the vest barks his orders
I'm impressed

And I find that my head's nodding yes
Though my legs are not following
I'm inspired by events
To remember the exits in back of me

I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla pounds his desk
I fall to bits
I confess
I admit I'm impressed
Through generalissimo's request
I can't help but feel impressed

On the one hand he'll
Give you five good reasons to follow him
On the other hand
You see nobody leaving the stadium

I'm impressed, I'm impressed
By that Godzilla's flaming breath
I fall to bits
I confess
I admit I'm impressed
When the tornado from the west crushes buildings
I'm impressed

And I find that my head's nodding yes
Though my legs are not following
I'm inspired by events
To remember the exits in back of me

I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla beats his chest
I fall to bits
I confess
I admit I'm impressed
When the torpedo in the vest barks his orders
I'm impressed
