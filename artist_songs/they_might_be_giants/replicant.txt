Replicant, replicant, where have you been?
Replicant, what is that stuff in your hair?
Replicant, why do you lie on the ground?
Shoveling handfuls of dirt on yourself

You've got his eyes
Same exact smile
Doot doot doot doot
Doot doot doot
doot doot doot doot doot
All that he has
All this will be yours
Doot doot doot doot
Doot doot doot
doot doot doot

Replicant, someone is waiting outside
He says you did something wrong to his friend
Look at me when I'm talking to you
What have you got there behind your back?

You've got his eyes
Same exact smile
All that he has
All this will be yours

I found this when I was cleaning your room
I think you've got some explaining to do
Whatever you did, we'll get through this
Go out the back and I'll deal with the cops

You've got his eyes
Same exact smile
Doot doot doot doot
Doot doot doot
doot doot doot doot doot
All that he has
All this will be yours
Doot doot doot doot
Doot doot doot
