I was working all night in my office
When a man I had recently killed
Called me up from a phone near my building
So I looked out the window at him
He had the same obsequious manner
That was the reason I had him killed
So to calm my nerves I sang this song
To him, over the phone

Turn around, turn around
There's a thing there that can be found
Turn around, turn around
It's a human skull on the ground
Human skull on the ground
Turn around

I was out by myself in the graveyard
I was doing an interpretive dance
When I felt something heavy and pointed
Strike me in the back of the neck
And then the ghost of my dance instructor
Pushed me down into an open grave
And as dirt rained down she played a xylophone
And sang me this song

Turn around, turn around
There's a thing there that can be found
Turn around, turn around
It's a human skull on the ground
Human skull on the ground
Turn around

We were waving our arms out the window
Of a fast moving passenger train
Acting in an irresponsible fashion
Until the engineer whose back had been turned
And who we thought would find us highly amusing
Quickly swiveled his head around
And his face which was a paper-white mask of evil
Sang us this song

Turn around, (round) turn around (round)
There's a thing there that can be found (there's a thing there that can be)
Turn around, (found) turn around (round)
It's a human skull on the ground (it's a human skull on the)
Human skull (ground) on the ground (round)
Turn around (turn around, turn around)

Turn around, (round) turn around (round)
There's a thing there that can be found (there's a thing there that can be)
Turn around, (found) turn around (round)
It's a human skull on the ground (it's a human skull on the)
Human skull (ground) on the ground (round)
Turn around (turn around, turn around)
