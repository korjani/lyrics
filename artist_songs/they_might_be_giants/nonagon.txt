Everybody at the party is a many-sided polygon
When a guest arrives, they will count how many sides it has on
Standing by the window over there
There is a shape with four sides so it's a square
And the one who has nine is looking fine
And its name is Nonagon

Everybody turns just in time to see the pentagon arrive
Counting up the sides, it is clear the pentagon has five
Chatting in the kitchen we see
There is a triangle whose sides number three
And is talking to the shape that has nine
Who is known as Nonagon

Nonagon

Nonagon lets in a guest who has shown up late
Its name is Octagon and its sides add up to eight
Turning the music on
Is a six-sided hexagon
And they all get in a line and do
A dance called "The Nonagon"
