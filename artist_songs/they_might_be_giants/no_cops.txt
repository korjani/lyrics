Hello balcony and folks on the floor
Hello to the sound man, hello to the door
Man smoking out on the street
He can’t comprehend the screaming

We’ve locked all the doors and please understand
We’ve nailed down the latch so meet our demands
In the time that we permit, or else the band will get it

We are here to steal your dreams
Just listen and comply
No cops, no cops, no cops, no cops
Just They Might Be Giants
No cops, no cops, no cops, no cops
Just They Might Be Giants
