They tried the handcuffs but they won't lock
Electrical courses but they won't shock
You pulled the fire alarm
You tried punching a cop
You're just too tired to stop

Old pine box (You old pine box)
With your head full of rocks
Sharp like a cracked flowerpot (You old paper hat)
On your skull full of bats
There's no percentage in that

They called relations but they declined
They called the fan club but they'd resigned
Left your car in a field And some questions behind
Your mom thinks you're out of your mind

Over the falls and into the drink
The barrel breaks and we slowly sink
They tried the handcuffs but they won't lock
Electrical courses but they won't shock
You pulled the fire alarm
You tried punching a cop
You're just too tired to stop
You old pine box
