Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Fall in love with the too-tall girl
Deleterious and delirious
Fall in love with the  too-tall girl
With her magazine
Dressed in aubergine

Too-tall girl can see
Past the rooftops and the trees
Too-tall girl can see
Past the crosstown mall and townie sprawl

There's no kind of guidebook or catalogue
There's no kind of parallel or analogue
Soon you'll just be playing some tag-along
In the world of a girl in a too-tall fog

Bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah

Fall in love with the too-tall girl
Whispers pretty tones in a megaphone
Fall in love with the too-tall girl
Knows more etiquette
Than Connecticut

Too-tall girl can see
Past the rooftops and the trees
Too-tall girl can see
Past the crosstown mall and townie sprawl

To get to her a boy's got to calculate
To get to her a boy's got to estimate
All the walls to clear and the hills to climb
As the months turn to days in this too-tall time
