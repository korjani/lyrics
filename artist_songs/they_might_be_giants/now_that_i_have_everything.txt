The mirror on the wall
Won't talk to me at all
Now that I have everything
The place inside the frame
Just doesn't look the same
Now that I have everything

I wasn't always so fortunate
But I knew what I had to do
To be well-to-do
And it had to do
With the things I had to do

And I don't want anything
I don't want anything
Now that I have everything
I can't tell things apart
I don't know where they start
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday

Put down that surfboard, no, please don't say
All the things I think I know that you're about to say
"Everything is everything," is what you're just about to say

There was a program, sort of an inquiry
Into what would be
Just the thing for me
If it came to be
I would have to wait and see

And I don't want anything
I don't want anything
Now that I have everything
I can't tell things apart
I don't know where they start
Now that I have everything

And the mirror on the wall
Won't talk to me at all
Now that I have everything
The place inside the frame
Just doesn't look the same
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday (Babool Babool)
Babool Babool
