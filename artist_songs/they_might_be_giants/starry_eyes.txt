While you were off in France we were stranded on the British Isles
Left to fall apart amongst your passports and the files
We never asked for miracles
But they were our concern
Did you really think we'd sit it out and wait for your return

I don't want to argue
I ain't gonna budge
Would you take this number down
Before you call up the judge
I don't want to argue
There's nothing to say
Just get me out of your starry eyes and
Be on your way

While you were on the beach were you dreaming all about your share
Planning to invest it all to cover wear and tear
We paid for all the phone calls
The money's on the shelf
Don't you know that while you're gone away
I've got to help myself

I don't want to argue
I ain't gonna budge
Would you take this number down
Before you call up the judge
I don't want to argue
There's nothing to say
Just get me out of your starry eyes and
Be on your way

While you were in the pool we were meeting with the boys upstairs
Talking to the money men and carrying out repairs
We had no time for cocktails
Or working up a tan
The boys have all been spoken to
The writ has hit the fan

I don't want to argue
I ain't gonna budge
Would you take this number down
Before you call up the judge
I don't want to argue
There's nothing to say
Just get me out of your starry eyes and
Be on your way

I don't want to argue
There's nothing to say
Just get me out of your starry eyes and
Be on your way

So get me out of your starry eyes and
Be on your way
