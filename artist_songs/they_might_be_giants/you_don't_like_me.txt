I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

From across a crowded room
You can feel me staring
And you know that I can see
How it is

There's so much pleasure to be had
From Mr. Ian's secret plans
But you don't like me
'cause I can read your mind

I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

You like cigarettes
Swimming laps
Potato chips, Battleship
Cats and Court TV

You like shadow puppets
Woody Harrelson
Reading in the bath
Nirvana and baseball caps

You can hear me talking
Right up till I stop
When I do, I'm gone to you
But you were always there

I can hear the friendly words
Of advice that I'd be offered
If I had a friend
To offer me advice

I'd be told to let it go
And that I care to much
But this is not about me
And you don't want to know

I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

You like Bollywood
Snowmachines
Daguerreotypes, beauty contests
And cruise control

You like booster rockets
Cutting with a fork
Terminator 2
The morning and William Tell
