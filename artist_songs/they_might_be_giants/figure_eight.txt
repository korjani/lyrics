Round, can you go around?
And if you can turn around without falling down,
You can skate in a figure eight.
If you can turn, if you can go straight.

Turn left, go straight.
Turn right, straight again.
And then do it over,
Repeat forever.
That's all you need to know,
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight.

If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight.

If it weren't for the zamboni,
You would never leave the ice.
And I think I know the reason why
You never take a break,
The sign that means forever
Is a sideways number eight.

Turn left, go straight.
Turn right, straight again.
And then do it over,
Repeat forever.
That's all you need to know,
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight.

And if you twist the number zero,
You will get the number eight.

Turn left, go straight.
Turn right, straight again.
And then do it over,
Repeat forever.
That's all you need to know,
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight.

If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight.
(If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight.)

Twist the number zero, you will get the number eight.
