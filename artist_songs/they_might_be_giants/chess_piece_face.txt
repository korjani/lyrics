What's gonna happen to Chess Piece Face
There go I but for my face
All I know could be defaced by the facts in the life of Chess Piece Face

I don't know where he lives
Or if he knows to sail
Or if little schemes like this one ever cross his trail
But I don't believe he's dreaming
Or if he cares to know
So I shudder in my lampshade

So, what's gonna happen to Chess Piece Face
There I go but for my face
All I know could be defaced by the facts in the life of Chess Piece Face
Chess Piece Face
Chess Piece Face
Chess Piece Face
