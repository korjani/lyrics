Davy, Davy Crockett
Traveling through outer space

Reborn in the stratosphere and Saturn-bound
Flying fast and miles off the ground
Jumped from the spaceship just to look around
And shot off his gun without making a sound

Davy, Davy Crockett
King of this brand new place
Davy, Davy Crockett
Traveling through outer space

Off went his rocket at the speed of light
Flying so fast there was no day or night
Messing around with the fabric of time
He knows who's guilty 'fore there's even a crime

Davy, Davy Crockett
The buckskin astronaut
Davy, Davy Crockett
There's more than we were taught

Hiding in the cargo was a robot drone
Programmed to destroy Davy's spaceship home
Davy switched out his brains, now the drone's a dog clone
Named him Copernicus and threw him a bone

King of this brand new place
