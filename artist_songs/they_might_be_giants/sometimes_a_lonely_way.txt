Not everyone you've abandoned
Is still standing by
Not everyone who is lost is
Wondering why

Sometimes a lonely way
Taking your name down from the Jumbotron
Find a new place to stay
And a new home for the trumpeter swan

We can see it now, the scratches
On the back of the door
We can see it now, no mistaking
What you're better for

Sometimes a lonely way
Taken alive in an uncivil war
Trophies and glass displays
Rehearsals for third place, forever more

Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah 
Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah

Not everyone you've abandoned
Is still standing by
Not everyone who is lost is
Wondering why

Sometimes a lonely way
Taking your name down from the Jumbotron
Find a new place to stay
And a new home for the trumpeter swan
