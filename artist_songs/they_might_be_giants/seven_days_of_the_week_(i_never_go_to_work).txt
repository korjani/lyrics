Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.

On Mondays, I never go to work.
On Tuesdays, I stay at home.
On Wednesdays, I never feel inclined.
Work is the last thing on my mind.

On Thursdays, it's a holiday!
And Fridays I detest.
Oh it's much too late on a Saturday,
And Sunday is the day of rest.

Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday.
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday.
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday.
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday.

Practice Monday.
Practice Tuesday.
Practice Wednesday.

Practice Thursday,
And Friday.
And I practiced all night on Saturday,
So on Sundays I played best.

Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.
Oh no, no, I never go to work.

On Mondays, I never go to work.
On Tuesdays, I stay at home.
On Wednesdays, I never feel inclined.
Work is the last thing on my mind.

On Thursdays, it's a holiday!
And Fridays I detest.
Oh it's much too late on a Saturday,
And Sunday is the day of rest.
It's the day of rest!
