Moles. Moles. Spending their lives down a hole
And when it’s raining they get complaining
And run around out of control
Moles

Hounds. Hounds. Walk with their nose to the ground
The joy in their eyes and
The shock of surprise when 
They bring you the thing that they found
Hounds!

Don’t wake up the hibernating bear
He’ll spend all winter there 
Asleep

Bees. Bees. Spend most of their time inside hives
But when the breeze knocks the hive off the trees oh
We better run for our lives.
Bees

Hares. Hares. Some call them bunnies—who cares?
Though it sounds phony
Rabbits were coney
Out on this island right hare. 
Hares
