I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
Shape shifters all around

Where did my world go?
One minute everything is
Home and friends and New York Times and lawn
Beware the blob they said
How was I to know they meant the
UPS delivery man
The koi in the tank and the anchorwoman?

I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
Shape shifters all around

Shape shifter, shape shifter                 
You gotta quit that
Shifting of shapes
I accepted what you were and then
Everything changed
And I don't want to live in any 
place where the people are 
shifting their shapes

They're such a liar
They said the planet wouldn't  
Undulate and then burst into flames
What used to be my house?
Is it that purple tentacle?
Or is that the TV repairman?
The clarinet? The vegetable stand?

I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
Shape shifters all around

Shape shifter, shape shifter                 
You gotta quit that
Shifting of shapes
I accepted what you were and then
Everything changed
And I don't want to live in any 
place where the people are 
shifting their shapes

I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
Shape shifters all around

If you're someone I used to know
I sure don't recognize you so
I'm only hanging round amorphous mounds
In the town where nothing familiar can be found

I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
I've got a big old problem
Shape shifters all around (shape shifters all around)
Shape shifters all around (shape shifters all around)
Shape shifters all around (shape shifters all around)
Shape shifters all around
