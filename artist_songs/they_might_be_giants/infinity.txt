I can count up to five, I can count to ten
Count on my nose a hundred times, I'd rather not again
Twenty is easy and a hundred, no sweat
But there's one number I just can't get

Infinity, infinity
How can I reach infinity?
Well, I count up all day and then one more just to see
But when will I reach infinity?

Well, with tons of patience and even more smarts
I count above a hundred thousand million billion trillion illion
Race to the moon and back again
I'm catching up. You know, I might win

Infinity, infinity
How can I reach infinity?
It's the highest number there could possibly be
But I'm gonna reach infinity

If I chase my tail and follow its tracks
If I run around in circles I'll never make it back
Oh, figure of eight goes around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Infinity, infinity
Who's gonna beat infinity?
So add it up, I just might win
If you help me figure out just where it ends and it begins
Then I just might catch
And you just might see
That I'm gonna reach infinity
