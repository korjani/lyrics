If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy

I'd burn all the uniforms
I'd burn all the "Ask Me" buttons
I'd burn all the intercoms
I'd burn all the time clock cards

If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy

I'd steal somebody's Cadillac
I'd steal anything I lack
I'd steal all the microphones
From all the masters of ceremony

If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy

I'd ask you, if you don't mind,
To kiss you a hundred times

If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy
