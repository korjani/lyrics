Lord, please don't take me away.

Rabid child stays at home, talks on a CB
Truckers pass calling out their handles to the kid
Chess Piece Face and The Big Duluth call her every day
"Hammer down" and "rabbit ears" are the only words they know

Hammer down
Hammer down, rabbit ears
Hammer down, rabbit ears
Hammer down, rabbit ears, hammer down

If you pass the rabid child say "hammer down" for me
The rabid child
The rabid child
The rabid child
