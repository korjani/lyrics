The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round
They hear the instructions
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
They hear the instructions (bringing the people 'round)
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound (they travel great distances to the sound)

They are persuaded by the music of the bells
They're not responsible for anything they do
(No) The people know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound

The bells are ringing
And everyone's walking
With arms extended in a trance
Forgetting their washing
Neglecting the children
They're dropping all businesses at hand

A voice is telling them to act a different way
They tilt their heads so they won't miss what it will say
(No) And when it's so
(No) There's this to know
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round
They hear the instructions
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound

They are persuaded by the music of the bells
They're not responsible for anything they do
(No) The people know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

A girl with cotton in her ears
Is shielded from the bells' effect
As if by hidden signal
The people turn to face her
One thousand eyes are staring
They pull away her earplugs

The bells are pealing
And they're revealing
The simple key to happiness
It isn't evil
It isn't good
It's only what the people miss

The bells explain what they've been lacking all along
They were disorganized and that was what was wrong
(No) And now they know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
They hear the instructions (bringing the people 'round)
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
The bells are ringing (bringing the people 'round)
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
They hear the instructions (bringing the people 'round)
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
The bells are ringing (bringing the people 'round)
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
They hear the instructions (bringing the people 'round)
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound (they travel great distances to the sound)
