Animals can smell your dreams
Or so I have read
That explains the constant sniffing
Under your bed
Or so I have read
It says it right here
And did you know
That mixing paint with milk will make it clear?

Barber poles are found in the wild
And caught in a cage
If you count the stripes
You can determine their age
Or so says the sage
That authored this page
Who owns a self-consuming timepiece
Called the chronophage

Everything you hear is a fact
And the opposite is also correct
If you swallowed up the planet
You would be a wiser man
It would be inside your head
So I have read

You may not believe this
But it has been shown
The reason clouds are white
Is that they're made out of bone
And when I found out
I slapped my own face
For now I know why skeletons
Are up in outer space

Someday in the distant future
So I have read
Microscopic astronauts 
Will land on your head
There's so much to know
Can't put this book down
A mime is the hybrid offspring
Of a human and a clown

Everything you hear is a fact
And the opposite is also correct
If you swallowed up the planet
You would be a wiser man
It would be inside your head
Or so I have read
