You said something before you left
Something I was not to forget

Then
Is when i maybe should have wrote it down
But when I looked around to find a pen
And then I tried to think of what you said

We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two

I would go back to the top of the day from scratch
If I thought that this thing could be fixed
Though sadly I'd do exactly the same thing as when

We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two

You said "I'm gonna run you down"
I heard "I'm an orangutan"

Then
Is when i maybe should have wrote it down
But when I looked around to find a pen
And then I tried to think of what you said

We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two

I would go back to the top of the day from scratch
If I thought that this thing could be fixed
Though sadly I'd do exactly the same thing as when

We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two
I'm an orang-utan
