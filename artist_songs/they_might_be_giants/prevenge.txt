Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge
At the freak show,
in the front row,
mi amigo,
lost in the sound.

Now you know that the girls are just making it up,
Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck
Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist,
and my name's not really on that list.

Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge

Fully moto
On the headfo
Rock the info
The micro-type king

Calling Mr. Pupkin
to join us at the love-in
Because Pupkin comes alive
When prevenge is the plan
See Pupkin take the stand.

Tired of waiting,
Tired of watching,
Negotiating,
Parading around.

Now you know that the girls are just making it up,
Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck,
Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist,
And my name's not really on that list.

Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge,
At the freak show,
In the front row,
Mi amigo,
Lost in the sound.
