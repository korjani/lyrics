Come on baby turn that frown upside down
Tell me why you ain't been around
What is it brings you down?

We work the hardest to be the smartest (we work)
We work the hardest to be the smartest (we work)
We work the hardest to be the smartest (we work)
We work the hardest to be the smartest (we work)

And the big big whoredom scared me

No, no, baby I ain't convinced it ain't so bad as you paint it
There's plenty more heads of hair for us out there
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch (monster)
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch (monster)
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch (monster)
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch (monster)

But the big big whoredom scares me (no no it doesn't do that)
The big big whoredom scares me (no no don't be sad)
The big big whoredom scares me (please please stop it)
The big big whoredom scares me (don't don't)
The big big whoredom scares me (please)
The big big whoredom scares me (no)
The big big whoredom scares me
The big big whoredom scares me
The big big whoredom scares me
