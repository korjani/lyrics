Oi, ain’t that mega
Wait wait, that’s mega, in a TT,
Roof down, wait, with a fucking afro comb in his head
Wait a minute, from down my ends, blinging,
He’s fucking dizzy blud, why me?
Fucking dizzy blud

[Mega]

What did I do to deserve this shit?
Why? I need to know but I know
They think we’ve lost it
They think we ain’t clocking the streets no more
But I can hear you whispering, 
I can hear you speaking
I can hear you, my souls can hear you.
But anyone that knows me,
You know I was born to do this.
This is my life, and still you’re fucking with me
Telling you niggas, talking bout’ you wanna blaze me.
I am prepared for you,
So niggas wanna fuck with me or
Check one of my chicks when there not with me or
Talk about my shit when I go on a tour or
Fuck with my clique, yeh I target score board 
Wait there’s more or
Walk on bye why? Hits for the clips when they Rollin’ by
Chop up my shit prepare to die die
Hate all my cliques till we’re going sky high
I tell you why,
So solid, yeh we’re hotting to this, but don’t miss
Check this and we’re top of the list
So solid, yeh we’re starting the shit, we said we did it
We’re done and you’re full of it yo
Scuse love back in channel club, you never wanna give me a hug
Cus’ im at the bar
Listen, there you were, wanna give me some more
But back in the day you never fucking see what I saw
The house cost 3 years two million g’s
The next time you’re comparing me, 
Check what you never did, believe in me.
Fuck you and your 2 faced crew, 
And tonight you support everything we do
Check 1 that’s right we ain’t begging for none
So solid crew there’re on radio 1
Check 2 yo, see its midnight too
But you’re there and we can talk to the girls and screw
Check 3, that’s right you won’t see me,
But you will hear my voice, anywhere u will see
Check 4, right, I will rap the door, bring more
Don’t fink Mega ain’t been there before.
Check 5, yo, who’s up in the snow?

[Chorus]

Ride wid us, ride ride [x8]

[Tiger S]

Do you wanna ride wit us,
We won’t stop till you’ve had enough.
Do you wanna ride wit us, 
Show, show, show us nuff love.
Do you wanna cruise wit us
We won’t stop till you’ve had enough
Do you wanna ride wid us,
So solid’s bound to take over. [x2]

[Mega]

It’s getting closer now,
People are saying that Mega is there, but,
Mega it’s over now.
Cus’ I’ve got a lot of shit to risk, you hear this?
Can you hear me now? 
Cus’ when I smoked before, you ignored, people would hear me out
Never feel the same thing
Why the fuck you wanna try your luck and move to me,
It’s so easy, to pull out your gat,
Rat a tat tat tat 
Lay 3 niggas on their back
You do that fuckin easy
The hard part, don’t whine like a dark part
Don’t pull out your gat fast; don’t drive in an A-class
Your too fuckin fast you don’t know, take it easy
Life is loveable,
I picture this scene, I’m comfortable
Now let me tell you something, no 2 ways about it
Tell them, so….

[Chorus x8]

[Tiger S]

Do you wanna ride wit us,
We won’t stop till you’ve had enough.
Do you wanna ride wit us, 
Show, show, show us nuff love.
Do you wanna cruise wit us
We won’t stop till you’ve had enough
Do you wanna ride wid us,
So solid’s bound to take over. [x2]

The teaching is over so tell me what your gonna do,
Get with So Solid, or if not good luck to you.
