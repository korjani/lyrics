So Solid, ladies and gentleman, I’m about to resort to violence.
Yo, this is a So Solid criminal gangster production,
Listen cause you don’t play games you know trust me,
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

A yo, Let her know, me in the doe, 
See me yo, busted a show and here I go,
See ma flow, dirty though, 
You never know like woah,
There I go, there I go,
A yo you never know until I made ‘Oh No!’
You know So Solid,
On a roll, dirty though, we dirty though, 
Like there I go, there I go, there I go.

Why d’you really wanna imitate me? – yo

Why d’you really wanna imitate me?      
Why is it that you just wanna be me?
[Repeat]

Ladies when I get down in ma physical, 
When I get down down in ma lyrical mibical,
Ha, lyrical, biblical, bad vibe inside, get up and wants to rhyme,
Ladies when I get down in ma physical, 
When I get down down in ma lyrical mibical,
Ha, lyrical, biblical, bad vibe inside, get up and wants to rhyme.

Wanna be wawanna be wanna be, do what I wanna do wanna do,
So Solid Crew made me realise its an outgoing fight to stay the mike,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe.

[Chorus]
They don’t know about my crew,
They don’t know what I do,
They don’t know about my flow,
They don’t know where I go,
They don’t know about my click,
They don’t know about my shit,
They wanna know about my doe,
But I don’t spend it let it grow.
[Repeat]

Play the part, big time in ma art,
I’m in a hurry in the basement in the dark,
I gotta bring ma elision, I’m gonna spark this,
When ma style is relentless,
People say So Solid never meant this, 
I’m mad and this is ma way to break this,
How many people do you know could’ve wrote this,
How many people do you know could’ve wrote this.

Yo run it up, give up flow,
Ha give me the cash, give me the doe,
Yo I’ve been the bad guy and the hero,
As long as the police make ma statements grow.

I’m making money from jim to the joe,
I’m eating chicken getting shook like crows,
Asher D is at the start of the show, 
You never mimical the crucial though.

Yo stopping the show, you know gonna flow,
A yo lyrical, biblical bad flow, 
Yo stopping the show, you know gonna flow,
A yo lyrical, biblical bad flow,
Yo stopping the show, you know gonna flow,
A yo lyrical, biblical bad flow,
Yo yo, yo yo.
Asher D starting the show.

Wanna be wawanna be wanna be, do what I wanna do wanna do,
So Solid Crew made me realise its an outgoing fight to stay the mike,
Wanna be wawanna be wanna be, do what I wanna do wanna do,
So Solid Crew made me realise its an outgoing fight to stay the mike,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe,
When I ride the mike, make you feel the vibe.

[Chorus]
They don’t know about my crew,
They don’t know what I do,
They don’t know about my flow,
They don’t know where I go,
They don’t know about my click,
They don’t know about my s**t,
They wanna know about my doe,
But I don’t spend it let it grow.
[Repeat]

Wanna live life, bringing the family,
Wanna kick back and watch them spend money,
So niggas wanna feel when I’m hypie like say the words,
Wanna see do you recite me (what?)
Wait what would you do if you were me?
Would you scrape now away from the big heat?
Niggas wanna see niggas get rich,
But niggas don’t wanna see me to live pricey, 
Nicely, everywhere you like to live, you’d settle with me, 
Come into ma crib g,
Oh I see niggas wanna bite the dust thinking mega’s 
gonna to do his own thing g,
Back in the day, I had no luxury,
That never stopped because of ma bravery,
You get shook when you’re ne-ar me 
Asher D telling ma life story.

Spin keys make money for centuries,
Had doe and enough when I spend ma g’s,
People on ma back always wanting freebies,
Get out of ma face, 
Watch me on T.V.
Listen you don’t really wanna see me, 
When it’s dark outside and I’m angry,
I grow up wishes for girls like a genie,
I press in the car with my CD’s,
I’m stack in my car in my TT,
I’m bus big up show you wanna see me,
Danger when you’re ne-ar me, 
You can’t hear me, but you feel me.

Why d’you really wanna imitate me? – ha
Why d’you really wanna imitate me? – ha
Why is that you just wanna be me,
But you can’t see that you’re the only one to the scene.

[Chorus]
They don’t know about my crew,
They don’t know what I do,
They don’t know about my flow,
They don’t know where I go,
They don’t know about my click,
They don’t know about my s**t,
They wanna know about my doe,
But I don’t spend it let it grow.
