When it hits me what she's gone
I think I'll run for president
Get my face put on the million dollar bill

So when these rich men that she wants
Show her ways they can take care of her
I'll have found a way to be there with her still

When it hits me that she's gone
I think I'll be an astronaut
Make the moon my home
And leave the earth behind

So when she steps out into the night
And finds the light that makes her prettiest
She'll be facing me every time she shines

When it hits me that she's left me alone
When I finally move on with my life
Her goodbye written into stone
And her shadow grown into a night

When it hits me that she's gone
I think I'll be a movie star
Play the finest men the world has ever seen

So when these lovers that she's found
Show her ways they learned to talk to her
Behind each perfect word there'll be a little bit of me
