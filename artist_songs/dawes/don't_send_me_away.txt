You can send me a message if you don’t want to talk
And make sure I don’t interrupt
It might help you let it go
It’s hard for you, I know
To act like you’re not giving up

But don’t send me away
There’s nowhere else I’m going to
Don’t send me away
I know that’s what you want to do
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away

You can send me a picture of the room you’re in
With your evening downtown view
The way the city spreads
When you’re laying in your bed
You can send it so I know what I can stand to lose

But don’t send me away
This is where I’m supposed to be
Don’t send me away
You don’t know what you do to me
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away

I’m getting on the freeway
Your jacket’s in my car
Your ash is in my ashtray
And I’m there with you wherever you are

Don’t send me away
There’s nowhere else I’m going to
Don’t send me away
I know that’s what you want to do
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away
Don’t send me away
