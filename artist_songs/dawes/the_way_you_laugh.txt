I suppose we are born from our silence
But you seem to take yours with you
Like a child that refuses to bloom

You forced me to face all of your beauty
Then turned your beauty away from yourself
This road that we've taken doesn't seem to stop here
But doesn't seem to go anywhere else

And your heart rests in your chest
Like a charm 'round your neck
That you couldn't find words to refuse

And this high horse you ride
It has broken its stride
As it leads us through worlds built for you

So walk with me a little bit further
So I can find the tenderness you keep inside
God made you with a taste for the madness in love
But you confuse your gift with your pride

And I can't help you with removed that bandage
I will leave you all to yourself while you heal
As I'm learning time is a language
And it's the best way to explain how I feel

And while the magician you meet
Sweeps you off your feet
Saying he'll teach you tricks all for free

I'll be in the way that you laugh
As he cuts you in half
And holds you up for the crowds all to see

So forgive me for feeling so strongly
But I feel like we can finally agree
That true lovers always end up lonely
'Cause they know how good it could be

I've heard the men in your wake
Describe you as a snake
As you slip away when they start to wilt

But I firmly believe
You're a lot more like Eve
As she enjoys a bit of her guilt
