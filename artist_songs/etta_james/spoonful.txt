It could be a spoonful of coffee
It could be a spoonful of tea
But one little spoon of your precious love
Is good enough for me

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fight about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

It could be a spoonful of water
To save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of love from my forty five
Will save you from another man

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

It could be a spoonful of sugar
It could be a spoonful of tea
But one little spoon of your precious love
Is good enough for me

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
