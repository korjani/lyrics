Sorrow
Is the street that I'm living on
Across Pain Avenue
In a town call Moan
The people I see are sadder than me
A river of tears
Don't you know it flows by my door

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move
Oh Lord
Next door to the Blues

Memory
You can tell it in my talk
My heart hurts
Even when I walk
I cry on
A pillar made of stone
Pity is my name
And that thing called love is to blame

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh Lord
Next door to the Blues

Bittersweet
Is the food that I cook
My only joy is in a storybook
The talk I give
Every word brings a tear
Every hello
Just ends with a sad goodbye

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, Oh Lord
Next door to the Blues
