Talkin' about you a man always ready to go
Now when it comes to movin', babe you're awful slow
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

You ain't got nothing in your pockets to keep me alive
But I got something for all you men to make you cry
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

Well Davey Crokett king of the wild frontier
I'll tame him down the hell [?] he was in
Jesse James, baddest man in the land
You shoulda saw me when I had him eatin', out of my hand

Now Dillinger, the woman in red got him
Now that should teach ya about a w-o-m-a-n
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
