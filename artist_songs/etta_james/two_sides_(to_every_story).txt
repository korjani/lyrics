There's always two sides to every story
Ahh, he told me
I treated him good
Now you tell me
He was playing me for a fool

But I think you're both
Playing a silly game
Believe me, I know
I did the same

But there are always two sides
To every story, yeah
But two wrongs can't make it right

Oh, and two mistakes will only bring you heartache
And you will end up losing the fight

Oh, saw my lover with another gal
So I jumped and got myself another guy
And when I found out she meant nothing to him
All I could do was cry
(Too late, too late)
(Too late, too late)

Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
There's always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
Two sides to every story
Ahhh, you better, you better beware
And you better have faith if you care

Things aren't always like they seem to be
So take this tip from experienced me

There are always two sides
To every story, yeah
But two wrongs, two wrongs can't make a right

Oh, and two mistakes will only bring you heartache
And you both will end up losing the fight

Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
There's always my side
There's always your side
There's always his side
And always my side
