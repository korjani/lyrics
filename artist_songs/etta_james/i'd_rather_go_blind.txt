Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, 'Cry, girl.'
When I saw you and that girl walkin' out

Whoo, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no

Whoo, so you see, I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't wanna be free, no

Whoo, whoo, I was just, I was just, I was just
Sitting here thinkin' of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby,
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

Whoo, and baby, baby, I'd rather, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Whoo, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind boy
[Fade out:] Baby, baby, baby...
