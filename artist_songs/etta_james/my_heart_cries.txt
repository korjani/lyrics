I was lost in the world of dreams
Counting every star
Shining overhead it seems

I was like a shepherd boy
Searching for his lamb
Here and there and everywhere

You came, whoa yeah, you captured me
You and all your charms
Oh yes, you set me free

We kissed and the world was ours alone
And my heart cried
Oh, I love you so

Then my heart cried
Oh, I love you so

Then my heart cried
Oh, I love you so
Love you so
Love you so
