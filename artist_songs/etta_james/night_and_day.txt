Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day, day and night

Why is it so that this longing for you
Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you spent my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
