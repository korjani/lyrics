So you told all the boys that you were gonna take me out
Ya even, ya even had the nerve to make a bet, oh yes you did
That I would give in, all my love you would win
But ya haven't, you haven't won it yet

You took me for a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
Oh I'm not a pushover
You thought my love was easy to get

All of the girls think you're fine, they even call ya Romeo
Ya got'em, yeah you got'em runnin' to and fro, oh yes you have
But I don't want a one night thrill, I want a love that's for real
And I can tell by your line, yours is not the lastin' kind

You took me for a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
No I'm not a pushover
You thought that you could change my mind

Your temptin' lips, your wavy hair
Your pretty eyes with that come hither stare
It makes me weak and I start to bend
And then I stop and think again
"No, no, no don't let yourself go"
I hate to spoil your reputation, I want a true love not an invitation
And I'm hip to every word in your conversation

You took me for a pushover
Oh I'm not a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
Oh you can't push me over
Nobody's gonna push me over
Oh you're not man enough to push me over
Yeah everybody thought you was gonna push me over
