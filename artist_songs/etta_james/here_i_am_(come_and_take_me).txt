I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me baby
That makes the world go 'round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half

Our love is you and me baby
That makes the world go 'round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Squeeze me
Here I am, baby

When I'm down
I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can

But it don't take much from me
Just my cup of Joe
Oh there's love inside me
I believe there's going to be an explosion

It's tough for me, oh baby
I can do worry
Tell me all your troubles
You won't ever have to worry now

Just one more thing, ask everybody
Everybody you see, no, no
You'll find yourself lost
And alone on a darkened street

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, take me
Here I am, show me, won't you

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Won't you teach me, baby?
Won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby
