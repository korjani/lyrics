(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Yeah, that's me
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
The boys would come from miles around
With presents every day
But when they'd call on Mary
This is what she'd say

Don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Just bring me diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
Well Mary, she's a very pretty girl
I guess she was born that way
But whenever they would tell her that
This is what she'd say

Don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Come on and bring me some diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
Tough Mary, Tough Mary, Tough Mary...

Oh, don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Come on and bring me some diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

Oh, I'm tough
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Yeah, yeah I'm tough
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Ooh...
