Wait, wait! Stop the wedding!
You're just marrying her for spite
If she knew the inside story
She'd tell you what you're doing just ain't right

I know you don't wanna hurt me
So stop this madness before it starts
Revenge will only cause you regret
So don't do it, don't do it
Don't break two hearts (Don't break two hearts)

'Cause you belong to me, oh darlin'
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now
I know you feel that way to
So baby, don't do it (don't do it)
Don't do it (don't do it) Don't do it (don't do it)
Oh, don't you break two hearts
(Oh don't break two hearts)

No, no, no, baby don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't do it (don't you do it)
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)
Oh, Don't you break, don't you break two hearts
(oh don't break two hearts)
