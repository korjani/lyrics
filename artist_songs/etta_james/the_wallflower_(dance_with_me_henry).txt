(Hey Baby, What do I have to do,)
(To make you love me too,)

You've got to roll with me Henry;
(Alright baby)
Roll with me Henry;
(Don't mean maybe)
Roll with me Henry;
(Any ole time)
Roll with me Henry;
(Don't change my mind)
Roll with me Henry;
You better roll it while the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on;

While the cats are ballin,
You better stop your stallin,
It's intermission in a minute,
So you better get with it,
Roll with me Henry,
You better roll it while the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on,

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh wee,
Henry, you ain't movin me,
You better feel that boogie beat,
And get the lead out of your feet,

Roll with me Henry,
Roll with me Henry,
Roll with me Henry,
Roll with me Henry,
Roll with me Henry,
You better roll it while the rollin' is on, ...

Well I ain't teasin'
(Talk to me baby)
You better stop your freezin'
(All right, mama)
If you want romancin'
(Okay sugar)
You better learn some dancin'
(Mmm-hmm mm-hmm)
Roll with me Henry,
(All right mama)
You better roll it while the rollin' is on,
Roll on, roll on, roll on.
