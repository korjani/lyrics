Did you say, I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love

Graduation's almost here, my love
So would you teach me tonight
I must not fail, my love
Teach me tonight
