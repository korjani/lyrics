Well you can really go go go
Jumpin' fast or rockin' slow
I will see ya when the band gone blow
Now hold it, don't move it now boogie some more

I'm a good rockin' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin' daddy

I told the boys all to come and see
Just what the sandman brought to me
They stood around with a great big smile
When we start to rock n' roll they all went wild

Good rockin' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin' daddy

I'll hold you close and I'll hold you tight
You'll rock n' roll from left to right
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Rest awhile and we'll boogie some more

I'm a good rockin' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin' daddy

Good rockin' daddy
Good rockin' daddy
Good rockin' daddy
Good rockin' daddy
Good rockin' daddy
