Starlit nights
They keep me looking at your starlit eyes
The way the stars impact your crazy mind, it makes me leave everything behind.
Look above, these foolish stars think they can set the mood,
But they're not as stupid as you think,
They do it right, they shine the night so bright.

The stars that shine are ever brilliance,
It makes my heart feel so resilient,
And I'm not lying, hear the silence.

[Chorus]
I never knew that it would be so great,
Listen to the comet soar at their amazing rate.
And yeah I don't know what to do when we walk out of sight,
Except to look at all stars in this amazing night.

Starlit nights
They keep me looking at your charming eyes.
The way the stars impact your crazy mind, it makes me leave everything behind.
Maybe now, we can open up our minds to see,
And realize the things we didn't know,
Please don't pass go, just watch the ever glowing.

The stars that shine are ever brilliance,
It makes my heart feel so resilient,
And I'm not lying, hear the silence.

[Chorus]
I never knew that it would be so great,
Listen to the comets soar at their amazing rate.
And yeah I don't know what to do when we walk out of sight,
Except to look at all stars in this amazing night.

Starlit nights
They keep me looking at your starlit eyes
The way the stars impact your crazy mind, it makes me leave everything behind.

[Chorus]
I never knew that it would be so great,
Listen to the comet soar at their amazing rate.
And I don't know what to do when we walk out of sight,
Except to look at all stars in this amazing night.

[Chorus]
I never knew that it would be so grand,
Listen to the comet soar while you are holding my hand.
And yeah I don't know what to do when we walk out of sight,
Except to look at all stars in this amazing night.
