[Jesse:]
So I hopped on a train,
Three in the afternoon,
I don't know when I'm coming back,
But I hope that it's soon,
See I never thought, never thought, that I'd have to leave your side, your side.

[AJ:]
It's only physically,
But know that you will be on my mind,
Twenty four hours at a time,
'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.

[AJ:]
See she wrote me a letter,
Said the weather wasn't better,
But she said that she was doing fine,
I wanna see you face to face,
That's what she wrote to me that day,
And I knew that it was all a sign.

[Jesse:]
So I wrote back with this song,
Promise it won't be too long,
Wanna make up for all our lost time,
'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.

[Jesse:]
So I'm going through these boxes.
My life's gone off track.
'Cause it's been three years.
She hasn't written back.
But in my eyes.
She's still mine.

[AJ:]
And I know it sounds so stupid,
To be waiting this long,
But I'm still in love and I know I'm not wrong,
'Cause in my eyes,
She was mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and

No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.
