[Verse 1:]
I say right now no I won't forget it
When you said you didn't feel sparks
You made me regret it
Am I the only one who thought it was real then
Cos you did a damn good job, you had me believing.

Cos I'm addicted to the thought of you,
Can I erase this very thought of you?

[Chorus:]
Jetsetter
My heart is floating like a feather
Cos when you said we couldn't be together
I realise I didn't need you either.

So jetsetter
That's what they call me cos I didn't get her
I shoulda listened cos I knew the danger
But now I guess it's better late than never.

[Verse 2:]
Two thousand miles away, don't know what I was thinkin'
A thousand thoughts that day, my head was spinning
So should I stop this now?
Oh- I'm done with dreamin'
Cos I was dramatised
My heart it was sinking.

Oh how I wish I could go back in time
Oh how I wish I could go back this time.

[Chorus:]
Oh...!
Jetsetter
My heart is floating like a feather
Cos when you said we couldn't be together
I realise I didn't need you either.

So jetsetter
That's what they call me cos I didn't get her
I shoulda listened cos I knew the danger
But now I guess it's better late than never.

Oh oh oh oh-oh...

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]
Jetsetter
My heart is floating like a feather
Cos when you said we couldn't be together
I realise I didn't need you either.

So jetsetter
That's what they call me cos I didn't get her
I shoulda listened cos I knew the danger,
But now I guess it's better 
But now I guess it's better
But now I guess it's better.
