[Verse 1]
I'd been so strong for so long
I could handle everything
Now that you've gone through that door,
I can't see anything

Oooooohh
I swallow my pain
Oooooohh

Nothing's the same

[Chorus]
Let this come crashing down
There's no way to fix it now
We're lost in the crowd 
and our love will soon decay
Just look at the mess we've made
We both know that we can't stay

[Verse 2]
I was hoping that this would last 
I guess I was wrong
Ohh 
I planned out our future together
But now that's all gone
Ohh, oooohhh
Another mistake (another mistake)
Ooooohh
We're both to blame (we're both to blame)

So just let this come crashing down
There's no way to fix it now
We're lost in the crowd and our love will soon decay
Just look at the mess we've made
We both know that we can't stay

[Bridge]
Ohh,
Everything we ever had now is ending
I didn't wanna have to say our goodbye (didn't wanna have to say goodbye)

Baby, It's best we let this go
Trust me

[Chorus]

It's better if we just let this come crashing down
There's no way to fix it now
We're lost in the crowd and our love will soon decay
Just look at the mess we've made
We both know that we can't stay
I'm sorry but I can't stay

Just look at the mess we've made
