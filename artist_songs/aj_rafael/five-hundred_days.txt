[Verse 1]
It started off grand, and ended in ruins,
Thought you were the one, you never knew what you doing, no,
You didn't know when, to stop all of your games,
And you left me here, left me without any shame,

And so the truth came out, 
You couldn't promise me the love that I was,
Pouring out for you,
And when you went away, 
I couldn't get you out of my mind oh I was,
broken down for you,

[Chorus]
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,

Ooh

[Verse 2]
I gotta be frank; I can't imagine me with anyone other than you,
You had me feeling like my dreams came true,
You made me feel good, like no one else existed,
Like summer was here everyday of the year,
Now it's just my wishful thinking,

And so the truth came out, 

Your promised someone else the love that I was,
Pouring out for you,
And when you went away,
I couldn't get you out of my mind, 
Oh I was broken down for you,

[Chorus]
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,

Mmmm,

And there is a light, and it never goes out,
And there is a promise, and I don't mean to scream and shout,
But there is a fog, and it's blocking that light,
Gotta let you go, no use in fighting this fight,

500 days, I know it wasn't the best, 
But I won't ever forget, 
No I won't ever forget you..

500 days, I know it wasn't the best, 
But I won't ever forget, 
No I won't ever forget you..
