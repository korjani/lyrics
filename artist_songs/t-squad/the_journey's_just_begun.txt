[Boy] 
This is all about you and me 
This is how it has to be 
The dreams that we have dreamed 
The places that we want to see 
This is all about keeping on 
The light before the dawn 
The love that flows through every song 
And positivity 

Some people say that anything can happen 
That you can make it right as long as you believe 
But if the rain comes and the clouds get dampened 
Just keep on keeping on and know that you will see 

There were times we wondered 
Were we gonna go under? 
Rainbows or thunder, we didn't know 
Through the tears and the laughter 
Whether happy or sadder 
The before and the after made us all so close 
The journey isn't done 
Just look how far we've come 

[Boy] 
This is all about keeping on 
The light before the dawn 
Let me tell you one to one 
The journey's isn't done 

Some people think that they don't need direction 
Some people think that they are better on their own 
I know that we have made the right connection 
And I can see it in the way that we have shone 

There are times we doubted 
When we screamed and we shouted 
Our vision was clouded it was hard to deal 
The terrible weather somehow just made us better 
We did it together and we kept it real 
The journey isn't done 
But look how far we've come 

[Boy] 
This is all about you and me 
This is how it has to be 
Let me tell you one to one 
The journey's isn't done 

[Rap] 
No matter if it gets hard 
You know you can't forget 
Gotta take that baby step 
The best part hasn't happened yet 
Still you got to understand 
We can't get stuck in (the) sand 
Together we can make a plan 
Together we gotta do the best we can 

Some people think that life is never easy 
That you can't tough it out or make it in the end 
But when the sky is gray and wind gets breezy 
You gotta hold on tight and kn ow you've got a friend 

There were times we wondered 
Were we gonna go under? 
Rainbows or thunder, we didn't know 
Through the tears and the laughter 
Whether happy or sadder 
The before and the after made us all so close 
The journey isn't done 
Just look how far we've come
