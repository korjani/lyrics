You know when you're close you really turn me on
Thats why I want you so bad when your gone, yeah
Come on, come on and take me home
Please stay with me and don't you leave me alone

You drive me wild
Yeah yeah
You know you do
Uh huh
You drive me wild
You know I need you

You're on my mind always my one desire
Lets get together and build us a fire
Make me tremble make me shake
Pleasin' each other rockin' till daybreak 

You drive me wild
Yeah yeah
You know you do
Uh huh
You drive me wild
You know I need you

Don't hold off do it, I need your lovin'
I'm getting so hot I'm cooking like an oven
My head is all filled with crazy thoughts
Love like this just can't be bought 

You drive me wild
Yeah yeah
You know you do
Uh huh
You drive me wild
You know I need you
