Wild in the streets, barely alive
Mama's always telling me stay inside
Don't you hang around with those young boys
Soon you'll be lovin' them
They're all night toys

I wanna be where the boys are
I wanna fight how the boys fight
I wanna love how the boys love
I wanna be where the boys are

Hot love hear, I got the drive
Neighbours been bugging me I gotta hide
I am the bitch with the hot guitar
I am the air, the sun and stars

I wanna be where the boys are
I wanna fight how the boys fight
I wanna love how the boys love
I wanna be where the boys are

Wild in the streets, barely alive
Mama's always telling me stay inside
Don't you hang around with those young boys
Soon they'll be loving you with all their joy

I wanna be where the boys are
I wanna fight how the boys fight
I wanna love how the boys love
I wanna be where the boys are
