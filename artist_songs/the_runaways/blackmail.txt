You didn't care you went and broke my heart
I'll get ya back you know it's gonna start
You gave me pain thats whatcha done to me
When I get through you'll be sorry you met me

You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay
For the life that you tore
Blackmail
Black
Mail 

You put it to me and now we'll play my game
I'll wrap you up and you'll go insane
It took so long and I waited my turn
You pay your debt I'm gonna make you burn you know 

You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay
For the life that you tore
Blackmail
Black
Mail

I know about you and I'm gonna tell
The way I planned you're gonna go through hell
Now you listen to what I'm about to say
Or you won't live to see the light of day, you know
