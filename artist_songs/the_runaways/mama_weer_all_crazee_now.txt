I don't want to drink my whiskey like you do 
I don't need to spend my money but still do 
Don't stop now, come on 
Another drop now, come on 
I wanna lot now, so come on 
That's right, that's right 

I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 

You told me, fool fire water won't hurt me 
You tease me, and everybody deserts me 
Don't stop now, come on 
Another drop now, come on 
I wanna lot now, so come on 
That's right, that's right 

I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 

I don't want to drink my whiskey, but still do 
I don't need to spend my money but still do 
Don't stop now, come on 
Another drop now, come on 
I wanna lot now, so come on 
That's right, that's right 

I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now 
I said mama but weer all crazee now
