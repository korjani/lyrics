In the dead of the night I slip away
Lookin' for some heavy action
No matter what it is, I get that little itch
My body needs satisfaction

Gotta get out tonite
The wild one is callin' me
Gotta get out tonite
Out on the town is where I'll be alright

My folks think I'm bad and you know
They're probably right
But I don't listen to a thing they say
But I don't listen to a thing they say
Cause They're always uptight

My fantasy is strong, it really turns me on
I'm gettin' oh so wet
When will I discover my red hot lover
The one I'll never forget

Gotta get out tonite
The wild one is callin' me
Gotta get out tonite
Out on the town is where I'll be alright
