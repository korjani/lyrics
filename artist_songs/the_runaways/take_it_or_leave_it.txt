You know that I'm not an angel
I told you when you walked in the door
You know that you make me happy
Better than the time before

Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me

You know that you're just a playmate
What are you trying to gain
Lead me into the darkness
To Play our little nightime games

Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me

You say you wanna be with me
I see it in you
It's only a one night stand
And then we're through

You know that it makes me sad
To see how you feel for me
I gotta start movin' on
Someone else is waitin' for me

Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me
