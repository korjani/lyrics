With every beat of my heart, it's getting dark
There's something in the air
The doors aren't locked, you know it's not
But I just know you're somewhere
Hands on the table, are they empty got a fable
Is it true?
Say he's coming, no one said a word
They've gotten through

It's such a crush, it's getting hot
Temperature's rising it's getting hot

Shot a single word for telling true
I can hear him pant
I wanna leave but I just can't breathe free
If they begin their chant

It's such a crush, it's getting hot
Temperature's rising it's getting hot

Church is breaking, my body's shaking
I just can't tell
He's coming back my head is black
He must be under a spell

It's such a crush, it's getting hot
Temperature's rising it's getting hot
