Don't turn away, I know you feel it
If you want me love, you don't have to steal it
Your eyes they beg
The tears you fashion up
Gonna get involved in the nature of love

C'mon, C'mon
You know you make me want you
C'mon, oh c'mon

It's getting late, we made a start now
I can't talk about that love anyhow
Your eyes are wide, your body's shakin'
I got the hives my soul is achin'

C'mon, C'mon
You know you make me want you
C'mon, oh c'mon

Hot throat, to race this love I have
You're one of a kind, don't want no other
Love is your thing you keep my style
Clean me out with an easy smile

C'mon, C'mon
You know you make me want you
C'mon, oh c'mon
