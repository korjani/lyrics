I met you last nite, it was really alright
We got along
We partied awhile, you gave me the smile
Nothin' went wrong
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright

Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!

The very next day, you saw us play
It was really a kick
Drippin' in sweat, I got very wet, honey
You did the trick
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright

Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!

I stayed the nite, it was really alright
I need our heat
I got kinda cold, you got really bold
Ya said, "Come to me."
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright

Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!
