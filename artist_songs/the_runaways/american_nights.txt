Clean rock n roll
Makes the midnight flow tonight now
It's hot tonight
Come on let's have a good time
In the dark of the night
We hunt for fun
Chasing after the moonlight
Hiding from the sun

American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change

Our magic is young
Cause we just begun
We light up the sky
Always on the run
We live in the streets
In the alleys of screams
Cause we're the queens of noise
The answer to your dreams

American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change

Hey boy you're my good time
Dance close ya feel so fine
Hold tight we're on fire
All night you're my desire

Everybody
Wanna party
Everybody
Wanna party

American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change
