Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields 
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hungabout 
Strawberry Fields forever 

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see 
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter much to me 
Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields 
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hungabout 
Strawberry Fields forever 

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low 
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right, that is I think it's not too bad 

Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields 
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hungabout 
Strawberry Fields forever 

Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream 
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree 

Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields 
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hungabout 
Strawberry Fields forever 
Strawberry Fields forever 
Strawberry Fields forever
