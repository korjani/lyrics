Night visions of fantasies
Are laying in bed with me
In the dark I can see you smiling
You touch my body and set my soul on fire
Oh yeh

I can see morning light
The sun is rising, shining in your eyes
Suddenly you're gone
And I'm left here all alone
Oh yeh

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh

I know you're here
I can feel your presence
And that sound you're making
It's getting me so hot
Oh yeh

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh
