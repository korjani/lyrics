My one and only shining star said
Stick with me and I'll take you far
Your eyes are sparkling with teenage fire
I'll satisfy your mad desires cause

I love playing with fire
And I don't wanna get burned
I love playing with fire
And I don't think I'll ever learn

My heart is aching to see you play
And I can't wait till another day
The way you shake me is really hot
You know how to use what you got

I love playing with fire
And I don't wanna get burned
I love playing with fire
And I don't think I'll ever learn

Acting tough with looks that kill
You got me going and I can't stand still
My arms are dying to hold ya tight
You're my little dark dynamite you know

I love playing with fire
And I don't wanna get burned
I love playing with fire
And I don't think I'll ever learn
