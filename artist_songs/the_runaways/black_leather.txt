Ooh, 
Well, he's all geared up, walkin' down the street 
I can see the slime, drippin' down his sleeve 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do

Ooh, 
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone 
I can hear the boots gettin' near her home 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, he's clawing at the door 
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore 
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore, 
I never should have asked for black leather 
Black leather, black leather, black leather

You can try to hide, you know you won't get far 
You let him in, and you'll start again 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do 
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door 
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore 
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore, 
I never should asked for black leather 
Black leather, black leather, black leather
