Bitch, lil bitch

Young nigga just been waiting
Your bitch Uber on the way - patience
I came with the water
I done slid upon your daughter

Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, bitch
Voot up voot up

Sucky bloody bitch I'm Jack in the [?]
Poppin' acid while I'm in the Mercedes
Fuck these bitches, bitch I'm all 'bout my payment
Flow so hard like it was born from the pavement
And she give me toppy sloppy like Joe
Mop that pussy - water wet like the floor
Like a password bitch I go buy the code
Coca yielding, play in her nose
Hey, I just wanna sit up on that propeller boat
Hey, I just wanna rap and ship it coast to coast
Hey, smoking on fruity, call it the cantaloupe
Hey, made your bitch come here without a fucking rope
Hey, that bitch not an animal but got camel toe
Hey, I slurp it, I spoon her just like some Danimals
Hey, she poppin' for daddy now where her panties go
Hey, a nigga leaning like the Pisa Tower hoe

Young nigga just been waiting
Your bitch Uber on the way - patience
I came with the water
I done slid upon your daughter

Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, splash, splash
Splash, splash, splash, splash

Chain on me swang like a swing, swing
I just be doing my thing, thing
Johnny Dang my jewelry bling, bling
Like I'm Jordan, need a ring, ring
Pussy glazed , no Krispy Kreme, Kreme
Fuck a triple, need a beam, beam
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean, Clean
Bathing Ape or with the 'Preme
Bad lil bitch she a gook
When she she pop a xanny she don't give no attitude
She tryna suck my dick under water right in the pool
She told me it was easy, I told her lil baby vool
Let's get it
Gripping on her neck like a noose
Dirty daughter pull up like a Panamera coupé
Told her splash down and she wet like soup
Told her find the booth, blunts laced no boof
Boot up, pockets on fat just like a Buddha
Pull up on your hoe up on a scooter
It's Mr. Freeze no cooler
Apple iwatch with the ruler
Mosh pit throwing balls luda
Fender bender call me Larry Hoover
Boot up, boot up, boot up, tell 'em voot up
Hash Sling Slasher your medulla
