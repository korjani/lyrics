Aye, water that pussy like Baptist
Too far my sauce need an atlas
Her pussy hungry and starving so my dick is what I use, I use it as catnip
Rap game on faster than Passover be real on these niggas I might overlap them
Never mind, I just might cap them
Just like a taser I zap them
Shot, I fuck a bitch in the dark
My diamonds shine in the dark
Weed deadass smell like a fart
I'ma go just like a cart
You police, I'll call you Paul Blart
Try but you never can fuck my thot
Or milly rock on my block
Okay, Post Malone with that pistol
I see you as dead tissue
I know that you hard as tissues
See you giggle like tickle
Your bitch seeking me like missile
Heat Sensor my pickle
You know I don't tell no riddle
Rope around money like a reel

Map, map, map
Kilos that I have I blow cash cash
Put them in the field like baseball bat
And I'm fresher off a lick like a whole Tic-Tac
You done fucked up like you Take A Step Back
Cool cat like a stray in a freezer in the back
Like you're Jay-Z no Roc-A-Fella holla back
But I'm 'bout the damn money boomerang back
Like lisp, this how I speak 'cause I sip
Meanwhile bust under your bitch
In your mouth I fit a fist
Pistol backstrapped with my hip
Like T.I. ya bitch as a tip
I don't get head I get lip
The sauce is water, I dripped
The sauce is water, I-
