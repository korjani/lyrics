Maybe, there I was 
Waiting for a chance 
Hoping that you'll understand 
The things I wanna say 

As my love went stronger than before 
I wanna see you more and more 
But you closed your door 
Why don't you try 
To open up your heart 
I won't take so much of your time 

Maybe, it's wrong to say please love me too 
'Cause I know you'll never do 
Somebody else is waiting there inside for you 
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day 
'Cause I know he's here to stay 
But I know to whom you should belong 

I believed what you said to me 
We should set each other free 
That's how you want it to be 

But my love went stronger than before 
I wanna see you more and more 
But you closed your door 
Why don't you try to open up your heart 
I won't take so much of your time 

Maybe, it's wrong to say please love me too 
'Cause I know you'll never do 
Somebody else is waiting there inside for you 
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day 
'Cause I know he's here to stay 
But my love is strong 
I don't know if this is wrong 
But I know to whom you should belong 

Maybe, it's wrong to say please love me too 
'Cause I know you'll never do 
Somebody else is waiting there inside for you 
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day 
'Cause I know he's here to stay 
But my love is strong 
I don't know if this is wrong 
But I know to whom you should belong
