In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart I know

Love will find a way
Anywhere I go
I'm home, if you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you they'll know

Love will find a way
Anywhere we go
We're home
If we are there together
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way
I know
Love will find a way
