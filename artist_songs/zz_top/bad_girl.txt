See that girl with the red dress on,
she can do it all night long,
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
I know a girl that likes to flirt,
she can do it in a mini skirt.
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,
it's enough to drive you mad.

Yesterday I was playin' it cool
but she played me for a first class fool,
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
I'm gonna tell you like I told some friends
I'm goin' back to dig her again.
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,
it's enough to drive you mad.

I know a girl with a GTO,
she's the one that go cat go,
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
See the girl dressed in green,
she's the one that's a mean machine,
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,
it's enough to drive you mad.
