When I hear that Santa Fe start blowin'
I wonder where it's been and where it's goin'.

I tell you, boy, every time
the feelin' sure is fine.
Just move me on down the line,
just move me on down the line.

Then I heard Red Rooster start his crowin'
around the curve that cloud of smoke was blowin'.

I tell you, boy, every time
the feelin' sure is fine.
Just move me on down the line,
just move me on down the line.

I'll be where the big wheels keep on turnin'
and the diesel drivers keep them engines burnin'.

I tell you, boy, every time
the feelin' sure is fine.
Just move me on down the line,
just move me on down the line.

Move me on down the line, move me on down.
Move me on down the line, move me on down.
