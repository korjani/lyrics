RED, RED LIPS
SWIVELIN' HIPS
MOVIN' IN SOME NEW BLUE JEANS
SHUFFLIN' SWEET RIGHT WITH THAT BEAT
SHE CAN REALLY SHAKE THAT THING

BELT BUCKLE
SHININ' DAY AND NIGHT
WHEN SHE SHAKE THAT THING
HOPE IT'S NEXT TO MINE

I SAID, LORD HAVE MERCY, MY O' MY
YOU BEEN LOOKIN' TOO GOOD
I THINK YOU WANNA SHAKE WITH ME
BABY I THINK YOU SHOULD

BELT BUCKLE
SHININ' DAY AND NIGHT
WHEN YOU SHAKE THAT THING
HOPE IT'S NEXT TO MINE

PLEASE, PLEASE BABY, I WANNA SAY
YOU LOOKIN' SO FINE
AND IF YOU HOLD MINE NEXT TO YOURS
I'LL HOLD YOU NEXT TO MINE

BELT BUCKLE
SHININ' DAY AND NIGHT
WHEN YOU SHAKE THAT THING
HOPE IT'S NEXT TO MINE
