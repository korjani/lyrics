Rumour spreadin' a-'round in that Texas town
'bout that shack outside La Grange 
and you know what I'm talkin' about.
Just let me know if you wanna go 
to that home out on the range.
They gotta lotta nice girls.

Have mercy.
A haw, haw, haw, haw, a haw.
A haw, haw, haw.

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
and the ten to get yourself in. 
A hmm, hmm.
And I hear it's tight most ev'ry night,
but now I might be mistaken.
hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

Have mercy.
