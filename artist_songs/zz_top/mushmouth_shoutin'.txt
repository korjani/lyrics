You know I'm wild about you, baby,
been keepin' me from my sleep at night.
You know I'm hung up on you, little doll,
you just don't treat your daddy right.

You know you crazy when you get drunks, you be talkin' all out your head.
You're acting mighty strange about me, sayin' those things you said.
I'm just wild about you, baby,
been keepin' me from my sleeps at night.
You know I'm hung up on you, little darlin',
you just don't treat your daddy right, oh yeah.

D'ya know I came home last night and I looked down on the floor,
I saw a fine pair of alligators, somethin' I never had before.
But I'm wild about you, baby,
been keepin' me from my sleeps at night.
You know I'm hung up on you, little darlin',
you just don't treat your daddy right.

Said, now honey if you don't stop messin' round with me,
try'n to make me out a dumbbell, somethin' I ain't never gonna be.
I'm still wild about you, baby,
you been keepin' me from my sleeps at night.
You know I'm hung up on you, little doll,
but you just don't treat your daddy right.
