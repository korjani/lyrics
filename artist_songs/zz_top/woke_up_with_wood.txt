When I woke up this morning
I was feeling mighty good.
My baby understood had to do what she should
lying near a pile of wood.
Laying it on some,
playing with it some
when I, I woke up with wood.

I was lying there thinking 'bout basketball
trying not to lose my mind
my baby came to help and I let out a yell,
she grabbed me from behind.
Laying on it some,
playing with it some
when I, I woke up with wood.

Beauty queens fall in trances,
debutantes lose their furs.
But it felt so good from where they stood,
they were working on a pile of wood.
Laying on it some,
playing with it some
when I, I woke up with wood.
