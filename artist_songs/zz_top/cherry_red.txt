Strange things goin' through my head.  Oh!
Crazy things that I think she said.
Slides so slinky that it's gotta be real.
she just wanna know how to feel.
Cherry red, cherry red
She just wanna feel cherry red.
Cherry red, cherry red
She just wanna feel cherry red.
This town of killer tits is doing me in.
Tried to leave once wanna do it again.
But this one little thing's such a thoroughbred.
I'm addicted to the feel of her cherry red.
Cherry red, cherry red
Addicted to the feel of her cherry red.
Cherry red, cherry red
I wanna keep thinkin' 'bout cherry red.
Whip out a bottle of your favorite rave
I think you better tend to your cherry crave
Ain't nothin' stupid what we're talking about
Take a little twist and then you pour it on out
Cherry red, cherry red
Think you better tend to your cherry red.
Cherry red, cherry red
I think you better give me that cherry red.
