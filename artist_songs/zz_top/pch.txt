I was out on the coastline
Getting a little shake
Do it every day
for mercy sake
Sometime surf's up
Sometimes it's flat
Eatin' up asphalt
Prowlin' like a tomcat
Stunned at what I see
Should I stay or should I leave
Too much, not enough PCH
Too much, not enough PCH
Feelin' kind of free
By the deep blue sea
A true blood blue slud
Hangin' on me
Wanna head north
But I might go south
Can't make up my mind
Cause I'm thinking like Brian
I'm hangin' in and out
I'm pullin' up cause it's about
Too much, not enough PCH
Too much, not enough PCH
