Well, I knocked down on your door, baby,
to see if you were at home.
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound
but something told me you weren't alone.
What in the world can a nasty dog do
but try to get next to you?

Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny.
Look how it happened to me.
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too
and it'd leave you in misery.
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do
but to try to get next to you.

Mm, well.
