Deep in the South of Texas
not so long ago,
there on a crowded island
in the Gulf of Mexico

it didn't take too much money,
man, but it sure was nice.
You could dance all night if you felt all right,
drinking whiskey and throwing dice.

And everybody knows
it was hard to leave.
And everybody knows
it was down at the Balinese.

Yeah, I remember Ruby,
she always dressed in red
wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance
with a rag wrapped around her head.

And everybody knows
it was hard to leave.
And everybody knows
it was down at the Balinese.

And everybody knows
it was hard to leave.
And everybody knows
it was down at the Balinese,
it was down at the Balinese,
it was down at the Balinese.
