I know you wanna be my bedroom thang,
but you're much too young.
You're the finest thing I've ever seen.
You just wanna have fun.

I need someone who can scratch my back.
I need someone who can carry my pack.
I need someone to be with me at night.
You're gonna make me feel alright.

Don't you bother me with petty lines,
I know you ran away from home.
This might come to you as some surprise,
I wish you'd leave me alone.

I need someone to scratch my back.
I need someone to carry my pack.
I need someone to be with me at night.
You're gonna make me feel alright.
