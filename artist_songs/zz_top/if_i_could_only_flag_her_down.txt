I don't need her money
I don't need a ride
I got enough connections
I don't need a piece of her hide

I just wanna please her
I just wanna squeeze her
I just wanna crash her
I just wanna trash her
If I could only flag her down
if I could only flag her down

Well, it's not because of her beauty 
and her brand new low cut blouse.
It's not because she's so snooty 
or a fine famed millionaire.

It's not 'cause she's in motion 
In a brand new Cadillac car
It's not because of her lotion
She's a real sweet candy bar

I just want to meet her
I just want to squeeze her
I just want to crash her
I just want to trash her
If I could only flag her down!
if I could only flag her down!
