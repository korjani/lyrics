Got a girl, her name's Francine,
finest thing you ever seen.
And I love her, she's all that I want.
And I need her, she's all that I need.

Well, Francine, oh Francis, why
do you love me and make me cry?
How I love her, she's all that I want.
How I need her, she's all that I need.

If I ever caught her with Stevie P
I'd throw her back in the Penitentiary, now.
And if I caught her with my mother's son
I'll call her daddy and get my gun.

My Fancine just turned thirteen,
she's my angelic teenage queen.
And I love her, she's all that I want.
And I need her, she's all that I need.
And I love her, she's all that I want.
And I need her, she's all that I need.
And I love her, she's all that I want.
And I need her, she's all that I need.
