I met a shiek from Mozambique
who led me to the Congo.
He dreamed to go to Mexico
and sample a burrito.

My temperature had risen again,
it must have been a hundred and ten.

Under the oaks I was telling some jokes
and thinkin' I had it made-
Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke
and coolin' off in the shade.

My temperature had risen again,
and it must have been a hundred and ten.

I took a boat that couldn't float
to Rio de Janeiro.
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba
but I'll be gone tomorrow.

My temperature had risen again,
it must have been a hundred and ten.
