Big shiny nine she's mine all mine
Flowin down the front of my old blue jeans
Big shiny nine she'll fall so fine
Waitin to impress my hippie queen

It's all right now
I'm fingering my big black shiny nine
Sticks and stones
Skeleton bones
Enough to make the dead jump and run
Encyclopedia ain't got what I need
Cause I'm waiting my to undress my hippie queen

It's all right now
I'm fingering my big black shiny nine
Nuts and bolts
Smith and wesson and colts
It's down to luger can't make a selection
Stealin steeds and film
Scrapin bottom again

Oh lord I'm headed in a direction
It's all right now
My shiny nine I have my shiny nine
It's all right now
I'm fingering my big black shiny nine
