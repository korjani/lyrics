Well how much blues do you use 
Before you use it up
And how many fools take a chance
Before they hit it lucky
Tomorrow's wanna be the day 
It never seem to work that way

What's up with that 
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that

Everybody want a little more 
Than they think they got
But what you might think it is,
Might really not be, baby
Pick it up or leave it lay
It always seem to slip away

What's up with that 
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that

Now how high will a river get
Before it overflows
And how long is the hole to China
It don't really know
This is what it's all about
There's always gonna be a doubt

What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that
