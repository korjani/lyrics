You want to race?
If you insist.
At that price, I can't resist,
That's right, that's right, that's right.

Tonight it ain't right,
I got to have me a week.
But I'll be back for you, Jack,
and I'll let the machine speak,
That's right, that's right, that's right.

Showdown, you bet.
And I haven't saddled my pony yet.
Have mercy, Miss Percy.
I done put the coon tune on this bet, 
That's right, that's right, that's right.
