I went down to dock number ten
to see what just came in.
They seemed a little bit mysterious,
I think I'm gonna get delirious.
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS

I got nailed in a raid last night,
they tried to haul me off to jail.
Things were looking kind of serious
till everybody got delirious.
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS

I fell into a hand of cards
and almost blew the night away.
Things were looking kind of furious
till everybody got delirious.
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS

I overloaded and I saw the light,
decadence was on my mind.
Everything was getting ridiculous
till everybody get delirious.
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS
