She used to drive a beat up pickup
Down around San Antone
Stealin' the heart of every guy in town
Includin' the one I own
But this sweet young thing of seventeen
Would sting you with the lovesick blues
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin
Lookin' for someone to use

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs

Well I heard she got down in Beaumont
And she wound up in El Paso
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail
And she could step to the cotton eyed Joe
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy
Slip in and get her while you can
Cause before too long she'll be good as gone
And runnin' with another man

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs
