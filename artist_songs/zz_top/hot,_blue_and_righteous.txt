Hot, blue and righteous,
an angel called me aside.
Hot, blue and righteous,
said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guide."

I heard the words as I closed my eyes
down on my, down on my bended knees.
It fit like a glove and I realized
somethin' good's happenin' to me.

Hot, blue and righteous
angel called me aside.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
