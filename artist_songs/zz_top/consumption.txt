Ain't gonna find me here
Consumption
Ain't gonna find me here
I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no nothing no feel

Consumption
I get down on me knees
Consumption
I get down on that knee
I seem to be mistreatin' killin' me by degrees

Consumption
Pour me one you please
Consumption
Pour me one you please
A run on the honkey tonk makes that one for free

Have another bottle
Make me who I wanna be
Have another bottle
Make me who I wanna be
Have another bottle
Make me who I wanna be
