When I woke up this mornin' 
had a smile run across my face.
My baby from town just had to get down, 
come and drag me all over the place.

Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck
down on highway fifty-nine.
I had the blues and my baby, she knew
she's holdin' little piece of mind.

Down brownie, 
my brownie downtown,
down brownie.

Got my share and I'm a black hand cottonfield
just to try and keep myself alive.
Eatin' red beans and rice with the right sauce, it's nice
or anything you wanna try.

Now I'm hitchin' a ride back from Brownie's,
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright.
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings,
I'll be flyin' into Houston tonight.
