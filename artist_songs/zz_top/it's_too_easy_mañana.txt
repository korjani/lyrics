Just a one room country shack,
Lyin' here on my rack.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
Bootleg whiskey, feeling fine.
It's good reason out of mind.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
Oh this life is such a scene,
Ain't no worry mo manana.

I don't care maybe if I could.
Deal the shuffle in the cards,
Don't have to work that hard.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

Now if I sleep out in the rain
I would call my ball and chain.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
Will you miss me? I'm all wrong,
You hardly know I'm gone.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
I spent bad luck times in jail,
I've been blowing out spitting nails.

I pack my sack and vanish when I could.
From my one room funky shack,
Better roll with me jack.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
