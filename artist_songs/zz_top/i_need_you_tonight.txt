It's three o'clock in the morning
and the rain begin to fall
but I know what I'm needin
but I don't have it all.
I'm needin someone like you
that I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.

Outside my window
it's lonely and cold.
Inside my heart there's a fire
burning out of control.
Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.

Your love's coming to me
like a wolf howling at the moon
but that just doesn't do me
if I can't get you soon.
I'm calling for someone like you
that I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.
