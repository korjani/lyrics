Chartreuse
You got the color that turns me loose
Chartreuse
That color just turns me loose
Better than Magenta
Better than Fuse
You got a shade that gets rid of the blues.

Chartreuse
Don't you know I like big Caboose
Chartreuse
You know I like that big Caboose
Its sure sweet,
Lights my fuse
Its sure sweet,
Lights my fuse

[Guitar Solo]

Chartreuse
That color just turns me loose
Chartreuse
You got the color that turns me loose

You got the blues baby
I got the juice
You got the blues baby
I got the juice

[Outro Solo]
