Goin' to a party in the county jail,
Prison band was there and they began to wail.
Kid is shakin' and began to sing;
You should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing.
Let's rock!  Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.

Spider Murphy sittin' on a block of stone;
Little Joey blowin' on a slide trombone.
Come on, Silly Willy, don't you be no square.
If you cannot find a partner, use a wooden chair.
Let's rock!  Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.    

Shifty Henry said to Bugs,"For heaven's sake,
No one's lookin'; now's our chance to make a break."
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix.  I
Wanna stick around awhile and get my kicks."
Let's rock!  Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.
