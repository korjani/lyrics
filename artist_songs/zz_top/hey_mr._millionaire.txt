I WENT DOWN ACROSS THAT BORDERLINE
DOWN IN THE PLANET MEXICO
BOUGHT SOME TEQUILA
BIG SACK O' WHACK
I LET GO OF TH' PESO I COULDN'T GET BACK

HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION
CAN YOU LOAN THIS PO' BOY A DIME?

I WALKED DOWN ACROSS THE BORDERLINE
WAY OVER PLANET LONDON
BOUGHT A ROLLS ROYCE AN' A JAGUAR
IT'S DOESN'T NOT MATTER HOW RICH YOU ARE

HEY MR. MILLIONIARE, HEY MR. MILLION
CAN YOU LOAN THIS PO' BOY A DIME?

I MOVED ON ACROSS THAT BORDERLINE
DEEP OFF TH' PLANET LOUISIANA
THREW SOME DICE
IT WAS OH SO NICE
BUT IT LEFT ME EATIN' RED BEANS AND RICE

HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION
COULD YOU LOAN THIS PO' BOY A DIME?
HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION
LOAN THIS PO' BOY A DIME
LOAN THIS PO' BOY A DIME

TURN YOURSELF INTO A BANKER
