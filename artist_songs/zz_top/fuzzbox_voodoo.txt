I went down with the fuzzbox
Grinding a pound or two
Say I'm down, with a fuzzbox
Pounding and a workin' it through
And because you've got fuzz
Go on and do what you wanna do
I down down with a fuzzbox
Checking out what it could do
It was step-2, blue voodoo
Fuzzed another hour or two
Just do it man

Now lay down on your hot spot
Listen what I'm tellin' you
Said leand down witchu hot spot
Hit chu with the blue voodoo
Just do it dude
Everybody do
Once it's understood
