Old 61's my number on the highway
I'm turning up the V's on the airways
I'm tuned into some bad-ass transactions
It's the only way to get my satisfaction
Yeah antenna head, yeah antenna head
Antenna waves be burnin' up my radio
Mister Deejay say it's the only way to go
Cranked up all the way my tube is turning red
Got a pocket full off cornbread just call it
Antenna head
Yeah antenna head
Yeah antenna head
Yeah yeah yeah antenna head
Yeah antenna head
