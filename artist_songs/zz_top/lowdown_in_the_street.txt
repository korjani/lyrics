Well there comes Lola, out of control-a:
She just loves those rhythm and blues.
And miss Ivy will be arriving;
in leopard skin tights she's willing to cruise.

It's a fiend scene and it happens 'bout once a week.
So fork over some bread, it'll do your head to get low down in the street.

There's Jimmy and Jojo, there's Kim and Keith,
Way outside the eyes of cool.
And sweet M.B., and there's little G.B.
Everybody wants to be their fool.

It's a fiend scene and it happens here ev'ry week.
Fork over some bread, it'll do your head to get low down in the street.

Some nights are lonely, some nights are lazy,
but ain't nobody try and slip away.
They'll make you loose.  They'll make you crazy.
Know what I mean, what you say, what you say.

It's a fiend scene and it happens 'bout once a week.
So roam on in, it ain't no sin to get low down in the street.
