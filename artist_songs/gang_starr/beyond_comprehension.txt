Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
that some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
you with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get?  You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn...) this jam's beyond comprehension

Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
for a person to just flip, so a brother may
simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song... that's beyond comprehension
