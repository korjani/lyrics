Going about my mind for one girl
There's not one thing in the whole wide world
I wouldn't do for the girl next door

She's not too pretty, you know she's sweet
[?] knocks me off my feet
And I know she's just the girl next door

Why do you try so hard to hide your feelings?
(Oh, the girl next door)
Please tell me how it feels inside
(Oh, the girl next door)
Just let yourself go and you'll realize
It's all for real, can you tell me how?

So remember how it used to be
And now you're there holding it back on me
And I know that you're the girl next door

I told you I'd be back one day
We all grow different, you're still the same
And I know that you're still the girl next door

Why do you try so hard to hide your feelings?
(Oh, the girl next door)
Please tell me how it feels inside
(Oh, the girl next door)
Just let yourself go and you'll realize
It's all for real, tell me how to [?]

So, why won't you hold me?
Just for a little while
Why won't you kiss me?
I think I know how she'd feel, yeah

So remember how it used to be
And now that you're there holding it back on me
And I know that you're the girl next door

I told you I'd be back one day
We all grow different, you're still the same
And I know that you're still the girl next door

Why do you try so hard to hide your feelings?
(Oh, the girl next door)
Please tell me how it feels inside
(Oh, the girl next door)
Just let yourself go and you'll realize
It's all for real, can you tell me how it feels?

She's the girl next door
Talking about the girl next door
She's just the girl next door

The girl next door
The girl next door
She's just the girl next door

I want the girl next door
I need the girl next door
I love the girl next door
