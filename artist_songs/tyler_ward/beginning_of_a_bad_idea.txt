Comfortable like an old sweater
Memorable, you just can’t forget her
Starting over is the hardest thing to do
History has a way of repeating
Eventually we’ll just do the same thing
Starting over is impossible with you

[Chorus:]
So don’t pick up anymore
When I call you up
Cause it’s the beginning
Of a bad idea
A bad idea

Loneliness has a way of magnifying this
Feeling that I‘m still not, no I’m not over you

[Chorus:]
So don’t pick up anymore
When I call you up
Cause it’s the beginning
Of a bad idea
A bad idea

I’m still in love with you
Guess I’ll love you from a distance

[Chorus:]
So don’t pick up anymore
When I call you up
Cause it’s the beginning
Of a bad idea
A bad idea
