Last night, under city lights
I was wandering
Across the street, he stared at me
7 feet, a trench coat angel
Through a smokey haze, he looked my way
And said, could I have minute please?
I have got something you need

Don't be afraid to make mistakes
At least you know you're livin
The debts and pain, from when you strayed 
Well man, all's forgiven
All's forgiven

I've seen it all, the rise and fall
Ten thousand years of living
From Rome to Spain, Berlin, L.A 
People still pretending
You fight your wars, but what's it for
Trust me, they're never ending
You better wake up, the end is your beginning

Don't be afraid to make mistakes
At least you know you're livin
The debts and pain, from when you strayed 
Well man, all's forgiven
All's forgiven

Love, it is enough
When it comes to us
Let's make it right

Love, it is enough
When it comes to us
We'll make it right

Love, it is enough
When it comes to us
We'll make it right
