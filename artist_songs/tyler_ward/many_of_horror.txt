You say "I love you, boy"
I know you lie
I trust you all the same
I don't know why
'Cause when my back is turned
My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale
So hard to hide
I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard
Sitting in a wishing hole
Hoping it stays dry
Feet cast in solid stone
I've got Gilligan's eyes
I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard
You said love was letting us go against what
Our future is for...
Many of horror
Our future's for many of horror
I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard
