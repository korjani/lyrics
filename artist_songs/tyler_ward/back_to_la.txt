Was it something I said or something I did to you
Was I out of my head or was there just someone new

[Pre-Chorus:]
You hear them say, "You’ll never know until
She’s gone away"
Today it’s my turn
Now I know the heart can break in two

[Chorus:]
All I’ll send is a simple text that says
I miss you and the way we kiss
I can’t get your taste up off my lips
So come back to LA
I know that I won’t forget you quick
Hope I’m the one you always miss
If you can’t get my taste up off your lips
Then come back to LA

We were dreaming in red this must be our big mistake
Cause forever was said, not "Hello. Love. Heartbreak."

[Pre-Chorus:]
You hear them say, "You’ll never know until
She’s gone away"
Today it’s my turn
Now I know the heart can break in two

[Chorus:]
All I’ll send is a simple text that says
I miss you and the way we kiss
I can’t get your taste up off my lips
So come back to LA
I know that I won’t forget you quick
Hope I’m the one you always miss
If you can’t get my taste up off your lips
Then come back to LA

We were dancing on the rooftop
Underneath the rain drops
Whispering baby don’t you ever stop
So come back to LA

[Chorus:]
All I’ll send is a simple text that says
I miss you and the way we kiss
I can’t get your taste up off my lips
So come back to LA
I know that I won’t forget you quick
Hope I’m the one you always miss
If you can’t get my taste up off your lips
Then come back to LA

I found out you’re harder to forget
You’re the one I always seem to miss
If you come around when you’re back in town
Just say hello cause I’ve always been in love with you
And I wasn’t meant to miss you
