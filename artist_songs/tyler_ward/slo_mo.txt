Stop. Pause. Take a minute
Let this bring you back to a place that you remember
We were young, cool, naive
Hair was blowing backwards the California breeze
I was smiling back at you as you were looking back at me
Driving Santa Monica your hand upon my knee
And I was kissing you
Wasn't missing you
Do you remember too

[Chorus:]
I remember talking in the dark
Until we saw the sunlight
Girl we had a spark
We let go
Underneath the stars
Drinking up the moon light
Taking our time
Living in slow motion, slow motion

Didn't learn the lessons that they taught us back in school
Fell in love with taking chances so we broke all of the rules
And I never knew the meaning of, "I've got something to lose"
Till I lost you, I lost you

[Pre-Chorus:]
So come on baby
Let's take a slow rude to living a good life
Don't say maybe
We'll take our time

[Chorus:]
Talking in the dark
Until we see the sunlight
Girl we have a spark
So let's go
Underneath the stars
Drinking up the moonlight
Taking our time
Living in slow motion, slow motion

I still thing about you and all our memories
Late night dancing to that Marvin Gaye
First time, back seat, Chevrolet
So can we live it, can we live it again
So pack your bags for a getaway
We take a trip back to our hideaway
Keep it old fashioned on the modern day
So can we live it [x4]
in slow motion

[Chorus:]
Talking in the dark
Until we see the sunlight
Girl we have a spark
So let's go
Underneath the stars
Drinking up the moonlight
Taking our time
Living in slow motion, slow motion
