HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
But I missed my bed
So I soon came home
They said:
"there's too much caffeine
In your blood stream
And a lack of real spice
In your life"
I said:
"leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Just surprised to still be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
No - just don't mention love!
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone
But you're still a yound man
So phone me, phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv
