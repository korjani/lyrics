I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usuallly its Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And: "May the lines sag heavy
And deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Becasue you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
Some people say
When usually its Nothing
Surly you're happy
It should be this way?
I said "No"
And then I shot myself
So, drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
XXXXXXXXX
