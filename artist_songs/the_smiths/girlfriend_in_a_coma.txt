Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
There were times
When I could
Have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know

There were times when I could
Have 'strangled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Let me whisper my last goodbyes

I know - IT'S SERIOUS
