[Chorus:]
Anything you want my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind

[Verse 1:]
You can have anything
You took my heart and plus a ring
I just wanna see you smile
I think about you all the time
One kiss'll blow my mind
Baby you're so damn fine
I don't mind
What your friends say about me girl
I don't mind
You can do anything you wanna do
I don't mind
My girl, my girl
You're so incredible
I don't care baby

[Chorus:]
Anything you want my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind

People wonder why I
Do the things that I
Things that I do for you They don't baby I really like the way
The way that you make me feel, that's why
I don't mind
If you're on the phone at night
I don't mind
Soon I'll be holding you real tight real tight
I don't mind
My girl, my girl
You're so incredible
I don't care baby

[Chorus:]
Anything you want my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind
