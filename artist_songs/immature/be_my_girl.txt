[Batman:]
You know best nothing I won't do for you
When you get down, just call me
I'll come around, and make it ok, yeah, ooh ooh

And there's just one thing you should know
That you will never be alone
If you need me, I'll be your friend
Just say you'll be my girl

[Chorus:]
Be my girl
Unlike anyone in the world
Say that you'll be mine
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Won't, you, be, my, girl

[Batman:]
Don't wanna put any pressure on you
Don't be frightened girl (Don't be frightened)
I'm a gentleman, until the end
This is true (Oh girl, it's true)

And if you look into my eyes
You will see you and me together
And if you put your hand in mine
Trust in me, in time will be
The one to give you love, yeah

[Chorus]

[Batman:]
I will be yours, until the end of time
You are the one that makes my sun shine (Shine)
Nothing I won't do for you
I'll be here, to see us through

[Chorus (Repeat 'til music fades)]
