Several days a month you made 
The mile to my house, 
And had me do a stroll with you. 

Far below a furry moon 
Our purposes crossed 
The weird divide 
Between our kinds 

The silver leaves of ailing trees 
Took flights as we passed so long ago 
But a short time i know. 

It pleases me this memory 
Has swollen up with age. 
Even time can do 
Good things to you.
