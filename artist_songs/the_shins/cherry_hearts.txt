You're not wanting anybody wants in you
I've got to understand
But I've been biting all my cherry hearts in two
You don't even care

Won't you ever come down from the big rock I found you climbing
Stowing your diamonds away

You kissed me once
When we were drunk
It left me spinning on my heels
Call the devil for the deal

You kissed me once
When we were drunk
My head went moving along the floor
Past the window, out the door

Once I said it I knew I wouldn't regret it too
It's just too much to share
Now you're thinking of sailing into the night
To the boy who wasn't there

I'm a practical guy
Sometimes I do fly off the handle
Thinking in scandalish ways, I've never done time
But I've done the crime of wanting
Something that never could stay

You kissed me once
When we were drunk
It left me spinning on my heels
Call the devil for the deal

You kissed me once
When we were drunk
And now I'm nervous when we meet
I got nothing under my feet

You kissed me once
While we were drunk
It left me spinning on my heels
Called the devil for the deal

You kissed me once
When we were drunk
My head went moving along the floor
Past the window, out the door
