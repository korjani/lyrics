One wound up punch of intuition 
Lays flat my whole take on us. 
You're the girl on the wing of a barnstormer 
The tidal rabbit who came of age before her time. 

We could have been so good-natured 
If i'd relented when you insisted, 
But we've been backed against 
All nature's walls far too long. 

You felt abandoned by me, 
I recall the sunshine as you were melting 
And though the comedy softens the fall 
They still hear us with their ears to the wall. 

I sold all my evil motives, 
No icicles stuck in my hide. 
I'm through with riddles, i know we're little 
Just help me feel warm inside. 

Before we take this ride and let it slide 
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide. 
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love. 
Remember you're the one who summoned me above any other kind. 

We could have been so good-natured 
If you'd relented when i insisted, 
We take a week off, let the garden grow by itself 
And let the gluttons fill themselves with all the worst of the gory ninties. 
And though the comedy softens the fall, we stall fall short. 

Before we take this ride and let it slide 
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide. 
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love. 
Remember you're the one who summoned me above any other kind.
