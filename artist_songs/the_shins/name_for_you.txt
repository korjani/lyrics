My girl if you're lucky one day
Rolling down the ancient high street you'll find
In the mirror reflects a woman in her prime
Can you make your way out?
In a world dearly won
Well it's yours love
You can move it around
Given all the drops in the ocean
Better take it one sip at a time
Somebody with an antique notion
Come along to tighten the line
They're just afraid of you speaking your mind

They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They got a name for everything
All of the clothes that you wear
And all of your bits and pieces yeah

You're flipping through the check-stand rags it appears
There ain't no time to waste, you're getting on in years
You can keep your can up
If you just never eat again
It's a means to a terrible end
Even if your plan is successful
Have you really got room in your life?
Yeah and it's a bland kind of torture
You've played the mother and wife
But what do you really dream of at night?

They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They got a name for everything
All of the clothes that you wear
And all of your bits and pieces yeah

They've got a name for you girls
Some stupid name
They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
What's in a name?
What's in a name?
What's in a name?
What's in a name?
