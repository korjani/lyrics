Slim lined sheik faced
Angel of the light 
Riding like a cowboy
In the graveyard of the night
New York Witch
In the dungeon of the day 
I'm trying to write my novel
But all you do is play 

Baby Boomerang, Baby Boomerang 
Well, you never spite a person 
But you always bang the whole gang 
Oh yeah...

Mince pie dog-eye 
Eagle on the wind 
I'm searching through this garbage 
Just looking for a friend 
Your uncle with an alligator 
Chained to his leg 
Dangles you your freedom 
Then he offers you his bed

It seems to me to dream 
Is something too wild 
In Max's Kansas City 
You're belladonna child 
Riding on the highways 
On the gateways to the south 
You're talking with your boots 
And you're walking with your mouth 

Baby Boomerang, Baby Boomerang 
Well, you never spite a person 
But you always bang the whole gang
