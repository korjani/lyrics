Let me lay it on the line 
I got a little freakiness inside 
And you know that the man 
Has got to deal with it 
I don't care what they say 
I'm not about to pay nobody's way 
'Cause it's all about the dog in me 
Mm-hmm 

[Chorus (1)]
I want to freak in the morning 
A freak in the evening just like me 
I need a roughneck brother 
That can satisfy me just for me 
If you are that kind of man 
'cuz i'm that kind of girl 
I got a freaky secret,everybody sing 
'cause we don't give a damn about a thing 

[Chorus (2)]
cause I will be a freak 
until the day until the dawn 
and we can pump, pump 
all through the night till the early morn 
come on and I will take you 
around the 'hood on a gangsta lean 
'cause we can pump, pump 
any time of day it's all good for me 

Boy, you're moving kind of slow 
You got to keep it up 
Now there you go 
There's just one thing that a man must do 
Mm-hmm 

I'm packing all the flavor you need 
I got you shook up on your knees 
'cause it's all about the dog in me 

[Chorus (1)]
I want to freak in the morning 
A freak in the evening just like me 
I need a roughneck brother 
That can satisfy me just for me 
If you are that kind of man 
'cuz i'm that kind of girl 
I got a freaky secret,everybody sing 
'cause we don't give a damn about a thing 

[Chorus (2)]
cause I will be a freak 
until the day until the dawn 
and we can pump, pump 
all through the night till the early morn 
come on and I will take you 
around the 'hood on a gangsta lean 
'cause we can pump, pump 
any time of day it's all good for me 

One to the two, to the two, to the three 
Adina, do you want to get freaky with me?..

[Chorus (1)]
I want to freak in the morning 
A freak in the evening just like me 
I need a roughneck brother 
That can satisfy me just for me 
If you are that kind of man 
'cuz i'm that kind of girl 
I got a freaky secret,everybody sing 
'cause we don't give a damn about a thing 

[Chorus (2)]
cause I will be a freak 
until the day until the dawn 
and we can pump, pump 
all through the night till the early morn 
come on and I will take you 
around the 'hood on a gangsta lean 
'cause we can pump, pump 
any time of day it's all good for me 

One to the two, to the two, to the three 
Adina, do you want to get freaky with me?..
