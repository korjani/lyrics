Yea they gotta be checked
People always hittin up my phone talkin crazy
(yo who the fuck are you?)
Yea they gotta be checked
It always starts out fine
But then they cross the line
And I'm like
Yea they gotta be
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked
Yea they gotta be
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked
Yea they gotta be

I think you do too much talkin
All of your girlfriends text us
Like they live in Austin
Often
We just
Let these hoes slide thru
I don't mean to ruffle and feathers when I fly thru
But you should just take into account that
You might try and check me
But your check is gonna bounce
That's a sticky situation
I would hate to be you
I know that you love me
All that hatin is just see thru

I suggest you come correct
Male or female
You close minded
I'm just gettin rich off retail
Funny cuz these hoes poppin back up
Shootin at my dreams
I ain't even call for back up
Bout to be pushin somethin crazy
Money comin down the pipeline
Standing on your rooftops
Fuckin up your skyline
While you gettin checked
I'm just checkin out my flight time
Bout to make yo salary 5 times

Different girl every day
Swear I'm livin like a rockstar
Train movin fast
I forgot where my stops are
I could see myself stayin on
Lotta girls in Saudi
I'm the one that they waitin on
I've been on a hot streak
Everything premeditated
Bigger than my body
Yea my soul just levitated
I call it out when I see it
I don't mind the confrontation
But before we even start the conversation
