[Russ:]
Fuck, yeah, I guess I...
I guess I could stop, a lot of people would probably stop
But I love this too much, man
I got too much I'm trying to do

From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going
From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going

I don't know what day it is
I don't know what month it is
I can't love a girl because I'm way too much in love with this
Different states, different countries
Crossing different continents
Self-beliefs my diving board
I'm swimming in accomplishments
Haven't slept since '06
Main focus is stay focused
Santorini wine tasting plus I'm off Amalfi coasting
And took my mom with me because without her there'd be none of this
I think she'd agree, she probably needs a brand new bucket list
Eating off my dreams, I'm my personal chef
Seven women in one night, that's just my personal best
Sent 110 to the family, sent 15 to my homies so I don't feel bad about my chain on my Rollie though
Approach you with assumptions, I promise that you know nothing
My family legs got cut off from my bank account, keeps on jumping
So I, keep on going
This bigger than me, that's just the day one ambition in me
Real one, yeah

From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going
From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going

[Bas:]
Yeah, niggas saying all my bars high
They can't follow mine, tryna chase me like a jaw line
Shine like a gold mine so my bottom line grow four times in a week
Got a gold mind and it's go time, I got no time for the weak
This week been show time after show time, still finding my peak
Don't know what day it is, now, don't know what month it is
Trying to hold my girl down, I'm sure I love her more than this
"Now, Bassy why you always missing?"
"Bassy, baby on a mission"
So we gon' love cause haters rampant
Put that cancer on remission
Listen, followed my passion that led me to purpose
Took me so long just to find out my worth
I went from knee deep to beneath the surface, beneath the surface (beneath that)
Living above my lows, I'm living above my lows
The show sell out, but the boy won't
And God got us, these hoes don't
I dropped the hottest shit in '16 and they still sleeping
I'm just finna do that shit again, it's off of everybody head
You ain't gotta give me mine, nah nigga, pay me every fuckin' cent
I'ma let the squad handle all the rest and God gon' handle whatever left
And...

From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going
From the morning I wake up
I start packing all my stuff
Tell the homies, tell the family
I gotta keep on going

I keep on going, keep on going, keep on going, keep on going, keep on going
I keep on going, keep on going, keep on going, keep on going, keep on going
