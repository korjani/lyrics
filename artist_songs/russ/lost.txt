I get lost, lost, lost, lost in you
I get lost, lost, lost, lost, lost in you

Yeah, now tell me baby are you real
I know you feel, like I feel
Now tell me baby are you lost in you

I hope you recognize the difference baby girl, cause I sure do
When we floating on that cloud, I know you feel the fuckin' truth
Bodies drip, soaked in seduction, obviously sippin'
This ain't home but this is something real

I get lost, lost, lost, lost in you
I get lost, lost, lost, lost, lost in you

You say you knew it when you met me, you felt our souls unite
You say I got your heart, we're clinging to this roller coster ride
So lost in love, blinded from all the fear
Please don't go ghost, I make your worries disappear
You say each breath is for you
I'll never let you go
Your love is all I wanna know

I get lost, lost, lost, lost in you
I get lost, lost, lost, lost, lost in you
I get lost, lost, lost, lost in you
I get lost, lost, lost, lost, lost in you
