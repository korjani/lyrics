I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Shit heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
