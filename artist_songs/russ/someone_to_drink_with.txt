[Hook:]
I just need someone to drink with
Someone to talk to when I'm drinkin'
Someone to touch on when I'm drinkin', drinkin', drinkin'
I just need someone to drink with
Someone to talk to when I'm drinkin'
Someone to love on when I'm drinkin', drinkin', drinkin'

I just, need someone to vibe with
We don't gotta forget
We can just get drunk yeah, buzzin'
Right now, I ain't really poppin'
All I got is liquor, love and truth
Girl you got options
I, only got ten dollars to my name right now
But that's enough for you and me
Girl come through
I'ma try my best not to love you, cause

Couple girls that missed out, I might loop back around
Got a phone full of texts like, "oh you back in town"
If you were me, would you slide through for you?
If I've been acting so brand new to you

Atlanta girl with her priorities off
Every picture that she posts, her insecurities talk
That's why I lay low
Never puttin' pressure on the pussy
Squad full of gods and we mob like goodie
But I can't lie I'm lookin' for some scenery adjustments
Her body is a temple but her mind's in construction
Nothing that we can't work on
I ain't tryna lead her on, cause
