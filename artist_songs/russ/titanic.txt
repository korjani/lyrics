Yuh
I hope everyone's okay with this

[Hook:]
Mama I been working, tryna get this money
Tell Dad please don't worry, no one's going hungry
But I know this ship just keeps on sinking
Gotta just keep on swimming
Hold on, I', coming to the rescue, rescue
You know I'm coming with some vests too, vests too
Everyone's suffocating, I've had enough of waiting
I'm tryna save us all from drowning

My parents in shambles
Cause lack of financials
They been late on car notes
Every dollar borrowed
They been back and forth, yeah
Leaving is an option
Debt's at the door, yeah
And it keeps on knocking
IRS is watching
Mama tryna get safe
Dad is being prideful
I'm just tryna get paid
Could have a signed a deal, yeah, but it wasn't worth it
Am I being selfish for knowing what my worth is?

I been selling songs though
I been getting on though
Bout to go on tour soon
Hopefully tomorrow
I just talked to Cara
Hopefully we good soon
It's never a bad time
To deliver good news
I know I'ma keep my head above water
I know I'ma pull this boat to the harbor
