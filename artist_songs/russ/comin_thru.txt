Yeah, see the difference between me
And whoever fuck is tryna do this shit too
I don't need to speak for you to hear me

Yeah, the rewards of self belief have turned me into an addict
Girls cheating, being hoes has turned me into a savage
Before I knew I was a prodigy, I was still bringing havoc
And my musics full of movies, all my shit's cinematic
Sometimes I feel insane, sometimes my mind should be padded
I'm just fucking up my walls, but I still build a palace
Cause there's more gold in my mind than you can mine in the Earth
Imagination flying free, my potential's my worth
Searching, saying for the longest I'm gonna be rich any minute
Rich is just a state of mind, believe me, I'm in it
Vanilla range, peanut butter seats with the windows tinted
That's the car, I get my sister off these iTunes digits
That watch says its coming, that car says I did it
I'mma drop a classic debut called "I'm not finished"
And I'm not fishing, but the money's swimming closer
So these hoes are getting thirstier, tryna grab my super soaker

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now
Yeah, I do this for you now

Let me tell y'all something

Yeah, now when you have everything, you don't need anything
But when you have everything, they're down for anything
See there's a lot of people who just look at you as a come up
So they mistreat you, they see the ornaments
They wanna take yours to hang they own on they Christmas tree
I just believed you cause I was raised with love
You thought I was the lick, but you ain't slick
See people change with love, try to take advantage
Cause they view it as a weakness like I'mma do whatever I want
And he won't see shit coming, but I peep bitch running
Keep it moving with your basic ass
Y'all small town hoes are all the same, I gotta plane to catch
Might sign a motherfucking deal
Might buy some motherfucking wheels
But just know, if I offer you the lifeline it's motherfucking real
Unless you DIEMON, my family or my fans, heres the plan, fuck 'em

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now
Yeah, I do this for you now

I'mma just talk shit one more time

Yeah, money right around the corner
I'm just waiting for the pick up
You call that shit a sixteen? I call that shit a pick up
Listen to your songs, sounding like you give up
Rappers sounding weak, I guess it's time for us to lift up
This whole game, cause Drakes the only one who's fucking shit up
The rest of y'all, hiding in the shadows like a ninja
But fuck your stealth, Russ is making noise
Turning up on myself like what

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now
Yeah, I do this for you now

And I'm still fucking here like
