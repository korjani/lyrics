Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

You're probably out wildin' with your friends right now
That's fine girl me too
I been at the booty club four times this week
Damn I need you
Wonder what's your vibe, what you look
What you smell, what you taste, what you fuck like
I don't care about any wrongs in your past
I just care if you love right
I think I fell in love with you
We just haven't met yet
I would drop my hoes for you
We just haven't met yet

Couple tickets in the holster
I would fly you out right now just let me know
Who you are, what you want, when you want it
Why you want it, how you want this to go

Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

My momma set the bar so high
I won't lie though you coming real close
I like that you care about real life shit
Not eyebrows and clothes
I like that you gotta lotta bodies
You a freak but that's all in the past
I like that you gotta good brain good morals
Its not all in the ass
I'd get on one knee for you
We just haven't met yet
Were perfect for each other I swear
We just haven't met yet

Couple tickets in the holster
I would fly you out right now just let me know
Who you are, what you want, when you want it
Why you want it, how you want this to go

Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet
We just haven't met yet

Baby I'm amazed by you
We just haven't met yet
I get lost in a maze with you
We just haven't met yet
