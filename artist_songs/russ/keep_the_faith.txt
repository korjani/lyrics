(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
Keep the faith and you will see
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)

Young girl left all alone in a world where you need somebody
Old habits die so hard, bottle after bottle tryna find somebody
Doesn't know how to cope with the baby in her stomach
So she got that coke in her nose
And her baby daddy ain't about shitty ?
He open up her legs, she wish she would have known

Keep the faith and you will see
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
Keep the faith and you will see
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)

And she fucks with that gangsta hip-hop
Daddy wasn't there, so she was raised by hip-hop
Impressionable, and that liquor so confessional
Bitch is so quiet, but her weed full of decibels
Loud shit, she ain't goin' nother, she a down bitch
But her mind so crowded with partyin' and bullshit
Plus, she got a pistol, finger on the trigger
And she can't wait to pull it
Till her daughter found her one day, looked up
Mami, I wanna be like you one day
And all it takes is one day
To lose it

Keep the faith and you will see
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
Keep the faith and you will see
(Don't lose it, don't lose it now)
