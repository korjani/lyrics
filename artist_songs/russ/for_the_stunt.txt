It took me 10 years to talk like this...

Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might go and blow like fifty
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt

I was broke a year ago I worked for this
Dropped 11 albums they all flopped but I learned from it
I don't go to church
But still I hope I reach the masses
Even though what took you years to make
I pay in monthly taxes
They use to say I brag too much
They use to say I sing too much
They use to say I rap too much
Now it's 10k just to drink too much
Now I got 10's in a hotel suite
When I show up it's the first time we meet
Now the highlight of your week
Is an Instagram video in the club
With a bunch of broke people peep

Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might go and blow like fifty
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt

Too busy eating my own fruit to check if yours is sweeter
Too busy watering my grass to check if yours is greener
I need a celebration
Celebrating hella patience
I was down but now I'm up
I'm celebrating elevation
Up
Ex's hate but I know it's love
Everyone late on the train but us
Still in a Nissan
Still with my day ones
Still keep it real as fuck
Plus
I boss up yeah it's been like that
Went on tour then I went right back
Millionaire new default setting
I keep on betting on me

Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might go and blow like fifty
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
