Baby you got confidence

Trapstar University
Gotta' minor in confidence
Major in finessing
The block gave her a scholarship
Graduated in jail
Her record is her diploma
Only job offers is flippin' pussy or marijuana
Or both
But she don't wanna' do either
She just want respect
She just wanna be Aretha
But she don't know how to get Franklins the legal way
She doesn't believe that she can
And that's when I say

Baby you got confidence
I love the way you talk that shit
Baby you got confidence
I love the way you talk that shit

She picked up the violin
She plays for money on the street now
But she still flippin' keys 'bout every other week now
Inbetween she still at the hotel posted
Cause she a fiend for the money
She gets her fix but feels broken
Cause she knows she's livin' dirty
Knows she gotta clean her life up
Knew she needed grooming
That's the reason why I wifed her
But I had to leave
She got pregnant
Wasn't mine though
Hopefully she hears from time to time though

Baby you got confidence
I love the way you talk that shit
Baby you got confidence
I love the way you talk that shit

You that bitch and you know that shit yeah, you know that shit
