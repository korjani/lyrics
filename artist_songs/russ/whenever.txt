Yeah
Aye uh...
Everybody means somethin' to someone
So yeah

Running the city wild
I think you're in denial
You drinking just by yourself
You thinking just 'bout yourself

Okay I'm pouring out a bottle for two of my ex's
Like Dos Equis
I tell the girl I'm talking to right now
Don't tempt me
Cause you're really looking like my next breakup song
She don't sleep on me, I'm the one she stay up on
But why is every first date like an interview
Why I gotta' take you out just to prove I'm into you
Why I gotta' trust you just to find out if I can
Shit, why I gotta' fuck you just to find out if I can
Yo listen

Since forever ain't forever
Let's just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you
But at least we'll be together
Oh-oohh-oh
Oh-oohh-oh

Since forever ain't forever
Let's just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you
But at least we'll be together
Oh-oohh-oh
Oh-oohh-oh

Running the city wild
I think you're in denial

Yeah, I'd rather slap you with the truth
Than kiss you with a lie
You're so busy making a living
That you forget to make a life
You should come through
Let me plant diamonds in your head
She said "I'm tired of always sleeping diagonal in my bed
I'm tired of always leaving in an uber
I'm tired of losing lovers and loving all these losers"
I say "You bring it all on yourself
Then we smoke, then we drink
I tell her "Go think it over, but don't ever over think"

Since forever ain't forever
Let's just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you
But at least we'll be together
Oh-oohh-oh
Oh-oohh-oh

Since forever ain't forever
Let's just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you
But at least we'll be together
Oh-oohh-oh
Oh-oohh-oh

This ain't your fantasy
Come over here and money dance for free
Come dance with me
Get in your boss stance with me
