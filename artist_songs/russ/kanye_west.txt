Damn
Yeah
It's crazy
Imma' show y'all How To Rob
But foreal
What up Kanye?
Or should I scream?
You know I had to put you on here
And you know it had to be this beat

I don't give a fuck what these hoes don't like
I don't give a fuck what these dudes don't like
I don't give a fuck what you don't like
I can still be a celebrity overnight
I can drive cars that you wanna' ride
I can fuck bitches that you wanna wife
But fuck that shit, cause it's not real life
And neither is being a celebrity, overnight

Yeah, knocking on hip-hops door like Jehovah
Russ on a Kanye beat like Hova
And I'm taking ova'
Heart to the Uzi
Double dollar sign, shoot truth like a movie
Blah blah blah, blah blah
Y'all bark too much, bow wow wow wow
Now I don't feel you bite, y'all
Get hot and flop in the same damn night
It's cool being on MTV
But when you gonna' let me on BET
Got labels in NYC
Got dimes in LA like CP3
When I fly to LA
Get high in LA
Know a couple chicks when I'm in LA
Paparazzi won't stop, stop, stop
All the cameras go pop, pop, pop
I found me and got lost in a big dream
Lost you and tryna' find you on a big screen
Now it's label office
Money on the table, in the label office
But it's 'bout damn time
It's been ten albums, 'bout these hours
Man, it's been ten thousand
Paparazzi won't stop, stop, stop
All the cameras go pop, pop, pop

I don't give a fuck what these hoes don't like
I don't give a fuck what these dudes don't like
I don't give a fuck what you don't like
I can still be a celebrity overnight
I can drive cars that you wanna' ride
I can fuck bitches that you wanna wife
But fuck that shit, cause it's not real life
And neither is being a celebrity, overnight
