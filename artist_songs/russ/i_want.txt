I'mma play the game the way that I want
Make this change, but never change, that's what I want
I'm on this "I fuck with me pill", try one
It may not be your way, but this what I want


Yeah, I want more Grammys than birthdays
I wanna make a million dollars every Tuesday and Thursday
I wanna shake the world
Probably call my next album "Earthquake"
I wanna take trips whenever, wherever, now peep the wordplay
I wanna girl like Shakira, I wanna never be lied to
I want Asa Akira to be her bedroom idol
I wanna keep it a thousand, I want the same in return
I wanna never be swayed like, "Yo, whats up world?"
I wanna win monopoly, I wanna own the most land
I wanna beach front property, I want my mom on the sand
I want songs that you can't get away from there, everywhere
I wanna shit on all my exes, I wanna act like I never cared
I want cops to stop killing, I want evil exposed
I want them to see a human instead of shooting a ghost
I want karma to be quicker
I want fifty Latinas, fifty Saudi girls and some liquor
That's what I call a mixer, c'mon

[SQUiRE:]
I just wanna be honest with the world and my soul
I just wanna have peace with my girl in our home
I want my kids to know the truth
About this world before they're grown
I want these gems inside my music so the youth love their own
I want my visions to be vivid in reality
I want our influence to mean more than our salaries
Like fuck all this shallow shit
I want all my family on this yacht
I had to paddle with through puddles of that rain and pain
On our way to the top still struggling
It was all a stream, it was all a dream
We could make a wave like tidal
Now I want the world to stream my songs everyday
On your internet waves like tidal
I want these waves to guide you to the shore, I'm sure of it
Been a drought on truth and passion too, just know I'm pouring it
This is what your soul wants if you rich or if you poor as shit
I just wanna make some fire, then go make some more of it, yeah
