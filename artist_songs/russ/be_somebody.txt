[Hook:]
Maybe you can be somebody
Something outside of the party
You run around the streets like all day
You can't do that and complain
But maybe you can be somebody
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Lately I been feelin like
This what I been workin towards
If you ain't tryna be the boss
Then tell me what you workin for
Certain doors were closed but now they opening up
Celebratin with some shots
Maybe poke on a couple sluts
Russells up next and i got this
Crazy like Britney and her loves so toxic
Got a wall up im tryna infilitrate her conscious
Takin 12 shots like where the cops is
Come on

You ain't gotta sell yo sex baby
I know that you tryna get a check baby
But you got talents you should pursue
You pushed me out when i pushed you
You ain't gotta sell yo sex baby
I know that you tryna get a check baby
But you got talents you should pursue
You pushed me out when i pushed you

Maybe you can be somebody
Something outside of the party
You run around the streets like all day
You can't do that and complain
But maybe you can be somebody
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I only see you when I'm drunk and lonely, lonely
Don't take it to serious
You don't know me, know me

Ride around Atlanta got drugs in the back like a pharmacy
Thoughts clogged up like an artery
Out all night like you homeless
You a dog so you go where the bone is
And a house ain't a home
Unless that house is where the dope is
So you trappin tryna not lose focus
On what the end goal is
Hood presidents are compelling
Even if they all felons now you hopeless but

Maybe you can be somebody
Something outside of the party
You run around the streets like all day
You can't do that and complain
But maybe you can be somebody
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
