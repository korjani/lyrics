[Hook:]
I can feel the distance
Everything is good until it switches
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference
No no no no nooooo

I remember ridin
All around Gwinnett
We used your weed man
Cuz he had the connect
Straight to Mexico
So we smokin on that mota
I never ever ever been so high
Same job I was there temporary
You were there permanent
I was tryna be legendary
So I had to quit
I was still tryna love you
Way before I dropped a song
RUSS WHO?????????
Turnt up dabblin with new bodies
I was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
So she moved on
I can't blame her
Its definitely my fault shes a stranger

[Hook:]
I can feel the distance
Everything is good until it switches
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference
No no no no nooooo

I remember ridin
Now Im on a new girl
Looked like princess jasmine
She showed me a whole new world
Tongue ring and tattoos
All over her body
And moved like she use to dance at Follies
Gettin money trappin out the hotel
But I didn't know cuz you know these hoes dont tell
She was sellin her pussy for barely any money
The cops tried to tell me when they cuffed me
Turnt up dabblin with new bodies
She was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
But thats all she knew
So I can't blame her
But damn I fell in love with a stranger

[Hook:]
I can feel the distance
Everything is good until it switches
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference
No no no no nooooo
