[Hook:]
Always knew I had to put in work
Always knew that this was gonna work
Always knew that I'd bring home the bands
Always knew that I'd become the man
I always knew that second guessing was the opposite of truth
I bet my future on my faith
And let myself do what I do
Now my gambles looking like
They weren't gambles after all
I always knew I always knew
Yea I always knew

Shows overseas and they sold out
Made your girl bring the hoe out
Lotta people tryna get in contact
Lotta people tryna get a contract
Cuz they want my name on a X
I ain't gonna lie yea I think about my ex
I ain't gonna lie yea I think about the checks
I ain't gonna lie yea I think I got next
Always been the one my fam turned to
Skeptics Imma convert you
Give your girl something she can twerk to
I always knew what rap star perks do
Always knew they'd all start callin
Always knew I'd have a lotta options
Always knew the money was a sure thing
Always knew I'd make the whole world sing

And let myself do what I do
Now my gambles looking like
They weren't gambles after all
I always knew I always knew
Yea I always knew

Always knew I couldn't trust nobody
Always knew I had to trust myself
Always knew they'd try and call me cocky
Always knew they didn't love themselves

Back in Atlanta and I'm workin
Always knew it'd paid off to be observant
Always knew I'd end up in a car with curtains
Always knew I'd elevate to a new version
Of my self
2.0
These shots so strong feel the recoil
Who's loyal?
I don't need two hands
Same ones I came in with
Oo yea
