I was always right and you know now
You was always wrong and you know now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
I was tryna help you out
But I got no time to help you now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

I need b's that's why you see me getting a buzz
My ex comin' after me like Mexican does
If heavens above
Hell is below
Where am I livin'?
Table full of legends
I see
Where am I sittin'?
I'm out your life but I'm still in your search bar
Still humble still riding in my first car
Took me 10 years to get here I work hard
From a basement
Now I'm an all around the world star
Supported my dreams till my dreams supported me
I'm lookin' at views that you don't see till 43
I'm half they age but twice as paid, this the good life
A bad chick doesn't always mean a good night
Heavy bars with light hooks so it seems pop
Lately they only want my responses for the screenshots
Upgraded to a Rollie from a G-Shock
The Alchemist, Napoleon Hill mixed with Deepak

I was always right and you know now
You was always wrong and you know now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
I was tryna help you out
But I got no time to help you now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

Looking at the type of views a camera can't capture
The girls coming quick but the money coming faster
Red carpet treatment for yourself and whoever you with
Any girl you want the answers yes whoever you pick
Cause you poppin now
You're a come up
My homies look like security so think before you run up
I'm one of few who did it their way
Taking over airwaves
5 course meals and lay flats on my airplanes
Your dream girl sending I miss you texts
I fly her out cause I miss that I miss you sex
Then I fly her back home
She a Florida state Seminole
Cause I got bands lined up like a festival
All over the world and I brought my mom with me
Just to say thank you and make her happy I spend 50
Ex's best friends now I don't give a fuck
I don't gotta get revenge
My life does that enough

I was always right and you know now
You was always wrong and you know now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
I was tryna help you out
But I got no time to help you now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yea I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this
