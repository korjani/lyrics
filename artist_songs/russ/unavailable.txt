I think you're unavailable
Because I'm unavailable
Which makes us unavailable
Yea it makes us unavailable
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

I'm always traveling
She says I do her foul
I tell her girl you know the rules so why you stepping out of bounds
You got me hot
Go cool off
We ain't together
So move on
You been taking shots they don't get thru I'm Luigi buffon
You know my house is on the road
That mouth got you exposed
You should stay in school and study
You should catch your words you're throwed
Don't come home for me
No
Don't come home for me

I think you're unavailable
Because I'm unavailable
Which makes us unavailable
Yea it makes us unavailable
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

I've been hurt
I've been tossed aside
My door was open
Now I'm locked inside
My ex's always covered up
Like they were Saudi
From Lebanon to Maui
If you understood my life
You wouldn't overstep your boundary
Hold up woah
Please back up
I got issues with my trust
Dated prostitutes and riders
Guess I like my women rough
But I'm too gone for you
Too on for you
I just wrote this song for you

I think you're unavailable
Because I'm unavailable
Which makes us unavailable
Yea it makes us unavailable
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
