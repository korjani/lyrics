Yeah
For those who may not know
I got exactly what you need
Boss my tat like I'm Hugo
Bet I blow I bet I reach
Where I'm tryin' to go my flow my beats
Crush you ants I make stampedes
Fuck yo plans just plan to leave
I'm coming through cause I planted seeds my fantasies
I'm coming true, you, you and him
Get the fuck out the way I'm movin' in
Two L's, One J, stay cooler than December in Vancouver
Damn, I'm two nice and I'm three real
Four Latinas in high heels
Five double shots at Six AM, I'm droppin' bombs on your mind feels

[Chorus x2:]
I can't fade away
I can't fade away
This is too real, too real, too real

Don't try to stop me it won't work
Get my purp from Captain Kirk
Wash it down with a little bit of gin
Then fuck your girl till she turns smurf
Not her first, not my last
Throw me love I drop that pass
I don't have time for the X's and O's
So I "X" these hoes out
My cash is way more important
These beats are my endorsement
So I'm up all night tryin' to earn my stripes
I'm blazin' trails like I'm from Portland
I'm so scorching, yup, torching blunts
I got skills it's more than luck
So I won't be ignored I force my way in if your door is shut

([Chorus x2:]
I can't fade away
I can't fade away
This is too real, too real, too real

[Bridge x2:]
I don't, I don't see you
Unless you wanna put on, put on these shoes
Until then I'm just going, going, going, going

[Chorus x2:]
I can't fade away
I can't fade away
This is too real, too real, too real
