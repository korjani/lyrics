You should let me in
I got what you need
You're scared shit I'm scared too
Don't tell me to leave
You should let me in girl
Ohhhhh yea yeaa
Lemme in lemme in

You was always sellin your soul
Thinking it could buy you love
I would pick you up late late night
You never gave no fuck
You was takin bullets no vest
I was tryna take your heart
You ain't let yourself in
I was doomed from the start

In love with people she never met
Places she never been to
I was tryna connect
Over weed over molly over liquor
Anything that would let me in quicker
That's how you know it's really real and I felt it
Shoulda saw this coming back when I was doing Velvet
But you were far from smooth
Layin in the same bed still far from you

You should let me in
I got what you need
You're scared shit I'm scared too
Don't tell me to leave
You should let me in girl
Ohhhhh yea yeaa
Lemme in lemme in

You ain't never had no family
Mine was down to take you
In if you was with it
But you made me hate you
Always lying non stop
Always disrespectful
You was stuck on bullshit
I was stuck on potential

Hotels and cities are starting to blur together
This liquor and this weed are starting to work together
Got me thinkin I should try and revisit
Bitches that I really shouldn't try and revisit
Relive it
Nah I think I'll pass
I thought she was open
Then she dropped the catch
Over and over again
I told her and told her again

You should let me in
I got what you need
You're scared shit I'm scared too
Don't tell me to leave
You should let me in girl
Ohhhhh yea yeaa
Lemme in lemme in

You was always sellin your soul
Thinking it could buy you love
I would pick you up late late night
You never gave no fuck
You was takin bullets no vest
I was tryna take your heart
You ain't let yourself in
I was doomed from the start
