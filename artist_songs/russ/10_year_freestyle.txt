Yuh, I'm cool on your opinion of my strategy
Phone full of women all mad at me
Cause they ain't on my mind like they use to
Cause I ain't got the time that I use to
Money tight as usual, but it's cool, because it's coming
And I don't ever follow your strut
I don't ever follow money, I just follow my gut
Now they following Russ
Yeah your boys gettin bigger now
Y'all careers dying, start pouring out the liquor now
Been at this since 06
Before it started being cool, to drop albums with no hits
I'm out here coming for all of it
I want all the acknowledgment
I want all the accomplishments
I want cars that's astonishing
Plus the house that my mommas in
Should be big as a continent
I make good on my promises
50 bitches to party with
Man, the world is my audience
I'm just tryna' give my statement
Billboard from a basement
The type of focus where you wonder where the day went
But do it all again
How to be a millionaire
It's getting harder to call a friend
Too many hidden agendas
You 50/50 with your character
My life is on the line
There's gone always be a barrier
Between me and most
I never let 'em too close
With the girls it's no different
I can't be falling for hoes
That's why I keep to myself
I stay recording tryna' upgrade
My life to the nights full of lights, cash, and runways
I haven't had a Monday since 18
I knew in high school I could go pro like KG
Lately it's been looking like I made the right decision
Found my way outta' the dark, I gotta' flash light vision
If her ass right but the face left, then I'm dippin'
I need a chick three for three like Pippin
Hang my jersey up, It's worthy of the rafters
I know their game, I ain't worried 'bout these rappers
It's too predictable now, it's so political now
And I'm sorry if I sound a little cynical now
It's just that most my favorite rappers are invisible now
Everyday I make a song that's just habitual now

Ain't nobody gonna' do it like me
Ain't nobody gonna fill the void I see but me, so here I go

Twelve shots like the cops, now I'm wasted
It's in the blood of America to be racist
Land of the taken
Home of the cover it all up and don't say shit
Act like it ain't happen, cut, copy, paste it
It's on every channel doesn't matter if you change it
I'm off it though
It ain't where I've gone
It's where I've gotta go
I tell these local girls what they wanna' know
Never fuck 'em twice, cause I won't be there to catch em
Self belief and a passion this is the natural reaction
I be singing these ballads
Like a young Mike Bolton
Sprewell with the raps though
Like Russ might choke him
Keep a few eyes open
I'm everywhere, I'm omnipresent
Wired with the drive of a Bugatti engine
I've been running non stop since fourteen
Ain't no time to slow up, man I need more beats
Even though I got 500 siting in a playlist
I'm starting to realize that the money won't change shit
I'm starting to realize that y'alls basic ain't my basic
On the plane to the A making a list of all the shit matters
Y'all opinions didn't make it
'Bout to be a A list celebrity
Wife me up a singer
Hope she gotta' accent
Hope she drinks liquor
Board of advisors, I can count on four fingers
Leave the middle one open
To let you know I ain't sweet
I've been a shepherd my whole life
I can't relate to the sheep
It's a shame you asleep
But I'm about to make your bed shake
Bow down to me I'm the Sensei
Let's play who's gon be here in a decade
Lotta yall are barely even making it to the next day

Man
The fuck?
The fuck are y'all doing man?
You out here getting ply phones and shit
Turning up talking 'bout dumb shit
Man
And the crazy shit is that, like, people believe you because you're poppin'
So you can say whatever you want
But that shit sound dumb as fuck
And all y'all got low fucking IQs
And all y'all figure out what's poppin' off in the water, like twenty-eight
Cause y'all lack guidance and that's not
Man, me, Bugus, and DIEMON 'bout to come through fuck all y'all up
Cause y'all mutha' fukka's are dumb as shit
It's just that simple
We're smart as fuck with good music
Fuck off
