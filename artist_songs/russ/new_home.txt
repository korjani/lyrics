Look around your circle, is there some love in these people?
Do you pass around inspiration or just a blunt with these people?
Do you pour up each other’s dreams or just get drunk with these people?
Shit, when you gonna learn you’re fucking up with these people?

You should look around
See what’s going down
It’s probably time to find a new home
Same sad song, lasted too long
I think it’s time to find a new home

If I called you a bitch
If I bruised you all up
If I treat you like shit
Would you give it all up?
Would you come fuck with me?
Would you cut off the fat?
AKA, the lifesuckers that are all on your back
You get in my car
I see your black eye
Imma' go far
But I still ask why, you
Fucking with dudes
That don’t fuck with you
I mean, they tell you that they love you, but they just love what you do
I’m talking ass clapping
While they hit it from the front
They just backstabbing
And yo ass laughing
Tryna' brush it off, like
It’s cool whatever man
I tell her, he’s raining on your sunshine
I’m the motherfucking weatherman

She just saying
Rain on me
I don’t feel shit
Put the pain on me
Weight on me
Come and show me love
Just don’t hate on me
But I tell her...

Okay, I’m acting off empathy
Yeah, chica you tempting me
Yeah, we into our lives, doing 85, with this Hennessy on my lap
I’m picking you up from your exes
He’s mean mugging blowing O’s
I’m still tryna' get next, shit
No I’m not, that’s my mind
Hold up, let me get this straight
Hold up, let me get it right
Hold up, let me just wait, damn

She just saying
Rain on me
I don’t feel shit
Put the pain on me
Weight on me
