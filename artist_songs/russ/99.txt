[TOTEM:]
They try and look me in the eyes and tell me
There ain't no prize to be won, no, no
No, I've been fighting for the top, I'm ready
All I know is I want it all, all

[Russ:]
Yeah, it's time to pack
Luggage full of dreams with the tags still intact
But the plastic's still wrapped, I haven't opened it
With my feet up on a top floor screaming "Jesus"
But I want more, it's all good, though
This feel like [?] blow a pound with my dawgs on my [?]
They love me in the hood, so
Shout out shout out to college spreading CD's round the discount mall like a virus
Bosses choking, hope your employees know how to do the heimlich
Left the bullshit way behind like Kirk Hinrich
I'm the first of my kind, ain't no doubt about it
Slightly schizophrenic, I'm in the studio with myself
There's still a crowd around
Think I finally found the youth, it's in the truth
Since 50 rocked the vest, I had the jukes
With my feet up on a top floor screaming "Jesus"
But I want more

[Hook - Russ:]
I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out
Who you are is what you do, not what you say
I bring the bang out, bang out
Ooh, I'm popping, ooh, I'm popping
Ooh, I'm popping, ooh, I'm popping

[Paulina:]
I made a promise to myself in '99
Not to shoot for the sky would've been my biggest crime
Sifted through my teens, growing now, I got a dream going
People said you sick for believing so I sneezed on 'em
Spent the rest nights focused on the lights
Aim for the stars, cock back, open flight
Then I got caught, hot fingerprints on the shotgun
List of success suspects and I'm the top one
You could see me [?], getting [?]
You could call my momma, if you ask, she'd admit that
Climbing from the bottom, got grit [?]
But the shooter in the pit cause she fit
So please don't pity me, you see me holding keys
I always like to tease, won't be the bitch to appease
Soon the hoes come running and the checks start coming
But I'm in it for the height, not the summit

[Hook - Russ:]
I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out
Who you are is what you do, not what you say
I bring the bang out, bang out
Ooh, I'm popping, ooh, I'm popping
Ooh, I'm popping, ooh, I'm popping

[Paulina:]
I made a promise to myself in '99
I was gonna shine
I made a promise to myself in '99
I was gonna shine
I made a promise to myself in '99
I was gonna shine
I made a promise to myself in '99
I was gonna shine
I made a promise to myself in '99
That I'd get real big, open up a few minds
I made a promise to myself in '99
I was gonna shine
