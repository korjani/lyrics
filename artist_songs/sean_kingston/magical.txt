It's magical, the way you make me feel inside
Can't let you go, no matter all I try you stay on my mind
I can hold your hands and you can hold mine

Now we can rock until the morning light
If I could I would change back the hands of time
That we can do everything so right

I'm just a thought away for you, babe
I know we had our ups and downs
But we say it gets crazy
But trust me girl, you can always count on me

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical, girl

Here we go on a roller coaster to paradise
So let me know what it's gonna take for me to free your mind
Tell 'em who's your man, 3 karats on your hand

Introduce you to a brand new life
They don't understand how we can make it last
We don't care 'cause everything's fine

I'm just a thought away for you, babe
I know we had our ups and downs but we say
It gets crazy
But trust me girl, you can always count on me

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical girl

Say we don't care how you feel, feel
Our love is magical for real, real
Say we don't care how you feel, oh no, oh no

Say we don't care how you feel, feel
Our love is magical for real, real
Say we don't care how you feel, oh no, oh no

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical, girl

Everybody say, now can we all say, hey, hey, hey, hey
