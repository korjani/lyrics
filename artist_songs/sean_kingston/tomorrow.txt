Visions in my head would lay
All the plans I had delayed
Tricks on me my mind will play
See you laying next to me

Wind that shakes the barley tree
Kurt, the only friend of me
He prepare me for that drinks
'Cause I will need all my strength

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait
(One more day)

I been countin' all the days
Watchin' all the season change
And I no longer have to wait
'Cause I'ma see your pretty face

I meet with this foolish shrink
Tries to tell me what to think
But I'm wiser than he know
In one ear and out it go

How can they say you don't exist?
When I've been branded by your lips
Nothing they can say or do
Will keep me from seeing you

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait
(One more day)

I been countin' all the days
(Hey)
Watchin' all the season change
(Hey)

And I no longer have to wait
(Hey)
'Cause I'ma see your pretty face
(Hey)

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
(One more day)

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait
(One more day)
