Young moola baby
JR
I’m at warrrrrrrrr

[Chorus]
I'm at war
Fighting for the one that I love
And the one that I truly need
I’m at war
Shawty I’d take a bullet for you girl
Cuz you mean the world to me
I’m at war

[Verse 1 - Sean Kingston]
Me love you girl
You lovin me
So don’t fight
Together it was meant to be
Me feel like
I’m in the army
Because to be with you
Thats where my heart wanna be
Its like I’m bout to die
Just to get with you
Feels like your putting me through world war 2
Got my soldier suit
And my timberland boots
Girl I’m down for whatever
Because my love is true

[Hook]
So I tell her
I’m at war with the love of my life
Sweat from my brows runnin down to my eyes
Everything you are is what I need in my life my life my life

[Chorus]
I’m at war
Fighting for the one that I love
And the one that I truly need

At war at war at war at war at war
I’m at war
At war at war at war at war at war

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Salute to all the veterans
Girl yo love is like a nuclear weapon
I’m a 5 star purple hearter purple sparker camouflager
Follow my every command and order
You can jus call me captain carter
So let the missiles rain on your parade
Cause my love is a soldier
And my heart is a grenade kabloom
I will find any platoon
Just call me world war 2

[Chorus]
I’m at war
Fighting for the one that I love
And the one that I truly need
I’m at war
Shawty id take a bullet for you girl
Because you mean the world to me

[Verse 3 - Sean Kingston]
Yo mother said
Don’t talk to me
But I went through err girl that I can see
So make me know
Whats your fantasies
Cause baby girl I think that extends to me
I’m on the frontline and I’m riskin’ my life
I’d make a sacrafice just to have you by my side
You’re the one I love
You’re the one I trust
I’ll hurt someone that comes between us

[Hook]
So I tell her
I’m at war with the love of my life
Sweat from my brows runnin’ down to my eyes
Everything you are is what I need in my life my life my life

[Chorus]

Fighting for the one that I love
And the one that I truly need
I’m at war
Shawty id take a bullet for you girl
Because you mean the world to me
I’m at war
At war at war at war at war at war
