He ain't fly, no, he don't even drive, no
That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone
He ain't even fly though ,you ain't gotta lie no
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it

[Hook]

My eyes are on this money and it's nothing he can do

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Ugh, you say you want a fly nigga
Roll somethin' and get high nigga
I spendin' all the most and if he ain't coming close then its time to tell him bye
I'll take you up in the sky
We'll be floatin'
Get you wet, like the ocean
I'ma speed up on it, if your pussy was a book I would read up on it
Girl I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post so I already know what it is
Talk to me now

[Bridge]
