[Sean Kingston] 
I'm losing my mind, 'cause she's one of a kind, 
Oh, she's so fine, gotta make her mine, 
Everything I do is only for you, 'cause you're my boo, 
Yes it's so true. 

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two, 
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through, 
Missing the days of being with you, 
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl. 
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose, 
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do, 
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl. 

[Joel Madden] 
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you, 
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do? 
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy, 
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby. 

Oh, Shoulda let you go [x3]
Let you go 

[Sean Kingston] 
Now I'm sitting home, feeling all alone, 
Wish you had a clone, 'cause girl you got me gone. 
Here in this chair, wishing you was here, 
But now it's getting clear, that you don't even care. 

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two, 
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through, 
Missing the days of being with you, 
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl. 
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose, 
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do, 
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl.

Oh, Shoulda let you go [x3]
Let you go 

But if I walked away, I know you'd come crawling back, 
You're playing hard to get, and I know it's all just an act. 

'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you, 
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?

Let you go 

Let you go go go go.
