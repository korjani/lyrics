Wrap you around
Wrap you around me
Wrap you around, eh, eh

Come over here and give me that
Some of that somethin' that you got, eh
Take my hand, take me heart
Take me anywhere you are

Oh, when I'm losin' my mind
And the madness just won't stop
I think about you, I think about me
I think about us together
I think of your eyes lookin' at mine
And I'm better, better

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh

Come, take me into that place
Only your love can take me, eh
Come, touch me now 'cause you're the one
With the touch that can save me, oh
When it all gets too much, when it all gets too crazy

I think about you, I think about me
I think about us together
I think of your kiss touching my lips
And I'm better, better

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh

Your love surrounds me on my tender shelter
I know no one could ever love me better
Nothing could make me feel the way I feel
When I'm beside you

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
