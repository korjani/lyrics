[Intro: Kingston]
This one's for the radio
This one's for the radio
This one's for the radio

[Hook: Kingston]
I need it in the summertime, oh
I need it in the wintertime, oh
I need it in the spring or fall
Get you wet in your drawers
Like I should, you've got that that seasonal love

[Verse 1: Kingston]
Met her at KOD - said she get off at 3
I'mma be right back - pick her up in my new V
Girl, you've got that good-good, I can't even lie
I ain't even trippig', girl, I know I am that guy
Girl don't hold back - pull up, throw these racks
Show money, no tax - young gun, just like that
Pour it, pour it up cause all I see is dollar signs
Givenchy embalm me, and my crib stay so fly

[Bridge: Kingston]
She say bands make her dance, money make her cum
Bring me a couple of bottles and 20,000 ones
She say bands make her dance, money make her cum
But girl, I ain't tripping cause you've got that seasonal love

[Hook: Kingston]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, couple feelings, she caught 'em
Summer feelings, not autumn
I'm cold baby, I'm a winter
Spring out of your garments
Rain down in your lower
Cause I'm up there like I'm polar
I could be the love of your life
Or I could fuck you like I don't know ya
All these chicks around don't really understand
Just say I could hold you down, don't really need no hand
Cause she move quick, elusive with no frontin'
Don't mean to beg or borrow, but I've got a little somethin'

[Bridge: Kingston]

[Hook: Kingston]

[Bridge 2: Kingston]
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
