Will I drive out in the night
Never come back in a mighty fright
Stay out longer while I can
Picking fossils in the sand

I admire all the games
Another asshole lights the flame
Rusted clotheslines in the sun
Noise control, I've sunken out

With smile the greatest written smile
No one to complain
Written in chrome and gore it's all the same

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

All I ever wanted was a piece to myself
All I ever wanted was a nine to five
People hide what they feel inside
So they'll cover it up til it's grey and dry

A pussy is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raised their arms to the leader outside
Praising the devil they said
Hell fuck yeah!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

I can't fight it I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devil run around inside
Will you take me under
I can't breathe if I cannot see
I can't see if I cant breathe

All I ever wanted was an afternoon
A middle class and an open sky
They rushed in the square with the paper alight
They pushed down a statue and spat on its side

A feeling is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raised their arms to a leader outside
Praising the devil the said
Hell fuck yeah

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

I can't fight it I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devil run around inside
Will you take me under
I can't breathe if I cannot see
I can't see if I can't breathe

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Fuck Yeah!
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down!
