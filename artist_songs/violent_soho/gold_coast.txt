When you're cracking
Like plastic
And you're drowning
So cable tied and worn

Cause its visions
On visions
Like hollow hungry wolves

Pay taxes
To a leader
So shaken to the bone

Cause its liars
Pushing liars
Throwing feeling out the door

Where did you go now
Where did you go
Right through the walls
Where did you go now
Where did you go
I'm on my own

When you're able
So civil
Screaming angels
Scratching at your door

Cause its layers
On layers
They'll drop on you like stones

Be quiet
And drive
I just want to hear the song

Feels mild
So awake
I'll put my toes back on

Cause its visions
On visions
Like hollow hungry wolves

Cause its liars
Pushing liars
Throwing feeling out the door

Where did you go now
Where did you go
Right through the walls
Where did you go now
Where did you go
I'm on my own

Where did you go now
Where did you go
Right through the walls
Where did you go now
Where did you go
I need to know

I'm not asking
I'm not asking
I'm not asking anymore

Where did you go now
Where did you go
Right through the walls
Where did you go now
Where did you go
I'm on my own

Where did you go now
Where did you go
Right through the walls
Where did you go now
Where did you go
I need to know

I'm not asking
