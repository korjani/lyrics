The heat it drawn itself on all the roads
With rattles from all the pubs and pokies rooms
The sound never goes
They'd given up the workers life
For a moment it was clear and so precise
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
I don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever
And we don't mind
And we don't care
We'll be here forever

Cause I burnt my life and I branded my soul
Went to church and sung to a god
And it breaks my heart
This is the place where it starts
Cause it's this suburban life and its grey paint world
Four wheel drives and its peaceful mould
I'll say it again
What ever happened to you my friend?
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever

It's the truth that keeps you warm
That lets you fall down
Like soda it will pop
Yeah let it fall down

Cause I'd rather play pokies and a dead friend's game
Stayed in a pub and drink warm beer
And I'll say thank you
For all the greetings and gratitude
Cause we don't complain enough but we never shut up
Talk to computers and made up drugs
And I'll say it again
What ever happened to you my friends?
And I'll say

I don't mind
I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind
We don't care
We'll be here forever

It's the truth that keeps you warm
And lets you fall down
Like soda it will pop
Yeah let it fall down
Let it fall down
Let it go
