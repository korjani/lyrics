Yeah
Well you can bump and grind
It is good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout let it all hang out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution, no no no

Well you can tear a plane in the falling rain
I drive a rolls royce 'cos it's good for my voice
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution, no no no - yeah!

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No way, yeah, wow!
