(Our Father, who art in Heaven)
(Hollowed be thy name)

I stand alone and watch the clock
I only wait for it to stop
And in the room locked up inside me (thy kingdom come)
The cutout magazines remind me
I sit and wait alone (thy will be done) in my room

And in my room against the wall
There is a picture very small (on Earth, as it is in Heaven)
A photograph I took some years ago
It shows a picture of the room I know
I sit and wait alone in my room (on Earth, as it is in Heaven)

[CHORUS]
The walls are white and in the night
The room is lit by electric light

(On Earth, as it is in Heaven)
I stand alone and watch the clock (and lead us not into temptation)
I only wait for it to stop
The doors are shut and all the windows lock
The only sound is from the clock
I sit and wait alone in my room (and deliver us from evil)

[CHORUS]

(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
(And deliver us from evil)
