Morning, this morning, the curtains are shut
I'll ring you in the morning, but the phone's been cut
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
The radio reporter said the line's all dead
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)

[CHORUS]
I'd wish they'd fix the wires, 'cause my baby don't know
That I'm leaving in the morning, and I'm ready to go
Can you hear me?  can you hear me at all?
Gotta get the operator, make a telephone call

And if I write a letter it won't get there on time
I'll only reach you, baby, on the telephone line
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
My car's all ready, and my bags are all packed
I'm late already, and I won't be back
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)
I've been calling you all day
Can you hear me? (oo, can you hear me? oo, can you hear me?)

[CHORUS]

Do do do do-do-do do do do
Do do do do-do-do do do do
Do do do do-do-do do do do
Do do do do-do-do do do do

(Can I help you?
(Hello?)
(You're playing with the phone, aren't you?)
(A person with no voice answering)
(I'm talking to the person who's got no voice  who's at the other end of this telephone)
(Getting his little kicks playing on the telephone)

[CHORUS]

(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
(Oo, can you hear me?)
