[Lil Mouse:]
Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full, so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest, so I guess you mad

Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full, so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest, so I guess you mad

Came up from the bottom so I guess you mad
Pull up in a drop-top 'Rari, they like "Who is that?"
VVS in my chain, I know why you mad
Everywhere I go they know me, ain't no "Who is that?"
Gettin' money on my mind, I'm so into that
If I spend some money I'm a get it back
Boy, I'm headed to the top and I ain't looking back
Can't wear no skinny pants, cause they can't fit my racks
I'm just running to the money like a running bag
Don't care nothing about it if it ain't a check
Lil flexin', I just spent a sack
I'm the number one young stunter, I know why you mad

Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full, so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest, so I guess you mad

Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full, so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest, so I guess you mad

[Lil Durk:]
Guess you mad nigga, don't get back nigga
Homicide, mama cryin', sad nigga
Car with jack niggas, copped the ecstasy
Don't sip green, just sip the best shit
.40 in his grill like a 2 pieced crash shit
Shorty eat too, at the dead just exit
Let's get wet shit, who pussy the wettest
I could fuck on my name and check shit
Your man sucks to it, you won't ask shit
Dope in the closet, choppers in attics
.40s and MAC shit, gone like magic
You ain't real, so I guess I got catfished
Bitch you guessed it, bitch you guessed it
I'm with it, I'm with it, I givin' no crip
I call on my hittas, let's get it, let's get it
L's, so mad so mad
My car fast, so fast
And I'm in here with my niggas
Ain't sayin' they name cause they killas
