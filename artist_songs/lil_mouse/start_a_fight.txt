Le-le-let's start a fight in the party
Le-let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Le-let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party

Let's start a fight in the party, I'm at the club with my partner
I'm at VIP and the waiter bringing them bottles
If you look in that mirror we start a fight in the party
Knock 'em down them stomp 'em out, got goons in this party
There's a lot of money on me, got these bands in this party
When I leave out the club I pull off in the 'Rari
Cameras flashing, boy, they realize I'm a star in this party
I'm a youngin so they asking how I got in the party
I be rolling through the city in the Porsche counting 50's
And that Range truck right behind me, windows tinted
Hit the club and I'm jumping out that car with no ceiling
If you mugging in the club we turn up in the building

Le-le-let's start a fight in the party
Le-let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Le-let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party
Let's start a fight in the party

[Paul Wall:]
Walked through the door strapped with the.44
Said I liked [?], got bud on the flo'
Where you from? Represent, let them boys know
How much my grill cost, why you wanna know?
Steal you in your mouth if you acting like a ho
Mean mug, I'm a face, put you in your place
Go ahead and tell me how the concrete taste
50 deep in the club like Tre
Hood in the air, representing where I stay
Blade in my hand, cut you open, filet
Staring at a grown man, ho, is you gay?
Got a whole lot of goons with me
Lot of lead, but no cartoons with me
Talk money, rapping this fluently
Caught a mill on the wrist, that's 250
Hold up, off the shoulders, I hook 'em up like T.Pain
One, two, 'bout to knock out your gold fangs
Quick jab to your jaw, shake your whole frame
Whole clique on the way, that's a damn shame
Search you up, clean you up, take your watch and chain
Watch out for them lames, stay in your lane
I am a fool with them hands, thinking it's a game
When the police come you gon' know no names
