I be wildin, I might slide dick in yo main hoe
Ride thru, stop the car, let them thangs blow
Where I'm from everyday another body drop
Nigga hanging out the window with a 50 shot
We don't rap beef nigga put him in a box
Niggas talking about they sliding, I bought a Glock
Lil nigga got a K that hold a hundred shots
Real niggas make the pussys run 100 blocks
Love Glocks more than rugers, cause they shoot better
Hella bands the money team, I feel like Mayweather
Every since I drop get smoked, They wanna be me
Everybody watching me like I'm a T.V
I ain't watching nobody, but the police
And these hoes cause these bitches to sneaky
In the foreign windows tinted, you can't see me
All black and that drum hold 50
Mister hella bands, I make this shit look easy
I'm smoking dope I'm with the stars, I'm getting tree, tree
Got yo lil bitch in my new whip, she giving nee, nee
Niggas saying he going to do me, when he see me
Don't make me have to play crazy
And come 3 deep, 30s and the glizzys
Leave a nigga six feet, run up on him
He got froze when he saw the heat
All these diamonds in my chain so you know I'm flee
Ain't no bitch in my blood, no exposing me
Too many niggas out here plotting so I keep the heat
Too many niggas out here telling so I'm low-key
Riding smoking with D Money we got 4 heat
And he'll shoot a motherfucker that try to poke me
Don't conversate with niggas homie you don't know me
All this money in my pockets got my pants low
Niggas mad, hating on me cause they bands low
All these chains on, bitch I feel like Jango
I'm in that new thang, same color Balmain coat
I be wildin, I might slide dick in yo main hoe
Ride thru, stop the car, let them thangs blow
Put a 30 in it just so it can hang low
Stop acting stupid nigga you know how this game go
