Hello boy it's been a while
Guess you'll be glad to know
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends
But I never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes
I still go crazy
No my heart just can't hide that old feeling inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby you know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy

You say she satisfies your mind
Tells you all of her dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No it just ain't true

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes
I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It's starts burning inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy

I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy
No my heart just can't hide
That old feeling inside
Way deep down inside
I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy

Crazy
