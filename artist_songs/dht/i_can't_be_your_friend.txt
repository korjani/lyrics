You can run to me
You can laugh at me
Or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be your friend anymore

This might come as quite a shock
But I've given it a lot of thought
This thing that's come between us can't be ignored
I've taken all I can
This is where it's got to end
Cause I can't be your friend anymore

And I can't be accused
Of not being there for you
How many nights have you shown up at my door?
I hope you understand
That this wasn't in my plans
But I can't be your friend anymore

And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
And all I wanna do is show how I really feel inside
You can run to me
You can laugh at me
Or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be your friend anymore

So baby now it's up to you
Do I win or do I lose
Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor
Well take me as I am
Cause I want you to be my man
But I can't be your friend anymore

And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
And all I wanna do is show you
How I really feel inside
You can run to me
You can laugh at me
Or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be your friend anymore

And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
And all I wanna do is show you
How I really feel inside
You can run to me
You can laugh at me
Or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be just friends anymore
