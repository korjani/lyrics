[Troy Ave:]
Money ain't the issue baby, you already know that
Just a young player, you can find me where the dough at
Streets keep calling sell my soul
Something bout the paper man, I just don't know
And it's on me yeah
Whatever you want I can buy right now
It's on me yeah
If nigga try front, he can die right now

[Young Lito:]
Young fly nigga, foreign car whipper
Chick hitter, the girl you love, I probably dissed her
Balling, I should be on ESPN
Instead I'm in the suite with a lesbian
I love the homies but me and money, best of friends
Got racks in any jeans that you catch me in
Plus I still got the grip on me, I don't slip homie
Take your life, leave your kids and your bitch lonely
On my job, putting it on for the squad
Used to be selling hard, now making hits like the mob
Whatever you want, baby girl it ain't a problem
You see a nigga living large, Lito

[Troy Ave:]
Money ain't the issue baby, you already know that
Just a young player, you can find me where the dough at
Streets keep calling sell my soul
Something bout the paper man, I just don't know
And it's on me yeah
Whatever you want I can buy right now
It's on me yeah
If nigga try front, he can die right now

[Young Lito:]
VIP full of Rose, I got the best hoes
I used to buy my chicks chains with the XOs
Now I'm pushing whips you see at the expos
Haters talk slick 'til they get exposed
I'm a young, lit nigga, call me killa yeah
Froze me with the gear, ice, no frigidaire there
Neck blinging, niggas scared, got bullets they could share
Get hoes by the pair, Young Lito nigga yeah

[Troy Ave:]

Something bout the paper man, I just don't know
And it's on me yeah
Whatever you want I can buy right now
It's on me yeah
If nigga try front, he can die right now

Out in Arizona all my Spanish bitch balling
Fucking with some other birds on my dirty phone
Multitask, I get multi-cash
Me and hoes, smoking blunts, burning mo' top gas
240 on my latest, I got multi-dash
Boys that I floss and they all so fast
Getting neck in 'em, I got bow tie swag
But its more than suitable to put you niggas in the grass

Money ain't the issue baby, you already know that
Just a young player, you can find me where the dough at
Streets keep calling sell my soul
Something bout the paper man, I just don't know
And it's on me yeah
Whatever you want I can buy right now
It's on me yeah
If nigga try front, he can die right now
