Look at the degrees, it say 90 but it feel like 100
I'm hot boy, to it, who you think they talk to
The bad bitches, the mad niggas, that's who my gun for
Blast stitching and blast thinner, they both down for
Five on the hippie, five in the whippy
Me and seven in the seven cities, would you bet me
And two friends yelling no new friends
Giving them D, breaking in dope, cool love end for the week shift
Barbeque on the block, too dope for beaches
My [?] features sun kiss, orange G shit, pull back top when the ill black jock
Oh, that's my homey J, yo, put away that Glock
My shooters be ready and deadly, I trained them well
My women be plenty and friendly, they kiss, don't tell
The fish gonna fry itself in the kitchen, we moving on up
Free all my niggas from they cells, boy on commission

Ball players, swag, inside out, bunch of fly bitches outside when it's hot out
90 degrees, only right I bring the drop out, slipping please
You know I'm here with the black out
Moving on white like Jesus, ice, no freezers
Niggas can't see us and the girls wanna freak us
Summertime trill, yeah, I'm coming out the speakers
Out there, find me on the block, getting mine up

I made it, classic moves and classic shoes
With a Cuban linked on, that's some classic jewels
My homie Yankee pulled the red Porsche on the boat up
And the girls want the call, yeah, we like, show, show
But we got all sorts, black, white, Asian and Spanish girls
At the la marina look amazing, the navy gazing, we blazing
Playing, spazzing, and johnny pump open, hold it down, don't spray her
Mammy with the polka, water gun, see her soaked up
But only we her hair if you paying to do it over
'Cause chicks get mad and trip like six flags
High rollers, no coasters, fill the cups, place cash on the floor
Dice games for twenty or more
No ass bet, just ice cheddar, it's the allure of the streets
Mixed in with the heat in this jungle of concrete I got soul for cheap, word

Ball players, swag, inside out, bunch of fly bitches outside when it's hot out
90 degrees, only right I bring the drop out, slipping please
You know I'm here with the black out
Moving on white like Jesus, ice, no freezers
Niggas can't see us and the girls wanna freak us
Summertime trill, yeah, I'm coming out the speakers
Out there, find me on the block, getting mine up

Summertime, summer grind, some will know, some will shine
I'm just getting money representing for the streets
Summertime, summer grind, some will know, some will shine
I'm just getting money representing for the streets
Summertime, summer grind, some will know, some will shine
I'm just getting money representing for the streets
