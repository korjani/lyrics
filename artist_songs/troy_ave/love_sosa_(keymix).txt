I been feeling so damn dope now lately
I wake up early with a girly, she ain't my lady
It's just another toy, give me pain, give me joy
It's the pyrex pot fisht, spot blaze boy, louder

[Hook:]
Bitches love soda, cooking like it's folders
In my grandma basement, she say boy what's that odor
I say I don't know ma, I love the aroma
This the smell of money when you lit it make it longer
These bitches love soda, mixed with the foca
Put the fire lower, burn it down slower
Spin it like a roller, keep some freezer water
And a honest smoker, they gonn let you know
But these bitches love soda

The names had me pow up, oh they call me...
A the... houses, snow like an aspic
Psb them dope boys, everybody know that
I am a dealer and a killer but don't quote that
We don't fuck with chuck niggas
We rather get bucks with it
A bunch of pretty hoes, lot of fly bitches fuck with us
Could be your girlfriend, or your baby mama
You just gotta deal with it, cause you don't want drama
I ain't taking losses, michael take some porsches
For a test driving, buy it if I like the horses
I can really do that, ask my nigga wu jack,
He just bought a new mac, and he fiending to shoot that

Man I be on that bullshit, what did you expect though
Born and raised in brooklyn, you niggas just slept close
Fronting gets you nowhere, so don't even go there
I hit you in your face quick, red dot, reindeer
Now you just a rudolph, headshots a rude off
I ain't got no manners, I demand you take your jewels off
Only robbing fuck boys just to violate them
Diamonds in my Jesus, God why you create them
If I ruled the world, it would be sucker free
And it would be a joy and I would have every key
Even in the drought still I had plenty keys
Asking niggas getting money, what's the truth about me, aha
