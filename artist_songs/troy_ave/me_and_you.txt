[Intro:]
In the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Everybody's gonna go to a grave
We might be similar, but we are different in many ways
Whether it be your reaction time, or your scale of pay

[Hook:]
You work a job, I got work that's hard, we both workin' hard
But you ain't me and I ain't you
You let shit slide, I'm down to ride
I got heart and pride
You ain't me and I ain't you
She savin' up, while she broke as fuck
Turned down for what
You ain't me and I ain't you
I came to fuck, you came to cuff
That's lame as fuck
You ain't me and I ain't you

[Verse 1:]
I pat myself on the shoulder, fuck a bitch and roll her over
She from Cali, so she say I'm the bomb and shit
I been myself in the world is constantly tryin' to make me someone else
That's a great accomplishment
I'm a leader, I don't follow dick eaters, go ahead and swallow
I brought Coogi back on the street, the first is Big
My heaters, filled with hollows
My closet, like the Apollo
Show time, furs galore, they bitin' the kid
Swagger jackin' at an all time high
This is true, I ain't on yet, but they on mine
Damn you too?
I got a fade with a part dope boy swag, fucker
The world gonna know when they see me on that freshman cover
Maybe, never know
It's like even the odds, last year's the only time that I ever got robbed
And I'm talking bout magazines, not men with the masks, you see, who?
You ain't me, I'm not a victim like you

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I think I'm in loooooove, ew
In between the legs of a chick so thick it feel like a tub
Gettin' my back rubbed, a lil better than Posh
That's still my lil bitch, but she lookin' for something I'm not
I am that nigga, New York's rekindled
We back, hot
If you was rappin' like a southerner, don't think I forgot
You my sons, you ain't my man
I'm big homie, in this here land
I told niggas I was gonna do it, y'all told lies to the fans
Troy Ave would never do ya like that, baby
Shit is wack, I'm only dealin' in facts, play me
With confidence, this the brand you can trust and believe
Vacant cribs to vacations, I lived A through Z
They reality grips ain't firm, they don't know AZ
I'm on Summer Jam with Nas, I think I fingerpopped Foxy
And she was poppin' in command of that year brand new
I didn't fuck though just keeping it true haha

[Hook]
