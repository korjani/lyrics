[Hook x2 - Ty Dolla $ign:] 
I ain't into playin' games and fuckin' up your world, baby
I ain't 'bout to tell you that I'm lookin' for a girl, baby
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
Cause if you knew better, you'd do better

[Verse 1 - Troy Ave:]
Shouts to all the real bitches, cause I know you [?]
You ever find out a nigga fake, but it’s too late?
[?] freckles and some daisies, her head game was crazy
Fuck around till she got pregnant with a baby
Baby daddy a sucker, who scamming and flossing
Broke the condom knowing she ain’t down with abortion
Her mama said keep it, that’s against our religion
And if your father was alive you know he would be with it
So she birthed the boy, named him after her daddy
Used to have a little bubble, now a full blown fatty
So she [?], a nigga too controlling
She grabbed her old phone, plugged it in and got to scrolling
You know them Ts way down
Emoji with the smiley face, look who I found
I’m like ay yo, who this? [?] date one bitch
My baby daddy a dick and you the one that I miss
For real

[Hook x2 - Ty Dolla $ign:] 
I ain't into playin' games and fuckin' up your world, baby
I ain't 'bout to tell you that I'm lookin' for a girl, baby
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
Cause if you knew better, you'd do better

[Verse 2 – Troy Ave:]
My little ran away girl, had her since 19
I wasn’t rapping, I was selling coke and crack on the scene
Dope boy Troy slash Benzo Rowan
A pretty great fund with this pretty thing going
Whatever I want, she do whatever I want
She only know to say yes, she know better to front
My other bitch was annoying, she don’t give me no [?]
Smoking blunts in the sport down to Baltimore Harbor
Put a pair of wings on it, nigga she knew
People stressing, goons pressing, she ain’t give up her boo
She said them niggas pussy, you should give them some too
I’m like girl I’m just tryna give this dick to you
And my love to you, plus my loyalty too
I had girl, she had a baby daddy, both them through
We still strong, for all this long
So to you I had to dedicate this song

[Hook x2 - Ty Dolla $ign:] 
I ain't into playin' games and fuckin' up your world, baby
I ain't 'bout to tell you that I'm lookin' for a girl, baby
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
You should fuck wit' me, you should fuck wit' me
Cause if you knew better, you'd do better
