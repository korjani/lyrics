[Intro:]
Tryina stay about the light, about the spotlight, the club
I don't like how I stunt man, I'm tryin to hive
I'm tryin to be new but it's all fake
Understand what I'm sayin?
This life, this game
Ya ain't no lovin it, it don't love you back

[Verse 1:]
This party don't stop til the drugs are gone 
We finally come down then the love's all gone
The love's all gone
It's never what it was at all
But fuck that tho
I want some mo'
'Cause damn it feel good
I'm doin me
Let me feel good
But do you believe?
Make me believe it
I get high as I want to
I fly if I want to
If I decide then I want to
I decided I want to
And it keep, it keeps calling me

[Hook:]
I'm addicted to the love, I don't know if it's really (love what I'm feelin)
I'm addicted to the love, I don't know if you hear me (love what I'm feelin)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
The love, the love
Powder.

[Verse 2:]
The most dangerous drug known to man, aha
But it don't come in grams
It come in the form of mamas, missus, bitches, even hoes, damn
Shorty got a nice face, her girl got a nice body
Broke poppin off molly, this my type of party
I'm addicted to the money, the fame and the bullshit
Strapped up shorty quick the flame out a full clip
Ain't seen, it's like my life is a movie
I'm in Brooklyn to Tulia and Megan in the Jacuzzi
If your girl only knew that she was playing with my dick under the club was too
It would be a fight with two blondes, makin her fight in my blowns
That pussy tight til she fall asleep at night
It prolongues when it's bright
Get acquainted, that bitch just played me
But this art thou real life, crazy ain't it?

[Hook:]
I'm addicted to the love, I don't know if it's really (love what I'm feelin)
I'm addicted to the love, I don't know if you hear me (love what I'm feelin)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
I'm addicted to the love (I'm addicted to the love)
The love, the love
