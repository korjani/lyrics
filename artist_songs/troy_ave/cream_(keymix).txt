[Verse:]
Got my swag shooter on, I need a brand new case
Man I'm fly as fuck the flavor went King K
Paints on the road, fly as shit when we broke
Seasons four, winter, spring, summer, autumn,
HP, BSB, HE, LL, O baby yes me,
Hoes feelin, smooth skinning, drug dealer,
Mad niggas be out on the yolk my buzz iller,
I'm a ill nigga, dog rise by ill figure as a little nigga
Count G's now I'm a biggie in the dope game,
Than these fellow niggas with rap names,
I'm named after my block, Troy Ave lane
Chitty-chitty, bang bang, still in this street thing
We'll be at the bar, play Nets versus Heat game
Powder, what these other niggas sees man,
See same cheat man, these other niggas weak mane
Talking bout their proud of me,
Pay attention at my moves but I style for free,
Many bum niggas styling ain't no styling me,
Big riding never been transportation be,

[Outro:]
That's all you get for free
Powder!
Aha!

East coast shit,
Mothe fucker,
Get high motherfucker
We getting loud motherfucker
Aha motherfucker!
Is you ready to die motherfucker?
