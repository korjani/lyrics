[Verse 1:]
Layin in it baby, with the bitch
I just wanna shit
I wake up, I get sucked, Colorado shine
Get to the money on my phone, see him by to move
Out the 6 5 was going, half the bird blew the coupe
Wings on my feet, wear these shoes when I'm making plays
Break back straight up cash, money when I'm makin good
We been thinking bout dipping in, the poovs on some coova shit
I'm just out here doing doughnuts, wailing out on some food

[Hook:]
I got a bad bitch, red lipstick,
Lookin some pearl
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
Rolling up a blunt
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm just cookin up
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
She just wanna fuck
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
Right here on her knees
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm here smoking weed
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm a fuckin cheat
Bad bitch, red lips
Bad bitch, red lips

[Verse 2:]
Rad bitch, red lipstick, pealing through the green
Black Panamera, yellow brake pads whippin me
When I hit the scene yea I flood the screen look at me
Cold up in the streets, you know that heat
I let it cook for me
Lawyers on retainers so the judge don't throw the book at me
10 stacks or better if you talkin about booking me
Rad chick, red bottom heels, Christian Loubreteen
Loubrettons, when I'm bout to fuck she gotta pull on

[Hook:]
I got a bad bitch, red lipstick,
Lookin some pearl
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
Rolling up a blunt
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm just cookin up
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
She just wanna fuck
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
Right here on her knees
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm here smoking weed
Bad bitch, red lipstick,
I'm a fuckin cheat
Bad bitch, red lips
Bad bitch, red lips
