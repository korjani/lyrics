Two semi autos, we bout to go for it
Took off so fast, I'm yellin' go Forrest
Nigga run fast with yo punk ass
When my gun blast somethin' gon' pass
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Fuck you and who say you'll be missed
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Seventeen, bet you all we won't miss

Crusader's one of the realest verses I eva wrote
But all my verses be real, you could believe the quotes
I'm movin' real how I feel, I turn niggas to ghosts
These rumors have it, don't kill me, don't get up your hopes
I stay ready and my wrist steady
Niggas that I'm with daily, come and get buried
John Flint, still I never slit
Matchin' shorts with the grisp, movin' militant, yessir
80 thousand worth of jewels on me, burr
Niggas trying to be my new homies, curve
Trust will get you dust or lined up by a herd, damn bitch
Over bread he go to paper, sandwich
Corner stores full of murals, a past vic
Don't's, was the king, getting slicker was ages, Don't
Play my mirrors don't play that shit when I, Come
Nigga I'm not dumb, no
My paranoia's healthy
They wanna be gangsta I just wanna be black and wealthy, God

Two semi autos, we bout to go for it
Took off so fast, I'm yellin' go Forrest
Nigga run fast with yo punk ass
When my gun blast somethin' gon' pass
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Fuck you and who say you'll be missed
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Seventeen, bet you all we won't miss

I stay strapped everyday, pussy
I kill you like I'm bout to kill J, pussy
She a hot count lil honey
I don't count on nobody I just count on my money
These niggas broke and full of excuses - ridiculous
Me and the paper in sync like dirty dishes
My nigga Block clean diamonds in his dentures
Eatin' on rock slings, grind is relentless
And the same goes for me
Champs say it's always shovel when I'm wearing that gold T
That's my muthafuckin' brother, he'll kill anything fo' me
Real nigga shit, I don't owe nothin' when I pull up out that dealership
You betta know who you dealin' with

Two semi autos, we bout to go for it
Took off so fast, I'm yellin' go Forrest
Nigga run fast with yo punk ass
When my gun blast somethin' gon' pass
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Fuck you and who say you'll be missed
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Seventeen, bet you all we won't miss

I praise God and I get money, in that order
I'm a million dollar nigga drinking tab water
I don't care about the crowds or impressing no grown man
I only got one son, and y'all are not him
Shouts to little Rell Rell, daddy got the good lo'
Shining on these niggas I done climbed up from below
Thousand dollar fixtures just to light up my new flow
Statuary marble fill the veins like it do dope
That's a nine, she a nine
Baby bag cost a dime, hold my nine
But a real bitch's no denying
She say fine, I swear it better stay in line
Or else I'm firing, Powder

Two semi autos, we bout to go for it
Took off so fast, I'm yellin' go Forrest
Nigga run fast with yo punk ass
When my gun blast somethin' gon' pass
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Fuck you and who say you'll be missed
Pussy nigga, talk that talk
You gon' get all that chalk
Seventeen, bet you all we won't miss
