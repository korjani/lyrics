BSB the crew, I'm fucking your boo
I pick her and and dick her down and drop her off with you
You tell her if she with me you gonna murder death and kill her

Bitch niggas in their emotions
When you calling her phone and she don't pick up you get in your emotions
Bitch niggas in their emotions
When you ask where she was, she don't tell you you get in your emotions

[Troy Ave:]
I was fucking this chick, who did my graphic design
Her baby daddy in jail, he left a nut and [?]
I put her on with this nigga, her pussy right in her pocket
He was a nice little rapper, but all his artwork was garbage
He fell in love with the bitch but little did I know
I called her to suck my dick, he called me back like, "Yo bro"
I picked up and lost interest, cause he was talking about music
Later she said when you hit me, yo he just started to lose it

[Young Lito:]
See I don't understand why all you niggas be mad
See your bitch you can have, that's just a chick that I had
Right after I get my nut I put the ho in a cab
Too busy watching the kids, and you ain't even their dad
You sad but you deserve it, I know your heart hurted
When you heard she was with me, and then you called and she curved it
Now you tweeting me threats, boy don't get yourself murdered
Between me and you, the bitch cool but she ain't worth it
Plus you know how I give it up, so why would you push me
Ain't ride for your mans but you ready to die for some pussy
Man she got you going crazy, that pussy wavy
She texting me she want my baby, but that's your lady
You be blowing her phone up, fucking my dome up
Nigga you cockblocking, act like a grown up
You was a happy couple until Young Lito shown up
I patch you in with another I got the shit sewn up

[King Sevin:]
Yea
This ain't new to me, it's not you its me
I be killing all these bitches nigga, read the eulogy
Don't be making all these threats about what you gon' do to me
Cause I took your number one and I made her my two or three
Give a fuck about your lady cause she just something to get into
I scooped her out my mentions, nigga she ain't never mention you
Just a bunch of questions about all the shit I done been into
Nowadays conversations turn into interviews
Cause when you on the come up and they see you about to make it
That pussy getting wet, you become they fascination
She dream about you daily, so reality she make it
Don't take it personal, she want it so she take it
Gotta keep your bitch in check, she gon' show out if you let her
Have you send your [?] have you wishing you never met her
She was an easy kill, nigga you should probably dead her
Cause I just fucked her to show she could do better

[Avon Blocksdale:]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I put this dick in your daughter, she keep asking, harassing
Fuck I ain't call her
I ain't butcher the box, I slaughtered the pussy
But before I'm a baby, that baby's aborted
I'm out of town with the dope, stretch that caine like a rope
She said she want to [?] swear I laughed, almost choked
She said you take me for joke?
I said go stay with your folks
Too busy getting this paper, got my emotions [?]
How the fuck is you mad off a bitch you just fucking?
She swallow dick, you swapping spit
Man that shit be disgusting
You pressing me about a bitch that took her in no discussing
You out here lusting and trusting?
While your bitch out here slutting?
Damn!
