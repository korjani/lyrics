[Intro: Troy Ave]
You don't talk to the people, you gotta talk to them on some shit like this

[Hook:]
Give me a minute, I just wanna vent
I want a mortgage, I don't want a rent
I gotta Benz, now I want a Bent'
I need a come-up like a fuckin' tent

[Verse 1:]
One time for the hood, that's what I'm coming from
Dope deals, now Mil's and I ain't judgin' nothin'
Get your money and respect, all at the same time
Multi task force on us, all for the same crimes
Criminal mind, go to school, or go out and mob
I know people with they diploma who ain't got a job
Times get hard if you let it, I sell soft I don't sweat it
Hope I never regret it, but being [?]
Fuck that I need more out of life
I'm a get it with the white, or get it with what I write
It ain't right, but it's wrong to be lying in these songs
So I don't, 'cause I can't, wait a minute let me vent
Man these fake niggas on, talkin' shit that ain't real
I just do, what I do and I hustle in my field
Stay the fuck up out my lane, steal my joy bring you pain
All these rappers dress the same, is it me? Or that's lame, I'm just sayin'

[Hook:]
Give me a minute, I just wanna vent
I want a mortgage, I don't want a rent
I gotta Benz, now I want a Bent'
I need a come-up like a fuckin' tent
So I'm speedin', right now while I'm breathin'
Don't know when I'm leavin', tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes, grind time mother pearl
I be out here tryna get it
It's just me against the world baby [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I remember being broke twice in my life
Couldn't pay my rent, cable bill, or my light
Cold showers filled with questions, what I'm gonna do?
Move in with my ex or back with mom dukes?
How I'm a look to my little brother and sister? Damn
What if she look through my phone and start to bitch again
Big bro broke I can follow in his path
Sell gold ropes, locks, chains, patented bags
Livin' off others eventually comes to an end
Now you lost in this world and you done lost a friend
That ain't no way to be, can't respect those who do
I ain't a crippled or kid, so I got up and do
What had to be done, haters wished I would fold
The only thing I drop is jewels, here's some to you all
You can live within your means, you ain't gotta ball
Most the people that you impress and don't got shit at all

[Hook:]
Give me a minute, I just wanna vent
I want a mortgage, I don't want a rent
I gotta Benz, now I want a Bent'
I need a come-up like a fuckin' tent
So I'm speedin', right now while I'm breathin'
Don't know when I'm leavin', tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes, grind time mother pearl
I be out here tryna get it
It's just me against the world baby [x2]
