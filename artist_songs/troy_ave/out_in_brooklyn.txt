[Hook: Avon Blocksdale]
Out In Brooklyn nigga we gets busy
Goons on the corner holding that mac trizzy
My niggas out here raw nigga soldiers ready for war
Speaking on what you saw we appearing at your door
Bucking off 5, my homie got 6
Other homie neutral but steady aiming the grip
Homie I like your chain, homie I like your watch
Now hand over that shit before the nina start to spark, Brooklyn shit

[Verse 1: Avon Blocksdale]
Package the plate 8 with the weight baking the cake
Cut so I can increase the stakes destiny for great
So I put [?] on the [?] likes Heinz on the crate
Y'all were dishing dimes likes Kidd in his prime
No kid touching mine really got them hoes on the line
Kept the toast cause they coach got declined
Different from most when I boast it's all truth
My niggas front line any beef like war troops
Top of the game me and mine in fine suits
You can keep the happy just give me mine in cash
No give me mine fast before this Rubin start to blast
I'm so Brooklyn your jewels get tooken
Wear your shit in front of you and ask why you looking
In the 718 play with death and get played
Or the 187 better walk with a step kid
Or your're going to meet a youngin' with a mac trying to grow him some chest hairs

Go Brooklyn [x7]

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
He got that Cuban link on iced out watch
Homie don't know he shining on the wrong block
Them young boys strapped up and they starved
And they just copped some work and the feigns saying it's gone
They got no respect for the chick he came to visit mane
To them homie looking like 350 grams, BK home of the Nets you know where we stay
We straight when we start cutting there ain't no DJ
Buck 50 or pull out the mac and dump 50
Niggas that like me and Troy Ave used to bump 50
I stay strapped back it up when I pop shit
I shot at niggas from Queens when he got cocky

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
Ayo Avon Blocksdale I'm going to come thorugh on some hot shit
Off the record I murdered somebody Uncle on the block (Allegedly)
Now you hear me on the record with Uncle Murda and Block
Still Killing shit and still dealing bricks
I just sold 1500 grams after 36 (PowdeRRR)
My homie from CT said he need some pedico
I met him off the highway by Essex and we go
I tell it like it is cause that's the way it happened
More keys than a laptop got me straight macking
Some bitches over here and some bitches over there
Strapped in the pussy in and out paranoid feeling fair
The baby or the bud niggas spraying me with slugs either way I'm pulling out
And I'm shooting in they mugs, man what the fuck
How this nigga up? that's a hater voice when the see me in the club and I bust it up
I put a face to the voice and stuck him up
I don't want the chain I just did it cause I could motherfucker
