Ain’t got no time to open your legs
Girl, give me that head (girl, give me that head)
Just give me that head (just give me that head)

Whether on the couch or on the bed
Girl, give me that head

Ain’t got no time to open your legs
Just give me that head
Just give me that head (just give me that head)

Girl, give me that head

Sacrifice your bitch to me [x2]
It ain’t your mother, nigga you’ve got others
Won’t you sacrifice your bitch to me?

[Verse 1 - Young Lito:]
At the club they swarm me
All these bitches be on me
Keep the name, I know the game
I just want some brain like a zombie
No Walking Dead, I don’t need no bed
Oh, you’re pussy good? I’ll take some head
Ain’t cuffin’ nothin’, I’m not a Fed
I’m ‘a take you down, or your friend instead
I am not an officer, when I’m done I am tossing ya
To the curb, I know you heard
Now tell your friends, baby spread the word

[Hook - Troy Ave]

[Verse 2 - A$AP Ferg:]
I met her at club Lust, she was stripping on the pole
[?], she said come her cause I know you want to put it on me
It's time to get fucked up, she spilling all her Henny on me
[?], girl give me head but don't put no hickey on it
I got you motherfuckin' feeling like [?]
I walk up out the club with your bitch like I'm fuckin' [?]
A couple hating niggas talking you don't even know me, girl I told you these motherfuckers phony
Why you cuffin' like the police?
Your girl seen you coming but she too busy sucking on me
She said I'm balling with my gold teeth and my rollie
I be running through her mouth like I'm [?]

[Hook - Troy Ave]

[Verse 3 - Young Lito:]
I just want head in a comfortable bed
It can all be so simple
I’m fly as a bitch and your body is thick
But girl I want your mental
