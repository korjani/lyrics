[Intro:]
You know what time it is?
Back to work nigga
It's the word of DJ Holiday
Yea
They call me Holiday Sinatra
On 1st number classics
You'd better check your archives nigga
We workin
It's lil umblrella right here, Cray L
Powder, cocaine, all the shit you like
You know? This is White Christmas right here, right?
This is that Crown right, shit you like right
[?]
Let's go!

[Hook:]
I ain't come here to socialize, I don't care, probably know you guys
One focus in-between my eyes: get rich rich rich rich
Self-made and it feels so good
Fuck ya'll, we made the hood
All my homies if I save a dig,
That bitch ditch bitch ditch
Bang bang, no playin
We sling cocaine
My watch, my chain
Yea nigga, cocaine
Why I need a record deal when I deal nigga?
Powder, it feels good to be a real nigga

[Verse:]
I am that nigga,
Yea say something, big tip fly
I took a vay-k in my villa
It's your bitch who felt no guilt
I know you wanna do it the same
I know you wanna cruise in my lane
For you wannabe's I made a song
Feel free to sing along, this shit is so straight
I got the hottest tape on the streets
I got the fishy flake on the streets
Can no other niggas compete
With my oven bake or a B
Hottest tape on the streets
I got the fishy flake on the streets
Can no other niggas compete
With my oven bake or a B
All that tight pan shit trashy
All that weirdo shit trashy
All that fake Rolex, watch gold
With no righteous jury for the fact
Real niggas deal coke (powder)
Real niggas deal dope (powder)
Couple hundred pounds of that out the ground
On the track to get what they'll smoke
I'm with a bitch, my niggas on D-low
I don't socialize with new people
Got a snubby on my heard me so
I don't play Jack, Tim Teebow

[Hook:]
I ain't come here to socialize, I don't care, probably know you guys
One focus in-between my eyes: get rich rich rich rich
Self-made and it feels so good
Fuck ya'll, we made the hood
All my homies if I save a dig,
That bitch ditch bitch ditch
Bang bang, no playin
We sling cocaine
My watch, my chain
Yea nigga, cocaine
Why I need a record deal when I deal nigga?
Powder, it feels good to be a real nigga
