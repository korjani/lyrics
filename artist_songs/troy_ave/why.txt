Bitch ass niggas bring my name up a lot
I guess its cause a nigga really came up a lot
I'm so fucking hood I took the name from my block
DopeBoy Troy I cook cocaine up a lot
Selling whole keys I am not these rap niggas
Came in this game rich that's a fact nigga
Clear to see I really live what I rap nigga
Rappers taking shots but I really clap niggas
Really in the hood driving 6 figure foreigns
Really pay cash not with that owing or borrowing
He ain't get a rollie 'til he got a deal nigga
I bought me some rollies off the drugs I deal nigga
And I iced it out so bitch respectful it's a [?]
I'm a young OG that's fucking OG nigga's daughters
And they must respect it because they feel so
Nigga in that pussy might as well be a real one
I got children two sons Roro and Renso
New guns who wanna get hit with an extendo
Busting at these bird ass niggas like Nintendo
I play in Versace I'm done wearing that corny Kenzo

Why these rap niggas be on dick, why?
Why they like a bitch?
Why they jumping clique to clique, why?
Why they faking pumps?
Why I'm really with the shit?
Why am I so real, why?
Why I'm really rich, really rich?

I be taking guns out the hands of suckers
Ankle bracelet on me man this shit ain't justice
Bullet holes in me but I'm physically painless
Don't come around me if you ain't with it, I'm dangerous
Look up to the sky and I pray to the lord
I don't look up to none of these rappers they frauds
I bought a new crib 'bout to buy me a spur
I just bought big, betting points on the spurs
Bought my bitch a watch and a nice lil coat
Soon as the weather great I'm a buy me a boat
Bullet in my head still ain't fuck up the wave
It hurt to get a fade so I grew me some braids
Balmain pants on me take 'em off fuck a bitch
Diamonds dance on me cause I'm black and I'm rich
They telling lies on me saying a real nigga snitched
My reply only eat a real nigga dick
Look, niggas jumping clique to clique, disgusting
Niggas pumping but they bitch, don't trust them
Me I get a lot of chicks, so I'm ruffling
The feathers on these bird ass niggas, fuck 'em
I'm the self-made, self-paid dope boy, jefe, Troy Ave
Coming up out the city letting lead spray
Self-made, self-paid, dope boy, jefe, Troy Ave
Coming up out the city letting lead spray
