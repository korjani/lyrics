1, 2 1, 2 counting millions
Not bad for a nigga from the mud
I'm a pretty rich thug word

[Hook:]
On my birthday looking like I hit the lotto
Free money, free my dawgs out the ya'll know!
God is Great and the Paper Straight
If you ain't seen a real nigga let me demonstrate!
On my birthday like I hit the lotto
Free money, free my dawgs out the ya'll know!
God Is Great and the Paper Straight
If you ain't seen a real nigga let me demonstrate!

Troy Ave the wave all these niggas draws
Biting style frauds all across the board
Why can't I find friends like me lord?
Genuine love loyal like a dog
I ain't got no roof on a few V's
I ain't got no loose spent it on a few keys
Real dealers know worth work more than cash
Three hundred K for coke for a hundred bag
Traffic out of state for the bigger flip
In a small town buying bigger clips
Running down on niggas with a fucking thirty
Make sure they feel and you fucking heard me
Throwing on these balleys heading out the door
Before I leave, baby ask me what you trying to know
My favorite thing is dough, favorite word is no
Favorite color white it represent the blow

[Hook]

Dope Boy Troy a real gun clapper
Don't ask me about no bum rappers
I only listen to my heart and my intuition
I'm only hearing valleys shit, I ain't on no fake shit
Getting women like ya boy a gopher
Then I drive 'em crazy so I'm wearing loafers
My newest boo like to wear a lot of Fendi
She like the Grand Marnier that I mix with Henny
Legs match the ass she for real thick
Hopping out my whip hopping on my dick
Rider for me baby, ride it till you cum
Don't stop when you tired, stop when I'm done
Versace swear suits only its valore
I ain't sweating though, I finesse it boy!
Fucking with some gangsta shit the long way
All about the money like my song say!

[Hook]

Big bread in the big heart on my chest
My pop gone now I'm shootin' like Russel West
Guaranteed I'm scoring young nigga balling
You ain't hear about it one of these moments
It ain't no real niggas mourning
They won't come see me even when I'm touring
Ain't the first time, I've been through it often
The most that you'll shine will put you in a coffin!
Troy Ave!
