[Intro:]
If she thick and you get her pregnant she just going to become fat
And you gonna be the nigga with the big bitch just know that
B$B reign supreme on the east side of things you heard

[Verse - Troy Ave:]
I came to tell my story more guts than glory
First love was Kimore' my first gun was a .40
Put me in the drug game sold 10 dimes for Jordans
I was barely 15 then if moms knew she would bust me
Upside of my head beat my ass half dead
Still got that bread made 30 grand of freight
A OG still owe me 3 thou' worth of OD
But he live across my crib and if I dipped that'd be OD
Beside that we don't play, with the bullshit like older lady
Son of a bitch swung at me, I shot him on Mothers Day
Right there by the blade shop snowy night, no rain drops
Bang Bang feel the pain drop felt no remorse my name hot

[Hook - Troy Ave:]
My foot up smoke up g macking like so what
Then its hold up roll up gonna see a bottle when we show up
I do not let shit just slide
I will not [?] my pride
Niggas going to play you if you let em, play you if you let em
They going to play you if you let em, man fuck that shit just wet em
I do not let shit just slide
I will not [?] my pride
Real niggas relate

[Verse - Troy Ave:]
No games but I showboat my dough came from selling coke
Blow stacks bought a crib an toast and a brick house with room from growth
Cut short all the slick ones side talk for the victims
Creep good so I sleep good let this Chi nigga get them

[Verse - Fredo Santana:]
Got a .30 and a .40 try me and I blow that
These niggas act tough in they pictures and I know that
Glo'd up with a cameraman take some pictures it's Kodak
You could have the bitch I don't want her and your new bitch is my throwback
Call up Troy Ave he said he got them bricks for me
Got a bad bitch who drive them but she don't get a nick from me
Ride around with my pistol, Nigga high but I'm sitting low
Ride around with my pistol, Nigga high but I'm sitting low
Trap house with the K with me please don't play with me
These niggas sweet like swishers man they make believe
Trap life drug life shit that was made for me
Front street double SR thats the agency

[Hook - Troy Ave:]
My foot up smoke up g macking like so what
Then its hold up roll up gonna see a bottle when we show up
I do not let shit just slide
I will not [?] my pride
Niggas going to play you if you let em, play you if you let em
They going to play you if you let em, man fuck that shit just wet em
I do not let shit just slide
I will not [?] my pride
Real niggas relate
