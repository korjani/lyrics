Locked in the jail but I'm gon' get free
I wear icy gold chains, can't no brass break me
Pussy nigga tried to assisaniate me
I took the gun from him and turned the tables 'round like a G
RIP my real nigga B-A-N-G
Couldn't make your funeral but I heard that you was flee
Riding through the sky, know the luggage Louis V
When we get to heaven's doors save your boy a spare key
You in a better place but I'm sad and enraged
Try not to let tears fall on the page
It's been a few days and a nigga still hurting
If you was here you would say I hope you still working
Can't explain the pain with a whole dictionary
There's nothing to explain, you niggas fiction-ary
Find out what's up when the shit goes down
And you fighting for you life, not a homeboy around
Fuck 'em if they frauds, I'm fucking with the lord
You never let me down, never ran out the door
The fake help you appreciate the real more
This opened up my eyes and shit I never would've saw
I'm OD stressed but I'm OD blessed
And the khakis and Obamas in the back getting rest
Using this time to get ready for the grind
Just like the saying when I rise I'm a shine
I'm innocent
It ain't the end of Troy Ave, not at all
This just the beginning
I'm innocent
Unless you charging me with being real From the very beginning
I'm innocent
That's a facto
Can't even finish the rest dog
