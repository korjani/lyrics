That first little kiss from your school sweetheart
Parked in the dark in your parents car
Take her by the hand, gaze in her eyes
Feel the first flutter of them butterflies

That's what love'll get ya
Don't let anybody tell you different
I've been in and out enough to vouch
That's what love'll get ya

You're impressin' her Daddy, kissing up to her Mom
Saving up money for the Senior Prom
Runnin' wide open when she slams on the brakes
Next thing you know you got your first heartache

That's what love'll get ya
Don't let anybody tell you different
I've been in and out enough to vouch
That's what love'll get ya

It'll get ya thinkin', ain't love sweet?
When she's finally willin' and you just can't wait
It'll get ya in might deep
That first time you ever go all the way
It'll get ya house payments on a thirty year plan
Get behind the wheel of your first mini van
A wife and two kids, a boy and a girl
Hot feet walkin' around Disney World
That's what love'll get ya
Don't let anybody tell you different
I've been in and out enough to vouch
That's what love
That's what love'll get ya
Don't let any fool tell you different
I've been in and out enough to vouch
That's what love'll get ya
Yeah, that's what love'll get ya
Oh, that's what love'll get ya
