It was just another night in the hayfield
'Til she climbed down off of them four wheels,
Yeah, yeah

Soon as that sundress hit the headlights
Every tailgate way out there was like yeah, yeah

She started walking over to me
Like she already knew me
Sat down right beside me
And asked if I was here alone

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

She brought me a cup and I tried it
A little fruity but she asked if I liked it
So I said yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Then she played me some band on her iPod
Kinda hit me kinda hippie and I thought, "Naw."
But I said yeah, yeah, yeah

She said you wanna take a walk
To the river maybe cool off
She said, "I know a good spot."
And then she took my hand

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

A little later under that full moon
I didn't want the night to end too soon
I said, "It's getting late, do you need to go?"
And she said no

I was like,
Yeah, yeah,
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah,
Girl, if you say so
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
