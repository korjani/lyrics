I always get the door for a lady, I don't care if she's 4 or if she's 80
I don't need a Jag, I got a tractor, and I won't apologize for things that matter
Pop a cold beer after five, drop everything go wet a line
I believe in the USA, 4 wheel drives and Jesus Saves

Freaks like me, just outside the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a can, 'cause I'm a fan
Of everyone whose turned out to be
Freaks like me

Yeah, I can't seem to smell or tell the difference
Between a pile of bull and a pile of politicians
Give me old folks and old boots
And Deep fried and deep roots and
Six packs and six strings and blue collar blue jeans,

Freaks like me, just outside the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a can, 'cause I'm a fan
Of everyone whose turned out to be
Freaks like me
Freaks like me

Pop a cold beer after five, drop everything go wet a line
I believe in the USA, 4 Wheel Drives and Jesus Saves

Freaks like me, just outside the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a can, 'cause I'm a fan
Of everyone whose turned out to be
Freaks like me
Freaks like me
What you get is what you see
Freaks like me
Yeah, freaks like me
