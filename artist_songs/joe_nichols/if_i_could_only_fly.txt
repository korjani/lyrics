I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing somewhere everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And the sad songs for us to bare

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile

Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we could somehow get away
And I wish you could come with me when I go again

If I could only fly, if we could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and no more lonely nights
