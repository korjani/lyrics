Me and Kid Sensation and that home away from home-
In the Black Benz Limo, with the cellular phone-
I'm callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'-
The freaks a need a sunroof, to keep you sucka's trippin'-
Everybody's lookin, if your jealous turn around-
The AMG kick keeps us closer to the ground-
we're gettin' good grip from the 50 series tires-
the Alpine's bumpin', but I need the volume higher-
cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb-
we're rollin' Rainier, and the jealous wanna get some-
Every time we do, the sucka M.C.'s wanna battle-
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle-
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson-
headed for the strip, yes we're lookin' for some action-
the limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leanin' back-
Maharaji's watchin' T.V. with two girlies on his lap-
On Martin Luther King.....the set looks kinda dead-

we need a new street so posse move ahead-
we all look kinda' SWASS the crew you can't forget-
the Mix-a-lot posse co' rippen' up the set-

My Posse's on Broadway........

UhhhRrrollin' with my posse we're gettin' kinda' bored-
there's not another posse with more points scored-
we don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas-
my homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa'-
Maharaji's on the def side dancin' like a freak-
the girlies see his booty and their knees get weak-
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny -
a real estate investa' who makes a lot of money-
Clockin' lots of dollas' we all got gold-
cruzin' in the Benz ain't got no place to go-
wheelin' 23rd we saw nuthin' but thugs-
the girlies was too skinny from smokin' all them drugs-
cause the rock man got 'em and their butts just dropped-
the freaks looked depressed 'cause the Benz won't stop-
at 23rd and Union the driver broke left-
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def-
my girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best-
she's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress-
the closer that we get, the crazier that I feel-
the posse's on Broadway it's time to get ill-

My Posse's on Broadway.........

Cruzin' Broadway and my wheels spin slow-
rollin with my posse is the only way to go -
the girlies by the college was lookin for a ride-
we tried to pick them up but we had no room inside-
we put them on the trunk, we put them on the hood-
some sat up with the driver they made him feel good-
the posse's gettin' bigger, there's much too many freaks-
the muffler's draggin', my suspension's gettin' weak-
Now the posse's gettin' hungry, and Mix-a-Lot's treatin'-
we stopped at Taco Bell, for some Mexican eatin'-
but Taco Bell was closed, and the girls was on my tip-
they said, "Go back the other way, we'll stop and eat at Dick's"-
Dick's is the place where the crew hang out-
the SWASS like to play, and the rich flaunt clout-
posse to the burger stand, so big we walk in two's-
we're gettin' dirty looks, from those other sucka crews-
Kid Sensation dropped a $20, and didn't even miss it-
skeeza from anotha' crew, she picked it up and kissed it-
her boyfriend's illin', he went to slap her face-
My homeboy P.L.B. co' sprayed the boy with mace-
'Cause I never liked a punk, who beat up on his girl-
if you don't have game, then let her leave your world-
We took the girl with usssssss....with him she rode the busssss....
she gave the boy the finga', and the sucka starts to cussssss....
boy I gotta def posse, you gotta bunch of dudes-
you're broke co' cryin' bout the rock-man blues-
you beat up on your girl, and now you're all upset-
she's with the Mix-a-Lot posse, on the Broadway set-

My posse's on Broadway.............
