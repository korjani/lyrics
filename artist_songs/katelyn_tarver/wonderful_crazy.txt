Welcome to a new day 
Don't know what's on the way 
But whatever it is I'll be ready 
On your mark get set go 
Here's the show and the road 
But with you it's a load I can carry 
And with each breath I would take it 
Every moment gonna make it 

[CHORUS]
It's a wonderful crazy 
It's a beautiful out of control 
Kinda scary amazing 
But I don't really mind at all 
It's like I'm falling, flying, laughing, crying 
Hanging on and letting go 
Cause my life' so wonderful crazy crazy 

Some days get intense 
And breakdown my defense 
But I'm here and I'm not giving up 
Gonna take in the sights 
On the ride of my life 
Living just to survive's not enough 
So much love to discover 
I don't need any other 

[REPEAT CHORUS]
It's a beautiful crazy 
It's a beautiful out of control 
Kinda scary amazing 
But I don't really mind at all
