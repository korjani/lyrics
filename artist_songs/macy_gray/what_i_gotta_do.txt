Oooooooooh

Yeah, Girl a boy and a girl,
Never thought I'd have babies,
Looking up to me,
Wanna give them all the world,
Yeah, trying to make it, always gone,
You say, mommy don't go, ooh ooh,
And I don't wanna leave, uh uh (I don't wanna leave).

It's what I gotta do,
There's no place that I'd rather be than there with you,
It's what I gotta do to take care of you,
Make it right, ooh (make it right, make it right)
And I never make it,
But I have to hope you understand the circumstances,
I'll be there the second I get the chance,
What I gotta do.

Yeah, only you can rely,
Wanna give you the best of everything,
So I miss some things,
But you're always on my mind (always on my mind)
Yeah, I'm gonna show you the world,
But it ain't easy, ooh ooh,
But I don't wanna leave you (I don't wanna leave).

It's what I gotta do,
There's no place that I'd rather be than there with you,
It's what I gotta do to take care of you, (oh yeah)
Make it right, ooh (make it right, make it right)
And I never make it,
But I have to hope you understand the circumstances,
I'll be there the second I get the chance, (I'll be there)
What I gotta do.

Stars are in your eyes,
The sun is in your flower,
Easy to my churches,
You show me what my purpose is,
Girl, a boy, and a girl,
Sweetest in my world (sweetest in my world)
Hey hey, hey hey heyyyyyaaaah.

It's what I gotta,

It's what I gotta take, ooooh.

It's what I gotta do,
There's no place that I'd rather be than there with you,
It's what I gotta do to take care of you, (a girl, a boy, and a girl)
Make it right, ooh (make it right, make it right)
And I never make it,
But I have to hope you understand the circumstances,
I'll be there the second I get the chance,
What I gotta do.
What I gotta do.
What I gotta do.
What I gotta do.
