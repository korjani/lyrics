My baby works down at the boulevard café 
Just a fine young man with big dreams 
Trying to make his wn way 
The owner is this man ole bitch who degrades 
Him everyday 
Then she fires him for no reason 
Don't wanna give him for no reason 
I've committed murder and I think I got away 
I'm hiding at my mother's house corne get me right away 
Right away 
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
We're gonna get the next plane outer here and fly away 
Fly away 

When he's down it breaks my heart to see him 
So I figured I'd talk to her woman to woman 
I walk in and she's countin her cash 
Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture 
I said, "give him the little bit of money you owe him" 
She said" get back bitch I ain't givin you shit" 
I said, "you ole bag, maybe you ain't heard but them are 
Fightin words" 
I've committed murder and I think I got away 
I'm hiding at my mother's house corne get me right away 
Right away 
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
We're gonna get the next plane outer here and fly away 
Fly away 

And I don't feel bad about it 
See baby there was this struggle 
And I don't feel bad about it 
As a result of our struggle 
And I don't feel bad about it 
But the good thing is 
And I don't feel bad about it 
We don't have to struggle no more 

With a suitcase full of money 
We flew to a Jamaican paradise 
One thing I've learned through all of this is 
Having money sure is nice 
Me and my baby got married 

He's working hard to make his dreams came true 
As far as regrets I don't have any 
Would You? 
I've committed murder and I think I got away 
I'm hiding at my mother's house corne get me right away 
Right away 
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
We're gonna get the next plane outer here and fly away 
Fly away
