All I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony 
I could dance in the raw in the sun underneath the stars 
When I walk over to my money tree ain't nobody there 
Trying to take from me 
When they ask "Are you truly free?" I'd say "Yes, truly" 
But down here in really everybody knows there ain't 
No such thing 
And It's clear 
It's obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be 
On and on and on I've searched 
What I'm looking for is not here on earth 
I can't stand I can't take no more 
So I know that I goota go 
So long everybody 
Mama don't be sad for me 
Life was a heartache and now I am finally free 
Don't know where I'm headed 
Hope I see you someday soon 
So long everybody 
I have gone beyond the moon 

All I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony 
Just to be live and shine 
When I get ready I up and fly 
And I can't remember none of the things that I want 
To forget 
It's the best - satisfaction no less 
Ask if I'm free and I'll say "Oh yes" 
But down here in really everybody knows there ain't 
No such thing 
And It's clear 
It's obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be 
On and on and on I've searched 
What I'm looking for is not here on earth 
I can't stand I can't take no more 
So I know that I goota go 
So long everybody 
Mama don't be sad for me 
Life was a heartache and now I am finally free 
Don't know where I'm headed 
Hope I see you someday soon 
So long everybody
