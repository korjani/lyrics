Hey white man I am not my grandmother
I'm from the city Canton Ohio
I'm just a lady but I think like a man
You hating me and I don't understand
You're judging me, you wanna send me to hell
God is my father and I got my ban
You come for me, let me make it clear
I'll whoop your woooo [x5]

Hey white man you can best believe I matter
Now I'm offended by [?]
But I'm living good on the edge of myself
I'll make a drink and I toast you my hell
Let's go together, let's make it better
Let's go together, let's make it better
If you don't agree I'll make it clear
I'll whoop your woooo [x5]

(Let's go together, let's make it better
Let's go together, let's make it better)
If you don't agree I'll make it clear

I'll whoop your
I'll whoop your woooo
I'll whoop your
I'll whoop your woooo
I'll whoop your woooo
