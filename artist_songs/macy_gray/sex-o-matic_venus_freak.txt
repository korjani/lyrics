Superlove is something that they say is very rare 
In the dark, In your world it's everywhere 
And I feel like an x x rated movie star 
It's the way you love me down 
It's the way you love me down 
Everytime we kiss you bring out the woman in me 
Everytime you holler out my name you set me free 
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to 
I am the automatic easy freak all over you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to. 

Superlove 
Gimme some, some, some. 
We are the genius of love 
Feel like an x x rated movie star 
It's the way you love me down 
It's the way you love me down 
Everytime we kiss you bring out the woman in me 
Everytime you holler out my name you set me free 
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to 
I am the automatic easy freak all over you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to. 

When we seek and hide 
When my hands are tied 
69 positions and 
whip cream all over my skin 
lick you from bottom to root 
love to get down with you 
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to 
I am the automatic easy freak all over you 
And I will stop it only when you tell me to.
