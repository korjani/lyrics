I'm so happy you're here
It's been a long time since I've had you near my dear,
Come on inside get away from the cold wind that's blowin,
Gonna let you know,that

I'm so glad you're here
I worried about'ya,
I'm so glad you're here,
After all we've been through,
I'm so glad you're here,
It's good to see ya baby,
I'm so glad you're here,

Leave your troubles out,
Yeah they come to mind every time I see you around town,
Be frontin like ya got it all together,
But I'm no better,
baby it's you and I forever

[Chorus]

Woah love, aint nothin' changed
we're still hopeless together,
woah,-oh
I wish you were goin, for I'm doomed if you stay,
It's okay,
I need you anyways,
It's okay,

It's okay,
And I need you, Anyway
and I'm so happy you're here,

I'm so glad you're here,
I'm so glad you're here,
Together,
I'm so glad you're here,
I'm so glad you're here
