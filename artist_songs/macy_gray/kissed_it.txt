Ooh, rain be pourin' down 
Every day my mind is cloudy 
Got enough tears to fill the sea 
They say that I'm a drag 
Tell me, I be lookin' sad and nobody wants to party with me 
And it's because of you, the shitty things you do 
The low ways that you treat me, endlessly 
I was gonna leave you 'til you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I wanted to leave you, then you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I was gonna leave you, then you dipped it (Dipped it) 
Baby you fixed it (Fixed it) when you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I don't wanna fight baby 
Kiss it (Kiss it) 'cause I miss it (Miss it) 
Make it alright (Alright) 
Boy you light a fire in me 

Ooh, you treat me like a dog 
Tell me all I do is wrong 
Treat me like I wear a training bra 
You push my love away, then you come to save the day 
Then the next thing I be seein' ya with other girls in the club 
It don't feel like lovin' me 
I was gonna leave you 'til you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I wanted to leave you, then you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I was gonna leave you, then you dipped it (Dipped it) 
Baby you fixed it (Fixed it) when you kissed it (Kissed it) 
I don't wanna fight baby 
Kiss it (Kiss it) 'cause I miss it (Miss it) 
Make it alright (Alright) 
Boy you light a fire in me
