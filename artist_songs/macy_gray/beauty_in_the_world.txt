I know you're fed up 
Like a lead up for us 
All they talk about is 
What is going down? 
What's been messed up for us? 
When I look around I see blue skies 
I see butterflies for us 

Listen to the sound and lose it 
Its sweet music and dance with me 
There is beauty in the world 
So much beauty in the world 
Always beauty in the world 
So much beauty in the world 
Shake your booty boys and girls for the beauty in the world 
Pick your diamond pick your pearl there is beauty in the world 
All together now 

We need more lovin' 
We need more money, they say 
Change is gonna come 
Like the weather 
They say forever 
They say 
When they're in between 
Notice the blue skies 
Notice the butterflies 
Notice me 

Stop and smell the flowers 
And lose it the sweet music and dance with me 
There is beauty in the world 
So much beauty in the world 
Always beauty in the world 
There is beauty in the world 
Shake your booty boys and girls for the beauty in the world 
Pick your diamond pick your pearl there is beauty in the world 
All together now 

Heya throw your hands up and holla 
Throw your hands up and holla 
When you don't know what to do 
Don't know if you'll make it through 
Remember god is giving you beauty in the world 
So love (Beauty in the world) 
Yeah love (Beauty in the world) 

There is beauty in the world (Beauty in the world)
