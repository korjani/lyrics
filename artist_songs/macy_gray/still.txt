In my last years with him there were bruises 
On my face 
In my dawn and new day 
I finally got away 
But my head's all messed up and he knows 
Just what to say 
No more dawn and new days 
I'm goin back to stay 
Why say bye bye 
When it only makes me cry 
I still 
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up 
I still 
Melt down like a candle burnin everytime we touch 
Oh say what you will 
He does me wrong and I should be gone 
I still 
Be lovin you baby and it's much too much 

We are goin down 
Cuz you're always getting high 
And your crumb and lovin 
No longer get me by 
Wow! It get better everytime that we get high 
Then your crumbs of lovin 
They somehow get me by 
Why say bye bye 
When it only makes me cry 
I still 
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up 
I still 
Melt down like a candle burnin everytime we touch 
Oh say what you will 
He does me wrong and I should be gone 
I still 
Be lovin you baby and it's much too much 

Can't I go my severed way? 
Some rain for my sunny day 
Not even one reason to say 
Why? 
I should've left you 
Why? 
I can't forgetcha baby 
Why? 
Ever since I mathca it's 
Why?
