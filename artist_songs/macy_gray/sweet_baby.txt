Many times I've been told that I should go 
but they dont know
what we got baby 
then they not see the love in you 
but love i do 
and i'm staying right here

ummm sweet sweet baby life is crazy
but there's one thing 
i am sure of
that I'm your lady 
always baby 
and I love you now and ever

Suga wishes dont change what is real
or how it feels in the bad times
forever he is, he's mine all the time
and we get by with our true love

ummm sweet sweet baby life is crazy
but there's one thing 
i am sure of
that I'm your lady 
always baby 
and I love you now and ever

ummm sweet baby life is crazy
but there's one thing 
i am sure of
that I'm your lady 
always baby 
and I love you now and ever

I bet would I ever find, my sweet
just a true love, my sweet
that we come this far together
I bet so I'm here to stay 
cos without you baby 
I cant go any further

ummm sweet baby life is crazy
but there's one thing 
i am sure of
that I'm your lady 
always baby baby
mah mah ever mah mah ever mah mah sweet sweet baby
life is so sweet with you 
sweet with you 
sweet
