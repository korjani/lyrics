We can capture the moment, we don't need a camera
Love the way that you keep it flashing like a cannon
Silent shooter, you got me when I least expected
Working angles, you gettin' me from all directions
Put you on that high definition love
Know I got that high definition touch
Shake that body like polaroids
I'm movin' all night, all night, alright

Don't be camera shy, baby zoom over
Let me get focused
There's a bigger picture, I just wanna show ya
Baby let me hold ya
Ready for my close up
Dying to be with ya

Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer

Don't be camera shy, baby zoom over
Let me get focused
There's a bigger picture, I just wanna show ya
Baby let me hold ya
Ready for my close up
Dying to be with ya

Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
