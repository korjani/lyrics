So why you're here acting like you don't
Wanna be here, dancing on the floor
Don't know really what you're waiting for
For, for yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
Boy, I came here to party
I just wanna keep pressing replay
So turn it up
I love the way it makes me feel
Let's turn it up
'Cause we live that life

[Chorus:]
We on that all night, get it right
If you keep on moving like that
I might love you forever
We on that first time love high
Just keep on moving
'Cause I just might love you forever

Love you forever
Love you forever

So love the way we going back and forth
Dance until we can't do it no more
Every night, stop it so speed it up, slow it down
Yeah, baby, keep it moving

[Pre-Chorus:]
Boy, I came here to party
I just wanna keep pressing replay
So turn it up
I love the way it makes me feel
Let's turn it up
'Cause we live that life

[Chorus:]
We on that all night, get it right
If you keep on moving like that
I might love you forever
We on that first time love high
Just keep on moving
'Cause I just might love you forever

Love you forever
Love you forever

The way you move is so amazing
So hypnotized, you take me away with you
'Cause you already got me crazy
Crazy

So don't stop, let it rock
Keep moving, keep, keep moving
Let's play it over and over
So don't stop, let it rock
Keep moving, keep, keep moving
Let's play it over and over

[Chorus:]
We on that all night, get it right
If you keep on moving like that
I might love you forever
We on that first time love high
Just keep on moving
'Cause I just might love you forever

Love you forever
Love you forever

So why you're here acting like you don't
Wanna be here, dancing on the floor
Don't know really what you're waiting for
For
