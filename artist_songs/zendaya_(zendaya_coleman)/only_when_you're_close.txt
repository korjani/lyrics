Only when you're close
Only when you're close

All this time you weren't even on my mind
Who would've know that you'd be
Be the one in a million I need

Won't deny, I just want you by my side
Who would've thought that I'd be
Be so incomplete with just me

[Chorus:]
I can't catch my breath
Only when you're close
My heart drops out my chest
Only when you're close
I get so, get so wild
Only when you're close
I can't stop and I found
It's only when you're, only when you're
Close, close, close, close

How do you make me feel like just us two
Can live in the world where we know
That we can be free and let go

Hold me tight, so tight that our hearts collide
We live in the world that we own
Yeah, I'm at a place I call home

[Chorus:]
I can't catch my breath
Only when you're close
My heart drops out my chest
Only when you're close
I get so, get so wild
Only when you're close
I can't stop and I found
It's only when you're, only when you're
Close, close, close, close

Only when you're close
Close, close, close
Only, only, only
Let's dance

Only when you're close
It's only when you're, only when you're
Close, close
Close, close
