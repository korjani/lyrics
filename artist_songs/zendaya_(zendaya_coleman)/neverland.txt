Whenever I was frightened 
Or if I ever felt alone
Whenever I was frightened 
Or if I ever felt alone
I turned to the night sky
And a star I call my own
Somewhere I could run to
Just across the Milky Way
If you like I could take you
It's just a light year and a day

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
Bring us back home
In a place so far away 
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
When we find ourselves in Never Neverland 

Through all my make believe 
There's some reality 
In your reflection 
There's much more than you see
All that you hope for 
You hope for today 
Is the love someone gives you
In an unconditional way

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home
In a place so far away 
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
When we find ourselves in Never Neverland

Picture a land you never have seen 
Life is eternal and evergreen 
Future of happiness all in your hands
All in this place I created 
That I call Neverland

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home
In a place so far away 
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
And with your hand in my hand 
I am closer now 
To finding Neverland

And with your hand in my hand
I am closer now
To finding Neverland
Neverland
Neverland
