Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out [x5]

[Verse 1:]
Don't watch me watch the t-t-TV
I'm swaggin' when you se-e-e me
I'm shining bright you'll fall in lo-o-o-ove (in love)
I'm a rider, I ride like a Harley
Start it up and start up the party
Livin' it up swag it out my way
Nicki Minaj havin' "Pink Fridays"

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shalalala make lots of paper
Nananana don't trip off haters
Got my hair it's done, my nails they're done
Swaggin' so on point
All eyes are on me

[Chorus:]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Pretty like Beyoncé, big time like Kanye
I'm a rock out rock out like Green Day
I'm a act out act on no screen play
Swag it out Whassup?

I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out show off like a stunner
I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out stay hotter than the summer

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shalalala make lots of paper
Nananana don't trip off haters
Got my hair it's done, my nails they're done
Swaggin' so on point
All eyes are on me

[Chorus:]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

[Bridge:]
Let the bass bang
Throw your hands in the air (air, air)
Hands in the air (air, air)
Throw-Throw your hands in the air (throw your hands in the air)
Let the bass bang
And throw your hands in the air (throw your hands in the air)
H-H-hands in the air
Throw-Throw your hands in the air

[Chorus:]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
