There was a family filled with cheer and lots of glee
And that special night they couldn't wait to light the Christmas tree
And throughout the town, they'd gather 'round to hear the choir sing
Once upon a time

I reminisce all the things we'd wish Santa would bring
Stockings on the fireplace and bells ringing
Outside we'd go play in the snow make angel wings
Once upon a time

Fireplaces, noels, cozy nights, and fairy tales
Peace amongst family
Yes, we'd laugh a lot, have photo ops, candy canes, and lemon drops
Seasons greetings
We'd throw snowballs, we'd laugh, we'd fall, we'd build snowman
Once upon a time
They who didn't have much we'd share some love throughout the year
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

So remember this, grown-up or kids, never forget
Your once upon a time
