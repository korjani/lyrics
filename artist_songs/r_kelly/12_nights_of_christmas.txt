Come inside, the world is cold
I cuddle you and love you slow
Open arms waiting for you
Girl just call and I'm there for you
Oh what I've got planned tonight
You and I scheduled to fly
So let love take us right off from this room

You look like you could use a friend
Refuse to let loneliness win
No way
Girl this Christmas for Christ's sake

Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Tell me baby now
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?

We'll take a trip around the world
I'd make one wish and you'd be my girl
I believe in Christmas magic baby yeah
Look into each other's eyes
Discover Christmas paradise
Just let me take your body away tonight

You look like you could use a friend
Refuse to let loneliness win
No way
This Christmas for Christ's sake

Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Tell me girl
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?

And the greatest gift of all girl is you here lying next to me
