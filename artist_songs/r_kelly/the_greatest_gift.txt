If you got the Christmas Spirit then sing this
I want to make love for Christmas

We don't have to contemplate girl
Cause we know what we're here for
We don't need to talk about it baby
Just come on in and close the door girl
This holiday makes it a time for giving
So let's lay down and let me express my feelings

When it comes down to the holidays make no mistake I know that
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Christmas Trees and all these things are very dear to me girl but
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Oh I love writing letters, decorating, taking toasts and celebrating, girl but your
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
So let's unwrap tonight
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Make love until the morning light girl
Your lovin' is the greatest gift

This holiday was made for giving
So open up and let me get into your lovin' through the night girl

I promise on this Christmas Night
I'll take good care of you
Who needs a fantasy?
When I'm lyin' here with my dream come true
This holiday was meant for givin' girl
So give me your love baby tonight

When it comes down to the holidays make no mistake I know that
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Christmas Trees and all these things are very dear to me girl but
Your lovin' is the greatest gift ever
Oh I love writing letters, decorating, taking toasts and celebrating, girl but your
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
We can open all the presents but
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Cause baby nothing compares to your love
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Where would Christmas be, tell me baby

Without you here with me
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Nothing can compare baby
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
To the joy you bring to me baby
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
