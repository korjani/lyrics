Ooh baby come on baby
Come on with me baby

Tonight we'll both be flyin'
Grab a hold, let me take you to heaven
Makin' love on a bed of clouds
Take you up with me baby
And we're never comin' down
And I'm gonna fill your stocking with sweet things
Tis the season girl for eternity
Ooo baby come with me

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
Flyin' on my sleigh baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby

Ooo take my hand
From this room I can take you to Christmas Land
I wanna give you all of your gifts baby
And we don't need a tree, all we need is you and me
And I'm gonna fill your stocking with sweet things
Tis the season girl for eternity
Ooo baby won't you come with me

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby

Jingle Bells all the way
Take it to the top, baby don't you stop
Lost in this Christmas groove
And the greatest Christmas gift is you

I wanna take you glidin'
We'll be floatin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh baby
