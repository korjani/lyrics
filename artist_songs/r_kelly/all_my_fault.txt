Nowhere to hide from the truth
Cannot run from what I did to you
There's nowhere for me to point the blame
I did what I did and I'm so ashamed
(That's my bad)
I accuse myself
(That's my bad)
For what has happened here
(That's my bad)
It takes a man who's strong to admit when he's wrong
And so I'm standing here to let you know

It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault

No longer will I act like you caused all of this
Won't turn around the truth no more I've made this nest
Oh you deserve better than what I've shown you
I pray for the chance to make it all up to you
(That's my bad)
I accuse myself
(That's my bad)
For what has happened here
(That's my bad)
It takes a man who's strong to admit when he's wrong
And so I'm standing here to let you know

It's all my fault
Yes It's all my fault
And I'm sorry babe
It's all my fault
Said It's all my fault
It's all my fault
All my

First of all you're not the one whose been untrue
Second of all you deserve someone who's good to you
Third of all the last thing you need is to raise a man
Fourth of all I realise without you I'm lost
Get tired of lying to that mirror on the wall
All of my fingers and I still can't count my flaws
But you hide right in my hands and I dropped the ball

It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
I did it to myself
Said It's all my fault
See I made my bed
It's all my fault
And now I gotta lay in it lay in it lay in it
It's all my fault
No-one else but me
