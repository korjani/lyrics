The phone stopped ringin'
And the door stopped knockin' yeah
Said there's no noise makin' well
Everybody's gone shoppin' yeah
That leaves you and me girl
Finally some privacy

What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
Said it's just you and me
Good lovin' by the Christmas Tree well well

Listen baby I don't have to have
A box of presents givin' to me, no baby
Well see all those gifts and things are fine
But that ain't what I need

Tell me what about some Christmas lovin' baby?
What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
Said it's just you and me baby
Sweet lovin' by the Christmas Tree

I took off early from work
And I turned all friends away yeah
Said I've got nowhere to be hey yeah
Just you and me baby for the rest of the day
I'm starin' at the mistletoe
Come on in and close the door

What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
Said it's just you and me
Good lovin' by the Christmas Tree well well

Said I need you to listen girl
I don't have to have
A box of presents givin' to me, no baby
Well see all those gifts and things are fine
But that ain't what I need
Said it ain't what I need

What about some Christmas lovin' baby?
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Said it's just you and me baby
Sweet lovin' by the Christmas Tree
Talkin' bout some good, good lovin' baby
