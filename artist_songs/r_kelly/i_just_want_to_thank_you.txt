I was down on my luck one night
Then I saw her face
When she make it wind to the drums
All of my problems erased
Your body is paradise
Tonight I'm escaping
Like a shot of tequila
Her love is intoxicating
Oh the way she put it on me I feel like I owe the girl
If i lost it all I still be the richest man in the world
Cause in my sky you're the only star
It's your song you know who you are

And I just want to thank you
And I just want to thank you
And I just want to thank you
Just want to thank you
For giving me that work
