Put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head
We oughta put a chip in your head

Put a chip in your
Put a chip in your

Open up your mind a bit and let me put it in
Piece of Heaven got you saying "R O B O for the win"
I'm ready to attack even if you've got an attitude
You love me
I love you back
Here's how I show my gratitude
So many questions
Well I'm ready with an answer
If you're dying
I'm the chemo to your cancer
Maybe maybe maybe
If you ask me just right
Baby baby baby
Then I'll give it to you all night

Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head

Songs so catchy gonna spread like AIDS
Words so absurd they're like lyric grenades
Had a message so I said I'll be the white boy Drake
Do like him
Give everybody free Chips to take
So they took em and I hook em like some big mouth bass
First I make the Beat Drop
Then you shake your ...
Half a million downloads
No I don't fake
And the labels still avoid me
What a big mistake

Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head
Put a chip in your head, put a chip in your head 

Baby baby baby
Feel the 1, 2, 3
I put it in your head like R.F.I.D.
