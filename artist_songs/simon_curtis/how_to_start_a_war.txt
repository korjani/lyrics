I thought we were meant to be
Thought it'd be you and me
Standing together at the end of the world

I guess that's not what you want
I guess that I should just move on
You tell me how am I to move when I can't even breathe

This is not how you make love
This is not what we signed up for
This is not how it's meant to be
This how you start a war

This is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how you start a war

How to start a war, how to start a wa-a-ar
How to-how to start a war
How to start a wa-a-ar

You thought I'd abandon you
Thought that I'd stranded you
But I was right there holding your hand

But I guess you didn't see
Everything that I thought we would be
I guess I never thought that you would ever leave me here all alone

This is not how you make love
This is not what we signed up for
This is not how it's meant to be
This how you start a war

This is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how you start a war

How to start a war, how to start a wa-a-ar
How to-how to start a war
How to start a wa-a-ar

Bombs are falling, world is stalling
I'm still trying, why are we fighting
Words destroy us, bait and toy us
I still love you, do you love me too

This is not how you make love
This is not what we signed up for
This is not how it's meant to be
This how you start a war

This is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how you start a war

This is not how you make love
This is not what we signed up for
This is not how it's meant to be
This how you start a war

This is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how, this is how, this is how-how
This is how you start a war

How to start a war, how to start a wa-a-ar
How to-how to start a war
How to start a wa-a-ar
