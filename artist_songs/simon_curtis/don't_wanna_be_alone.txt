They say that love is a game
Only played by the dumbest of fools
That the feeling's elusive
And what can you do with a ruse?

''Oh. Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh''

They say that wanting a heart
Is nothing like what people believe
And to give it away
Is something you don't want to need

''Oh. Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh''

Listen to me
I don't wanna be alone
I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold

I get scared sometimes
When I see all the connections happening around me
That fate will evade me
That time will betray me
That future I just don't want to see

''Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh''

Don't wanna be that synapse swerve that missed the nerve
And now is dead for eternity

Listen to me
I don't wanna be alone
I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold

Listen to me
I'm not gonna be alone
I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold

I don't wanna be
I'm not gonna be
I don't wanna be
I'm not gonna be
Lonely anymore
Not gonna be lonely anymore
Don't wanna be lonely anymore
