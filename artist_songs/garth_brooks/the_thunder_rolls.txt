Three thirty in the morning 
Not a soul insight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night 
Raindrops on the windshield 
There's a storm moving in 
He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he never should have been 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 

She's waitin' by the window 
When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him 
Thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain 
A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
And he knows that she knows 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 

[3rd Verse:]
She runs back down the hallway 
To the bedroom door 
She reaches for the pistol 
Kept in the dresser drawer 
Tells the lady in the mirror 
He won't do this again 
Cause tonight will be the last time 
She'll wonder where he's been
