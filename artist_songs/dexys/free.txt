At first I didn't know how I would be without somebody loving me,
Would I be lost inside?
Then from finding out that we could not fix me,
no-one can heal that part of me, I'm better off alone.
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life,
unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be,

They say (If you don't marry you will be lonely) Yeah
(All good men raise a family) yeah, that's not what I see,
In truth some of them they don't seem so happy,
they tolerate their misery, well that is not for me.
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life,
unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be,

I'm free

Sometimes I think I should get some manogamy,
I try and fit into society, just  be like everybody,
but i can never be the same as them,
I don't want to be like them,
I'm a man who must be free.
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life,
unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be,

I'm free

Why would I buy a book when I can join a library?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
