I've gotta get this off my chest.
I'm startin' to feel a little unrest.
Oh every time I check my shoulder
I see you there with a clueless-look on your face
I’ve gotta question your intentions.
You’re playing this one by the book.
Whichever version you're preaching from?
I've sung it once before.

I know, I know you well enough.
(And if I looked hard, if I looked hard enough)
And I know, and I know you well enough.
(And if I looked hard, if I looked hard enough)

If you were so honest,
Why do you break every promise?
With everything that you say,
I take a picture of what happens around me.
You don’t like the size of us now.
We've grown a lot since Hold Me Down.
I can't help but think
You're the only thing in front of me.

I know, I know you well enough.
(Give us a little time, just a little time)
And I know, and I know you well enough.
(Give us a little time, just a little time)

You put a price on everything.
You even tried to put one on me.
I give my all for your benefit.
I'm sick of this shit.

It's not your fault you always claim.
You always cease to take the blame.
I love you all for everything that you do.
But I'm sick and tired of the fucking abuse.
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of this shit .
