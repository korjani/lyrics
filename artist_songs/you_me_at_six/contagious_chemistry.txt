If I could have a minute please
Then I'd bring you to your knees
This contagious chemistry is killing me
Oh you'll never disappear
Until I give permission, dear
'Cause you're always gonna always be knee deep,
(So please)

Dearest enemy, I fear that
You will just lost me along the way
Somewhere between the fake smiles and your free drinks
Please don't smother me, I swear that
I need some room to breathe while with you
All up, down and over me
You're not a name, you're just a face
It's contagious so catch it

This love is dirtier than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me
This'll sink lower than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

Dearest Enemy, you should listen to the streets
Because they tell you all you need to know
'Bout who and what you are
No smoke without a fire
With that I'll name drop you a liar
It suits your skin and bones
You've known all along
It's exactly what you are
It's contagious so catch it

This love is dirtier than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me
This'll sink lower than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

This is the first and the last time I swear
There's more where that came from
She said, do you know what that means?
'Cause I know what that means
This is the first and the last time I swear
It's a numbers game and you were there
Do you know what this means?
'Cause we know what this means

No (Oh!)
Who'd you think I was? Yeah
And oh (Oh!)
This leads to the only lead you were working on
And oh (Oh!)
And you were hopeless at best, yeah
And oh, forget the rest
Hotel rooms, cheap thrill dress
Lack of common sense
Could make this happen

If I could have a minute please
Then I'd bring you to your knees
This contagious, contagious chemistry

Dearest Enemy
You should have never trusted me
You bitch
