I've got a bad feeling,
That I went and got dirt on your name
And you swear you heard them say,
That is the guy who makes the biggest mistakes oh
He said, she said, that I'm a joke,
The kind of hoax that leaves a lump in your throat
From what I hear I still maintain some class
And if you let me be your first
I swear I'll be your last
And all the rumors that you may have heard
Have left a mark and striped you of your worth

And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know
And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know

You've got a gut feeling that
I went and got dirt on your name and
You swear you heard them say,
That giving up will be your biggest mistake
I've got a spot for blondes and green eyes
I am falling faster and it frames no surprise
Shallow is as shallow does
And if you let me have my way
I swear I'll tear you apart
All I've got is what I bare in these arms,
The saddest part is that is not enough

And everybody knows

And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know
And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know

And all I've got is what you don't
Wanna know where I will go
The saddest part is I am not with you

And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know
And I never meant to go
I'm leaving you the only way I know

You're a champ,
Itching for comeback,
But you're an inch, an inch away
You're a champ itching for a comeback so stay
