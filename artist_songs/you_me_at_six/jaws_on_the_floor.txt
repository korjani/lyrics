Let me suggest you do what you do,
And I will do what I do best.
You know I've always been resenting,
Resenting every word you've ever said.
I load my words with care
And aim them at the desperate.
Just to check they can still hear
As my innocence disappears

I must be blind.
To not have seen the signs.
Such a pretty little thing,
So much prettier without me

Life's a bitch, but I'm friends with her sister.
We talked it over and it's our little secret.
It's your world, I'm just trying to live in it.
When you're done maybe try a little listening

I smile at all my enemies.
I lead a life of positivity.
I deflect curses thrown my way.
I regret not saying...

I must be blind.
To not have seen the signs.
Such a pretty little thing,
So much prettier without me

Oh when you decide to cut the strings.
When you decide to ruin, my summertime...

We can be anything, we can be anything, we can be what you like.
We can be anything, we can be anything, we can be what you like.
Oh we can be what you like...

I must be blind.
To not have seen the signs.
Such a pretty little thing,
So much prettier without me

(I must be blind)
Oh when you decide to cut the strings.
When you decide to ruin, my summertime.
