I guess now is a good time to tell the truth
The pedigree I carry will swallow you.
But I am not what you are,
I'm flawless in every way.
Birds eye view,
I'm watching you.

Sad sad sight for the sore sore eyes and a headache for the weakest of minds.
You've got the boys, the boy's all tongue tied, but I know they're wasting their time.
Go
Go

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Oh just imagine what I thought when I opened up that door
It was a million things to one.
And oh, just imagine what they'll think
When they see me lead you north.
Hell, they'll be losing sleep.
And you're wrong
Wrong

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

It's so wrong
So wrong
It's so wrong

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Jealous minds they think alike
You're a damn damn tie,
you're wasting all my time.
You are in love.

Jealous minds they think alike
You're a damn damn tie,

You are in love.
