what are you so scared of?
Is it being alone when we no longer have the sun?
I don't need easy if you're there for me to lean on
I went looking with my eyes closed
Now I know I've found the one

Whoa, whoa
Can we learn to love again?
Can we learn to feel again?
Cause we're too young to feel this old
Yeah, we're too young to feel this old

Give up the ghost, it'll never be as good as that again
Like that time it left us both in stitches on our bed

Whoa, whoa
Can we learn to love again?
Can we learn to feel again?
Cause we're too young to feel this old
Yeah, we're too young to feel this old

"I'm just a boy," he said
"I'm just a girl," she said
"We're in love," they said
What happens next, who cares?

"And I'm just a boy," he said
"I'm just a girl," she said
"We're in love," they said
What happens next, who cares?

Can we learn to love again?
Can we learn to feel again?
Cause we're too young to feel this old
Yeah, we're too young to feel
We're too young to feel this old
