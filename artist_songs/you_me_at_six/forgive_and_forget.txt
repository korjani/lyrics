Let's forget what was said and give pain a rain check
Like before, when we stood tall over our callous sins.
See, all of your demons became my demons
On your front line I fought.
But we're oceans away, our glory days, went up, went up in flames.

And I, don't remember a thing.
And I, won't remember a thing.

We're getting close to an end now.
That was never in doubt
We used to talk for hours but you don't hear my voice now.

Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend.
Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend.

Ain't it a shame that, we let life change us.
We broke our promises.
Cut to the chase , don't keep me waiting
On why these good times fled.

And I, don't remember a thing.
And I, won't remember a thing.

We're getting close to an end now
That was never in doubt
We used to talk for hours
You don't hear my voice now

Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend.
Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend.
