I've been trying to make sense
I've been shouting under my breath
How's any of this in my interest?
When you sold me out, I must've not got the cheque
Your lust is a lie, but it comes as no surprise
Time after time, it goes right past the line
I do my best to, to make amends with you
But I just can't see the end oh

Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless, and you're defenseless

And isn't it funny how
Those black clouds follow you around?
It's Karma smiling down
Just let me know when it's in town
You act like the world owes you a favour
You want it all but you don't like the taste, oh
You've been throwing bricks at my window
Like there's no better way to say 'Hello'
Hello...

Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless, and you're defenseless

The best you never had [x4]

I'm the devil on your shoulder
I'm the conscious in your mind
I'm the feeling that you, you cannot hide
I'm the devil on your shoulder
Telling you that love is blind
It's OK when, it's hiding in disguise
Your loose lips let, let words slide
You spend too much time talking about my life
Stories you will spin just for a power trip
It's safe to say that I am not into it
In the picture you were not
Someone's in your spot
This is the result of people moving on
Good luck with killing time
You won't be killing mine
I'll do my best
To always be on your mind...
Your mind...

I never once said I didn't mean this
I can't wait to see how this one gets out
You are the first to question my achievements
But that's all right, my dreams I've been living

Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless, and you're defenseless

The best, you never had [x4]
