I hate to break it to you but
You're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
A level isn't good enough
You always do as you please so
I'm gonna follow suit and take a seat
And watch you fall apart (watch you fall apart)
'Cause in the end
What are you without me?

I'll slow this down 'cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh maybe I, maybe I was wrong from the start
I might be proud, but at least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
My gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asking how I was
Last I checked I was a fucking wreck
I called for help and no one showed up
So I sit in the dirt

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

[Oli Sykes:]
Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bear the sight of you anymore
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now that the wolves have closed the door
You wanna drag me down some more
Fuck you
Fuck you

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
