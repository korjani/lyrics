So this is the end of you and me
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
To do as you want, to do as you please
Without me

Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea?
Together we'd float so delicately
But that was back when we could talk about anything

'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed

Three whole words and eight letters late
And that would have worked on me yesterday
We're not the same, I wish that could change
But it can't

And I'll say your name and in the same breath
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
That we don't wanna believe

'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed

So it's true what they say
If you love someone, you should set them free
Oh, it's true what they say
When you throw it away

I don't know who you are
I don't know who you are

Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are
When you sleep with somebody else
'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're sleepin' with him

It's true what they say when you throw it away
