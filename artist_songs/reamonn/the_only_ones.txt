Sweet the hands that
Laid me to the ground
Sweet the voice that
Makes the sweetest sound

And I won't go down
I won't go down
On my knees
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

I've heard of love that
Inside she makes you strong
In your arms is where I
I Feel I belong

And it's only
If you want it
I'll be gone
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

It's a brand new day
We'll take it as it comes
There's nothing left to say
Cause it's all been said and done

And if the lights go out
We'll be the burning sun
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

There's just you and me
Hold on tight
We'll make it through the night
Just you and me
We are the only ones

And if the lights go out
We'll be the burning sun
And In the Darkest of nights
We'll be the only ones
And If we hold on tight
We'll make it through the night
There's just you and me
We are the only ones
And there's just you and me
We are the only ones
