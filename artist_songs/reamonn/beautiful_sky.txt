Oh tonight, shines down a guiding light
Showing a former life
When we felt so alive
In a sea of light swimming before my eyes
Hold on to what is right
Open your open mind
Oh no please don't let me go no please 
Don't leave me here to grieve innocent times
In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive 
Under beautiful skies
Oh tonight slip in and out of life
Yet feeling so alive
Lost in the sea of light
Oh no please don't let me go no please 
Don't leave me here to grieve innocent times
In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive 
Under beautiful skies
Oh no please don't let me go no please 
Don't let me go no please Beautiful Skies
In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive 
Under beautiful skies
