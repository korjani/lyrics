See the sun
Shine above your head
See the love
That you once had

Don't ever let go
Oh no
[x2]

See the dreams
That you hold inside
See the hope
See the colors fly

Don't ever let go
Oh no
[x2]

And if you wish upon it 
With open eyes
The world will sing to you
Yeah if you really want it
Then hold on tight
You've got everything to loose


See the world
Through a child's eyes
Never give up
Or let it slip by

Don't ever let go
Oh no
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go


When fortunes open wide
And if you wish upon it
You'll be surprised
How the world will sing to you

If you really want it
Then hold on tight
You've got everything to loose


Don't ever let go
You need to keep the dream alive
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go

Hold on tight
