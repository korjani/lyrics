Tell me if you got a problem 
Tell me if it's in your way 
Tell me if there's something bothering you 
Tell me what should I say 

You know I'd do almost anything 
You know I'd change the world 
You know I'd do almost anything 
for my little girl 

Tell me if you got a problem 
Tell me now what's inside 
Show me if you broke your heartstrings 
You know you never need to hide 

You know I'd do almost anything 
You know I'd paint the sky 
You know I'd do almost anything 
For you're my guiding light 

You are my star shining on me now, 
A love from world's apart 
I need for your 
You are my shining star

Once upon a time a memory 
Once upon a time girl 
Once upon a time perfect life 
Once upon a perfect world 

You know I'd do almost anything 
For you my guiding light 
You know I'd do almost everything 
To keep you in my life

You are my star shining on me now, 
A love from world's apart 
I need for your 
You are my shining star

Just a memory 
Every dream is of you and me 
If I wish upon a star 
Well I hope that's where you are 

When Heavens turn 
You know you'll shine 
You're in my heart for all time 
When Heaven turns 
You know you'll shine 
In worlds apart 

Cause yeah you are my Star 
A love from worlds apart I need for you, 
You are my shining star, my star 
A love from worlds apart I need for you, 
You are my shining star, 
shining on me now 
A love from worlds apart I need for you, 
You are my shining star, my star 
A love from worlds apart I need for you, 
You are my shining star 

You are my star shining on me now, 
A love from world's apart 
I need for your 
You are my shining star
