She never took the train alone
she hated being on her own 
She always took me by the hands
and said she needs me 
She never wanted in love to fail
she always hoped that it was real 
She'd look me in the eyes and say 'believe me' 
And then the night becomes the day
and there's nothing left to say 
If there's nothing left to say
then something's wrong

Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful 
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild

And as the hands would turn with time
she'd always say that she was my mine 
She'd turn and lend a smile
to say that she's gone 
But in a whisper she'd arrive
and danced into my life 
Like a music melody
like a lovers song

Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful 
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild

Through the darkest night
comes the brightest light
And the light that shines
is deep inside 
It's who you are

Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful 
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful …beautiful
Oh tonight you killed me with your smile
so beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild
So beautiful and wild
So beautiful and wild
