A child like screaming 
Get me out of here 
You're the chosen one 
And I believe 
I saw you sleeping under skies so clear 
You're the broken glass under my feet 
And I can see the light 
Tell me can you see the light 
Of these Open skies 
These open skies 
These open skies 
Wanna take me to you

Up here is freedom 
From a world so blind 
We're disappearing from who we are 
We found a reason 
To work it out 
We found a clearing 
Somewhere to start

Can you see the light 
Tell me can you see the light 
Of these Open skies 
These open skies 
These open skies 
These open skies 
Have come to save me

Don't panic now I can see the light 
Don't panic now I can see the light 
Don't panic now I can see the light 
We'll make it through these open skies
