Break up already, wake up now
Walk away, take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in His face with the rest of them

Break up already, wake up now
Walk away, take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in His face with the rest of them

Please, give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh please let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't bring anyone here

The chasm isn't fixed yet
Take this water
Drinking even deeper
Living water

The chasm isn't fixed yet
Take this water
Drinking even deeper
Living water

Please, give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh please let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't bring anyone here

Please, give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh please let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't you bring anyone here
