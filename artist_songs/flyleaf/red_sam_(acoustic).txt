Here I stand
Empty hands
Wishing my wrists were bleeding
To stop the pain from the beatings

And, there you stood
Holding me
Waiting for me to notice you

But who are you
You are the truth
I'm screaming these lies
You are the truth
Saving my life

The warmth of your embrace
Melts my frostbitten spirit
You speak the truth and I hear it
The words are I love you
And I have to believe in you

But who are you
You are the truth
I'm screaming these lies
You are the truth
Saving my life

My hands are open
And you are filling them
Hands in the air
In the air, in the air, in the air

And I worship
I worship
I worship
I worship

You are the truth
I'm screaming these lies
