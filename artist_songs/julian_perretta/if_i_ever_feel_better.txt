They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried, yet still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me, a thing I don't try to deny
But I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control
They say love ain't nothing but a sore, I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall, don't you know I'm so tired of it all ?
I have known terror dizzy spells, finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is, it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever, to be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire, now I know that a breeze can blow away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, baby...
If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number, when it's all over, I'll let you know
Hang on to the good days, I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
And I'm feeding the enemy, I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try I can't try...
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came, I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost, know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall, they were made of dust, after all
Someday, all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, cause...
If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number, when it's all over, I'll let you know
If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number, when it's all over, I'll let you know
It's like somebody took my place, I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed, well, I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me, a thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that'll go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through, I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried, yet still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, baby...
If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number, when it's all over, I'll let you know
If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number, when it's all over, I'll let you know
If I ever feel better, if I ever feel better
If I ever feel better, if I ever feel better
