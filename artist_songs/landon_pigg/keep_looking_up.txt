Like a little locket hangs 
Round your little neck so closely to your heart 
So shall I be forever 
I know you're going somewhere new 
And I know it's never gonna to feel like home to you 
But this time the only way around is through 

So keep looking up, on past the birds 
And keep looking up past the clouds 
And when you reach up and clear away the stars 
I will be there where you are 

Like a little locket hangs 
Round your little neck so closely to your heart 
So shall I be forever 
And even if you run away 
Put on all your dark clothes, hide in shadows 
Just remember one thing 

Keep looking up, on past the birds 
And keep looking up past the clouds 
And when you reach up and clear away the stars 
I will be there where you are 

I will be there where you are 
I will be there? 

Keep looking up, on past the birds 
And keep looking up past the clouds 
And when you reach up and clear away the stars 
I will be there where you are 

Keep looking up, on past the birds 
And keep looking up past the clouds 
And when you reach up and clear away the stars 
I will be there where you are 

So closely to your heart?
