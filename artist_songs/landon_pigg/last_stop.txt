I write a million songs about the weather 
But when it comes to you 
I pick up all the pieces of the chords I didn't use. 

I pick them up and glue them back together 
I sure hope this will do 
Here's piece of trash I cleaned and polished just for you. 

Cause it's the last stop of the night 
I sure hope this will do 
Yeah, I sure hope it will do 
It's the last kiss of the night 
I sure hope it'll do 
Cause after this I'm through 

This distance is the best thing that could happen 
When it comes to us 
I was getting tired of pretending it was love 

One girl's trash is some other boy's treasure 
When it comes to skin 
Against a tiny shirt, you know the boys don't often win 

Cause it's the last stop of the night 
I sure hope this will do 
Yeah, I sure hope it will do 
It's the last kiss of the night 
I sure hope it'll do 
Cause after this I'm through 

With you 

Can't you see I'm killing you 
Can't you see I'm dead 
Goodbye love, goodnight hate, just let me go to bed. 

It's the last stop of the night 
I sure hope this will do 
Yeah, I sure hope it will do 
It's the last pointless kiss of my life 
I sure hope it'll do 
Cause after this I'm through 

With you...with you... 

I'm through
