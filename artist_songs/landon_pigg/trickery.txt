They say your life is like a yellow brick road-
That's nice, mine's like a maze.
Is there some secret handshake that I do not know?
'Cause I stop and ask for help and people tell me different ways.

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong to me.
Well it's like a game, they're winning best of three.

'Cause trickery's always triggering sirens in my head,
In my head.
And trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head,
Cloud my head.

I'm like a homeless man caught in a storm,
With no point to run for cover,
As I stand motionless under the gray,
This H2O invisible army infiltrates my brain.

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong to me.
Well they're coming fast, they're only pickin' up speed.

'Cause trickery's always triggering sirens in my head,
In my head.
And trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head,
Cloud my head.

I wish I could discern the things I cannot see,
Or am I too concerned with finding clarity?
All these questions are killing me,
And everyone tells me different things.

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong.
They're coming fast, they'll be here before too long.

Trickery's always triggering sirens in my head,
In my head.
Yeah, trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head,
Cloud my head.

Trickery's always triggering sirens, and
Trickery's trying to cover my eyes, yeah
Trickery's always messin' with my head.
