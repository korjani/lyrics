Dodging dried vomit on the sidewalk as I walk 
I'm singing some stupid song I heard on the radio 
Strolling down the most important street in Nashville 

Holding in my left hand the weak man's hammer 
I always keep an extra set of nails in case I break one 
But nothing ever seems to get broken in my world 

That's just the problem with me these days 
I'm walking on eggshells 
Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever goes right 
I don't know how to get help 
I'm walking on eggshells 

And I can't feel a thing 
And nothing ever happens to me 

Nothing in this world it seems can sweep me off my feet 
Everything's amazing, but only in theory 
Someone help me cause I'm losing it quietly 

That's just the problem with me these days 
I'm walking on eggshells 
Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever goes right 
I don't know how to get help 
And everything is perfect 
But nothing ever moves me 
Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever goes right 
Give me feathers or give me nails 
I'm walking on eggshells 

You might be the one for me but I will never know 
I can't fall in love if I've fallen asleep 
Will I ever wake up? 
I'm walking on eggshells 

Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever goes right 
I don't know how to get help 
And everything is perfect 
But nothing ever moves me 
Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever goes right 
Give me feathers or give me nails 
I'm walking on eggshells 

Give me feathers or give me nails 
I'm walking on eggshells 

Everything is perfect 
I can't feel a thing 
Everything is perfect
