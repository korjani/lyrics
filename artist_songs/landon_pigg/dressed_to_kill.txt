Are you wondering 
wondering if I like you? 
Or are you wondering 
If I care at all 
Cause all that you're getting 
all that you're getting is glances 
and if you're lucky, a stare 

I know I feed your desires 
to wear red lipstick and be dressed for the kill 
Yeah, I know I feed your desires 
Cause now you're murdering my soul 

So you take off your glasses. 
And highlight your lashes 
and it's the beginning of a sad song 
You lower your collar 
I start to notice 
and it's the beginning of a sad sad song 

Well, I know I feed your desires 
to wear red lipstick and be dressed for the kill. 
Yeah, I know I feed your desires 
Cause now you're murdering my soul 

What have I created? 
A criminal with good intentions 
And all that you wanted was love. 
But I didn't notice 
and look where that got us 
Well, I've become shallow and still you have no trace of the very thing that you wanted 

I know I feed your desires 
to wear red lipstick and be dressed for the kill 
Yeah, I know I feed your desires 
Cause now you're murdering my soul 

I know I feed your desires 
to wear red lipstick and be dressed for the kill. 
I'm sorry I fed those desires 
because I've been murdering your soul
