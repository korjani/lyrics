Please don't do what I say 
Cause if you don't love me, it's worthless anyway 
Please don't trouble yourself 
You'll only go away in the end 

Please don't follow all my commands 
Cause what's the point in that 
I keep hoping that all of your plans 
Will fall through the roof 

[Chorus:]
Like two ships passing in the night were gone 
Only the moon and the stars in the sky did know 
To cry for me 
As I sailed on 

Please don't trouble yourself 
I only want your love 
You keep giving me your help 
Oh please stop playing along 
You know you're wasting your energy 
And you're breaking my heart 

[Chorus]

Oh I can just see it now (I can see it now) 
You're recklessly in love 
Your heart's boiling over 
Oh I can just see it now 
You're coming around 

[Chorus]
