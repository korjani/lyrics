It's not my desire; it's not my choice 
It's not intentional; I'm hypnotised by your voice 
The same old thing, but always new 
It's unbelievable how strongly I feel for...toward you 

It's more like magnetism than anything else 
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will 
It was not my decision, if you couldn't tell 
It's more like magnetism; I can't even control myself 

Cannot keep away; I feel the tension grow 
It's getting stronger now, it's getting stronger now 
It's getting stronger now, you're all I see 
You have so much power over me 

It's more like magnetism than anything else 
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will 
It was not my decision, if you couldn't tell 
It's more like magnetism; I can't even control myself 

It's more like magnetism between you and me 
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will 
My appetite to coincide with you grows stronger every night 
And I can't fight magnetism, you know I can't even control myself, oh, myself
