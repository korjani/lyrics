It's not that you lost a friend 
I just need some time to lick my wounds 
I'll be out of service for a little while 
I'm sure I'll be up and running soon 

He's just an amateur these days 
Not used to dealing with this pain 
He's just an amateur these days 
Never thought that he'd see it go away 

And our history will never be erased 
You were a great companion 
And some memories will never ever fade 
So I love, and so I hate 

What we were I never knew, nor did you 
And that's exactly what you hated 
For three years you were confused 
And for three years, my intentions left unstated 

And our history can never be erased 
You were a great companion 
And some memories will never ever fade 
So I love and so I hate 

So this is the end
Of an innocent era, an innocent era 
I didn't want you but I did
it's never wrong
but then it is 

And our history can never be erased 
You were a great companion 
And some memories will never fade away 
You were a great companion 

And our history can never be erased 
You were a great companion 
And some memories will never ever ever fade
