I don't why I do what I 
I don't why I do what I do 
It feels so good to me 
I guess that's why I do what I 
I guess that's why I do what I do 
'Cause it feels good to me and it's right there for the taking 

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die, 
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's true 
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?" 
The tin man's got nothing on me 
Heart, I hope you wake up soon 

I don't know why I feel like I should change 
I don't know why what I need and what I want can't be the same thing, oh 
I don't know why I don't miss my friends 
I don't know why I cannot comprehend how special love can be 
And it's right there for the taking 

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die 
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's good 
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?" 
The tin man's got nothing on me 
Heart, I hope you wake up soon 
The tin man's got nothing on me 

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die 
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's good 
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?" 
The tin man's got nothing on me 
Heart, I hope you wake up soon, please
