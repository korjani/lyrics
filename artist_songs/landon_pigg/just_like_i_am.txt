Her beauty is blinding but she means nothing wrong 
She's looking for love just like I am 
Amazing in the sunlight, a gift for a man 
She's looking for love just like I am 

Just like I am, like I am, 
just like I am, I am.
Hey, hey 
All the best intentions are no match for your skin 
Hey, hey 
Well how am I supposed to love you if I don't even know you?

She walks in the shadow of a beauty so bright 
But she's looking for love just like I am 
An obvious blessing but a curse in disguise when you're looking for love 

Just like I am, like I am 
just like I am, I am 
Hey, hey 
All my best intentions are no match for your skin 
Hey, hey 
You know I thought I knew what love was, but sometimes I get confused 
Sometimes I get confused yeah, sometimes I get confused yeah.

Hey, hey 
All my best intentions are no match for your skin 
Hey hey 
And how am I supposed to know you if I can't even love you? 

Hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey
