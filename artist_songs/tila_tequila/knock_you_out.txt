Everytime I'm at the club or the bar.
Girls be acting like they retards.
Mad cause they man straight up rock hard;
And he ain't even on my radar.
Tila Tequila, rockstar. Doing it and gettin head in my car.
The baddest bitch from Queens to Crenshaw;
When you stuffin your bra.
Don't need a crew everytime I smash out.
Look me up and down and I'll pull your tracks out.
Talk some shit; I'll lay ya ass out,
I'm from H-Town, bitch, you know what we about.

I put down for my city And I get-get-gridy
Yeah muthafucker That's what's up
And just because your girl pretty
With some big ass titties
Don't mean I won't fuck you up
I bet you won't be lookin' so HOT
When I knock you out and make you say WHAT? !
(Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh my God!)

Some of these bitches be industry,

I'm in my twenties, you 43.
Now she's trying to be just like me.
I don't wanna fuck your man, hell nah, I
Just wanna hit the club with the fam & get low.
I make your nose bleed like too much blow,
Then I jump on stage and make 'em say OHHHH
Now I'm gonna do what it do, but some of these dudes is bitches too.
Suckas buying cars sprung on the coo-chie, yeah that's me. Tila Tequila.

It's RJ bras and rockin' Marc Jacobs
All day flossin', fuckin' ya'll face up
You try to photoshop your face up
Ever since you put your myspace up
I break rules, my shit's forbidden
You look like a dude, this bitch is straight trippin'
A-list celeb? Who are you kiddin'?
Everything you tryna do, I done did it
You could never run the game cause I'm in it
This your last five seconds of your fifteen minutes
I put down for my city And I get-get-gridy
Yeah muthafucker That's what's up
And just because your girl pretty
With some big ass titties
Don't mean I won't fuck you up
I bet you won't be lookin' so HOT
When I knock you out and make you say WHAT? !
(Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh my God!)
