Can’t you see that the curtain has fallen between us?
And that the statues of leavers keep smashing on the burning foy
A sense that is growing behind, the martyr’s dying peek
Our live has no meaning, the world forgot about me

We’re dying, we’ve fallen, we’re calmly disappearing
We’re trying, defining, our sense of right and wrong
It’s a dying breed, it’s a thing from the past
We’re a dying breed

Can’t you see that the magic is over, I see it ever started
And how the music we listen keeps fading, she’s lost control
The new tribes they gather around the Earth’s dying core
The new waves are waving, no place for me anymore

We’re dying, we’ve fallen, we’re calmly disappearing
We’re trying, defining, our sense of right and wrong
It’s a dying breed, it’s a thing from the past
We’re a dying breed

We’re dying, we’ve fallen, we’re calmly disappearing
We’re trying, defining, our sense of right and wrong
We’re dying, escaping, still falling, disappearing
We’re trying, defining, our place in the natural order
As a dying breed, just a dying breed
We’re a dying breed, we’re a thing from the past
We’re a dying breed, just a dying breed
Just a dying breed!
