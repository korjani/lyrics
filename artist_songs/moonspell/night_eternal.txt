Come morning, chalice of dawn
To crown the Sufferer in their glory
Come for we are failing
Come for we are waiting
For we are trying to breathe

First in the skies, apocalypse
Only your fury can set us free
Come for we are failing
Come for we are waiting
For we are trying to breed

Night eternal, our world is burning
Bride eternal, our world is dying

Come forth, for we are blood
And to blood we shall return

"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus"

Night eternal, our world is burning
Bride eternal, our world is dying
