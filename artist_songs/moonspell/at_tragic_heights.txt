"And the first went, and poured upon the earth; and there fell...
A grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast..."

"And the second angel poured out the vial upon the sea;
And it became as the blood of a dead man;
And every living soul died in the sea."

"And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun;
And power was given unto him to scorch men with fire."

"And the seventh angel pured out his vial into the air;
And there came a great voice
Out the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying: It is done."
[Book Of Revelation #16, John]

At tragic heights
A failure pure
Surrender to nothing
But the truth
Fall now - endlessly
Into the ashes
And dare to know

At tragic heights
She hangs from the sky
A requiem played
In a broken heart

At tragic days
The height of truth
Trust no one but your own blood
Shade now - eternally into the hearts
And dare to be cruel

At tragic heights
She hangs from the sky
A requiem played
In a broken heart

At stars unborn
All has begun
At the shadow sun
Delirium

At tragic heights
She hangs from the sky
A requiem played
In a broken heart
In a rotten heart
