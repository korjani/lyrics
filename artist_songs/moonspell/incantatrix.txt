Seasons came and seasons went
Rocked to sleep through the sounds of hate
Your prince was born without a face
Something too bright, fades away
I've lost your trace

Seasons came and seasons went
Marched to battle in thy name
Your throne is now an empty place
We fill your heart with naked flames

When you're afraid, just call my name
I'll keep you safe until it's day again

Can you feel the heartbeat, through the sea and the mist
In the wake of the witch, through the shadows and hate
I've lost your grace, I've lost your trace

People die and times they end
Watch you past far away
The throne sits now in empty lands
We crushed your heart with naked hands
