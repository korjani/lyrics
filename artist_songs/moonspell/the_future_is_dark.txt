Oh, my son too young to understand that life is dark sometimes
There is just not enough light
And you, you broke me everyday, but I fought you back
I think I could die in the next room without you noticing

Where do we go, where do we go from here and where do we go?
Where do we go, where do we go from here, what happened to us?

Gotta breathe in, gotta breathe out
Up on your feet, gotta think twice
The future is dark, the future is vile
Without you there's no tomorrow

We, we die alone, but we live without
And yes, it hurts me so to realize that death won't do us
Won't do us part, but something
Something else might

Where do we go, where do we go from here and where do we go?
Where do we go, where do we go from here, what happened to us?

Gotta breathe in, gotta breathe out
Up on your feet, gotta think twice
The future is dark, the future is vile
Without you there's no tomorrow
Gotta breathe in, gotta breathe out
Up on your feet, gotta think twice
The future is dark, it’s all that we’ve got
Without you there's no tomorrow
