Tomorrow, will you wake up? 
And instead of eyes we will be born with blindfolds.
And tomorrow, will I wake up?
And from my mouth will flee a song.

Tomorrow I will wake up,
With this strange need of not to belong.
Tomorrow I will wake up,
Just to copy whatever is wrong.

Tomorrow I will wake up,
In a cage of perfect gold.
And tomorrow, will I wake up?
Hope in tongue, golden song.

Tomorrow I will wake up.
With an innate appetite,
To be one of yours.
To be just one of yours.

Tomorrow I will wake up,
And try everything not to be alone.
And tomorrow will I wake up?
And try everything to be alone.

Incise, open wide from the inside.
Cast out, see what is still left of life.
Secure for me the status of a prime suspect.
Tying the hands of a blindman,
Teaching the colours to a blindman.
Tying the hands of a blindman,
Teaching the colours to a blindman.

And ask him to react, and ask him to react.

Tomorrow.
Tomorrow I will finally feel,
A natural will.
Tomorrow I will finally feel,
A natural will, of being artificial, of being artificial.

IN-TO dekadance, IN-TO with elegance.
