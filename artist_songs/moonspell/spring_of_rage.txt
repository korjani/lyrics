In our every moment
With our every breath
Even far away
Your eyes are ways
Disputing my darkness

In your darkest hour
With the dying sun
Preying all alone
Your lips the downfall
Colouring my days

As if in a spring of rage
Your fury and beauty would incarnate

In your every moment
Lays a cruel fate
Even from a distance
Your hands of doom
Disquieting my darkness

As if in a spring of rage
Your fury and beauty would incarnate

Release my pain

Widowed in the whiteness pure
Clouded captive by the moon

As if in a spring of rage
Your fury and beauty would incarnate
