Medusa caught in the mirror blade
Expression burnt in the waters red
Under her wing born all the same
No dreams of rising for the kind of man
Moon in Mercury
Queen of the deeps in dust portrayed
The broken heart never hesitate
Gone down the tree to draw the first blood

A revelation with every cut:
Infidel to all creeds
Breaker of all vows
Enemy of happy ends
Confident of the dead

Moon in Mercury
This is my body exhausted in a ring of fire
When you take it your eyes will be opened
Moon in Mercury

This is my flesh consumed by the ring of fire
When you taste it your eyes will be opened
Moon in Mercury
Red in the waters
Black in the mirrors
