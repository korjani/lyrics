White skies roar with battle cries
Haters meet, lovers die

And I wait for your touch now
My flesh in yours, and yours in mine
Once again I am raising my blade
This time we face each other

By these hands - untouched
By these lips - unspoken
Every heart - a jewel
Every heart - a stronghold

Skies come down!
White skies roar with battle cries
Haters meet, lovers die

And I wait for your love now
We came so close, too close to turn back
Once again, I have your life in my hands
It's brothers against brothers

By these hands - untouched
By these lips - unspoken
Every heart - a jewel
Every heart - a stronghold

Skies come down!
White skies roar with battle cries
Haters meet, lovers die
