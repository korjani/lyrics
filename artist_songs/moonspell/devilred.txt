She wears devil red

She sweats the poison
All over her
Keeps me quiet
Inside her storm
She has the method
No other knows

Red as the veins
She likes to swim in
Floating so gently
Through this human misery

She must be a part
Of a higher plan
Something I can't understand

She wears devil red

She's selling a damned soul
To whoever pays the most
Her body - the cure 
For all evil and good

Red as the veins 
She likes to swim in 
Floating so gently
Through this human misery

She must be a part
Of the higher plan
Something I can't understand

She wears devil red

Devil red
