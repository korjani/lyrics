Through the light and the thunder 
When it's night and day
Darkness take my hand now 
Take me anywhere

I could take shelter 
I could pretend 
I could run against it
Wouldn't stop
Wouldn't stop the wind

Oh it's time!
To pick up a rose
From the mouth of the dragon
Oh it's time!
To bring you down from your tower
Start a chain reaction

Oh it's time!
Time to lay her down
Ashes to ashes
Oh it's time! Oh it's time!
Time to cover the world in Funeral Bloom

Through the age of light
Aquarius
When it's night and day
Follow the blind man
Through the fire
They always know their way

I could take cover
No use for protection!
I could smash your other cheek
Blood out in the wind

Oh it's time!
Time to lay her down
Ashes to ashes
Oh it's time! Oh it's time!
Time to cover the world in Funeral Bloom

Oh it's time!
Time to lay her down
Ashes to ashes
Now it's time! Yeah it's time!
No other colors but Funeral Bloom

We rise, we fall
Without control
We crash and burn
So damn our souls
I show you no remorse
ERGO SUM PECCATORE

For he was a good man
A supplicant
(And) disaster was his god
Now devoid of earthly lust
I command him to the skies
Where everyone is just
And everything will be fine
Where everyone is just
And everything will be fine

Now it's time!
Time to lay her down
Ashes to ashes
Oh it's time! 
Time to cover the world in Funeral Bloom

Oh it's time! Oh it's time!
Time to lay her down
Ashes to ashes
Now it's time! Yeah it's time!
No choice of color but Funeral Bloom

We rise, we fall
Without control
We crash and burn
So damn our souls
I show you no remorse
I'm but a sinner, a liar
A man who lost his course
ERGO SUM PECCATORE
