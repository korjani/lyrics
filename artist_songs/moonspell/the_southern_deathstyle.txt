The silver bullet - so earthly fast
Forever rope - so hard to find
The silver bullet - so earthly thrashed
Forever rope - symbol of Trust

The mandrake's root your restless lover
The morning blade, first to awake
The morning shame that you can't take
The mandrake's root. In Venenum veritas...

The silver bullet. The Southern Deathstyle
Forever Rope - forever tied
The mandrake's pill - your magic route to nowhere
The morning breaks - it's lunar still...

The elements all moulded together
A family whose name is Death
The elements in circle fear
Bullet. Root. Blade. and Rope
All hold so dear
