Somewhere inside a soul
A shadow is taking over
My questions are being answered
An act of courage
My story is being told
Somewhere inside these four walls
Another war has begun

The prodigal son came home tonight
To slay his father
And drink his blood

Noite eterna
Primeira vida
Ainda por revelar
Noite eterna
Primeira sombra
Ainda por revelar

With the violence of a first light

Somewhere in a rose of death
A leader is being followed
His cities are catching fire
But he doesn't hear
His people screaming

Somewhere as the morning breaks
Steps are heard in the shattering glass
The bride to be returned to the feast
To make love end

Noite eterna
Primeira vida
Ainda por revelar
Noite eterna
Primeira sombra
Ainda por revelar

With the violence of a first light

Hordes of the shadow sun
Afire with the intuition
We are a race of sorrows beholding
The tear and the wear of the earth

FIRST LIGHT, CURSED BE!
