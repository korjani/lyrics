When the routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And the resentment rides high
But emotions wont grow
And were changing our ways,
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold
Turned away on your side? 
Is my timing that flawed,
Our respect run so dry? 
Yet theres still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings expose? 
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just cant function no more? 
When love, love will tear us apart again
