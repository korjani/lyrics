Hate is the place where a man finally is
That flame that feels us colder
Hate is the place where a man finally wins
The character in the stronger
An ambition never seen
I refuse to turn my face away
Never waited on you brothers of blood
Your tomorrow was yesterday

Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
Disaster struck higher than others
Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
A destiny like no other

Hate is a palace that a man finally enters
To claim the freedom to escape
Hate is what grows in disturb between us
Tenderness, heartache and shame
In the challenge of our dreams
Memory will bring us together
Screaming in the heart of the insane
For tomorrow was yesterday

Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
Disaster struck higher than others
Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
A destiny like no other

(Men So Violently Ashamed)

A creation like no other
Refused upon the blood of me
Never wait, for everything is vain
And tomorrow was yesterday

Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
Disaster struck higher than others
Greater lessons learned
Upon the blood of men
A destiny like no other
A tragedy like no other
