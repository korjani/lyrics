Diurnal shall be your redemption.
The last of spirits now leaves your body.
We all act as if You are not there.
Seeing is not believing

Possessional, your communication.
What gets inside us the moment we are born?
What was that descending?
From lowering skies

I am no One
The center of Universe
What got inside you?
The moment you were born.
Could you see Him descending,
Descending Supreme
From lowering skies.
