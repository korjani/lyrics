Never resist
The firewalker
He has been sent
To educate you
never look back
at the great Deep
and never dance to
that curse he sings

Never resist
The life long Pessimist
he is the leader
and not the enemy
My heart complete
put to destroy you
my darkness is obsolete
please let me follow you

And when we meet there
Into the heartshaped abyss
you'll scar my your kiss
and when we meet there
into the heartshaped abyss
you'll forgive me everything
scared away
get away

Never resist the firewalker
he has been sent to lay a curse on you
never look back, never resist
Liar I am ready to push you

And when we meet there
Into the heartshaped abyss
you'll scar my your kiss
and when we meet there
into the heartshaped abyss
you'll forgive me everything
scared away
get away

Let's get away from this world
to a place we are still beautiful

Abismo portátil, em forma de coração
