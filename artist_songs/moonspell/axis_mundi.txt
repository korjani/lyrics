Ipso Facto, Axis Mundi!

Sandtime bled, die for the truth
Drop of plague in the vein of the crowd
One will be enough to suffocate
The misery this world has turned into

Ergo a cabeça sim mas apenas para sentir
a lâmina fria que me beija a nuca
[English translation:]
Yes I raise my head but only to feel
the cold blade that kisses my nape

Ipso Facto, Axis Mundi!

Poison dart shot in the poor
Seed of hope spilled by the sick
Another lie will be enough to illuminate
The misery the race has turned into

Ergo a cabeça sim mas apenas para sentir
a lâmina fria que me beija a nuca

Ipso Facto, Axis Mundi!
Equinox in every word
Falling leaves in every soul
In every word in every soul
We're lost in a dying world
