When I move
You move with me
I feed off you
You feast on me

And what I see
You can not see
That when I move
You move with me

Where's this small
dead hand that creeps me
I am biting it to its very bone
Collapsing with everything new on me
until it gets so very old

And what I see
You can not see
That when I move
You move with me

There is this third body
spinning fast
reducing me
into a relapse
with its crippled flaps
slow motion dims
sweetly parasited
by butterfly wings

And what I see
You can not see
That when I move
You move with me

All that is old is new again
(To be) each other spies
we're condemned
Everything is everywhere
The butterfly effect

And what I see
You can not see
I will have to kill you
Before you kill me

Everything is everywhere
The butterfly effect
