[Spoken:]
"Dorme, dorme meu menino!
Dorme - no mar dos sargaços;
Que mais vale o mar a pino
Que as Serpentes nos meus braços!"
[Mário Cesáriny]

And when all Life as you know it - fails
All ghostlike lips taste just the - same
What better comfort can you find
Than the Serpents in my Arms

Sleep, sleep - now, my Child
In the Sea of crystal Trouble
For better is the violent Sight
than all that you leave behind

In your Eyes - a Dark so subtile
It tells you walk, but never fly
To leave us all behind

And when all Life as you know it - fails
All ghostlike Lips taste just the - same
What better comfort can you find
Than the Serpents in my Arms

Down, down - terrible Child
To look at It, it is a Sin
For better is to hold that Smile
That's all you leave behind

In your Eyes - a Mark so subtile
It tells you walk, but never fly
Never fly - to leave us all 
To leave us all behind

And when all Life as you know it - fails
All ghostlike Lips taste just the......same
What better comfort can you find
Than the Serpents in my Arms

What better comfort can you find
Than
The Serpents 
In my Arms
