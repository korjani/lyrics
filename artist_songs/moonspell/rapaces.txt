Eternal life runs so slow
While you play your lamentation show
Eternal kisses are cold
Why do you think they are beautiful?
Let the candles burn,
And the stakes go through the soul.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!

Eternal life runs so very slow,
Impossible, so very wrong.
Final prayers are loud,
How do you think that yours will sound?
Not all romantic wounds,
Most of us are strong.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!

Eternal life runs so very slow,
You are the star of my lamentation show.
Eternal kisses are gold,
Yes I think they're beautiful.
Let all candles burn,
None of us are strong.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!
