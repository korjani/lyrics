Our seals were so easily broken
Our hopes were so silently crushed
Still our hearts can't be broken
Still our hearts will hold

'Cause once we were kings
Made friends with the beast
And thus we shall fall
And thus we shall see
What the future brings
New tears eve

Green light, deep inside the night
Tonight we're hateful

Our words take the shape of our secrets
Silent vows, violently crushed
Still our minds to be open, still our heads hang low

'Cause once we were kings
Made friends with the beast
And thus we shall fall
And thus we shall see
What the future brings
New tears eve

Green light, deep inside the night
Tonight we're hateful
