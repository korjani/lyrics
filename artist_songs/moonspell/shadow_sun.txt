In your soul time
When you're closing down
Shadow sun
Of the white sleep
Of death
I am standing still
In the blackest rain
Denying you
Breaking day

In the name of nothing
When we break apart
I will raise the dead
The chain of lies
I am freezing over
Crystal mountain clay
Cloud of darkness
Defeating pain

And then you fell
Becoming darkness
Shadow sun

Life is meaningless
