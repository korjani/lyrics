And then the wine as if his blood
And then the cracks as if was cruelty
By her lips his words are swallowed
Her tongue a blizzard
No reflection in the mirror, no resistance!

The skin gave the lamb away
The stars are hiding in the shade
Sweat running down the riverbed
Tonight I sleep in the chamber of the queen

And then the blood as if was wine
Your sacred lips will never dry now that you're mine
Your father's apple stuck in my throat
No reflection in the mirror, no salvation!

The skin gave the lamb away
The stars are hiding in the shade
Sweat running down the riverbed
Tonight I sleep in the chamber of the queen
