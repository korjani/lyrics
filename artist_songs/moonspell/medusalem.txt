Two white feathers sewn on the angel black
Be mine just for another thousand nights
Or leave me to rot to the gods of the sun
Just for a thousand lives
Two white feathers sewn to the the angel's back

In Medusalem

Drive a needle through the camel's eye
The heart is a ticking time bomb
Ready to explode
Or leave me to smoke with the assassins tonight
Together we ride
Two white feathers sewn to the the angel's back

To Medusalem

It's the land of honey
The land of pain
The city falls under its weight
The golden sands were painted red
And we shall free you from your chains

Two white feathers sewn on the angel black
Just open the gates, let there be light!
Or leave me to be with Morgana tonight
To the land of Cain, come together, we'll ride
Two more feathers sewn to the the angel's back

To Medusalem

It's the land of honey
The land of pain
The city falls under its weight
The golden sands were painted red
And we shall free you from your chains

To Medusalem

It's the land of honey
The land of pain
The city falls under its weight
The golden sands were painted red
And we shall free you

It's the land of honey, the land of pain
The city walls give in to faith
The golden sands were painted red
And we shall free you from your chains
