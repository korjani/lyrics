The Majestic horns of Baphometare indeed our occult banners proudly up in the air!

The androgynous light of Lucipheris our noble passion, most dear and rare!
Oh! Faustian spirit of conquest
May be thy allied in this infimious battle
Against the Arauts of Desrespect
Those who step with muddy feet the sapient inscriptions of our cradle.
To our strengthening I proudly confess:
I worship thee, for they are my weapons to hurt god.
Oh! Great wings of Beelzebuth
Will you honour me and lay the head of a son of caym, in the soft sands of Manitou
Where I'll sleep under this neophyth
Sky of Anxiety.

For the dawn of Knowledge has a Southern Sign
Delfos will once again desveil its light
And those with eyes will drink this precious wine
But for the blind, Ignorance shall be the only sight!

To our strengthening I will re-affirm:
I worship thee.

They are my Shield.

And their message I shall reveal.
Because: "Quod sciptum, Scripsi!"
And this Southern blend of esoteric sapience
This sensual Mediterranic Philosophy
Will be the only and holy science
And these lines both dream and prophecy!
"Ecce Homo!" - Those you'll call the Wise
Who will destroy this pitiful hole of common sense of disrespect for the true occult devise
Those who from, the lambs, shall feel the sharpened spears of Intelligence!

I worship thee. "Quod sciptum, Scripsi!"
I worship thee. "Consummatum est!"
