I'll see you in my dreams, 
Hold you in my dreams. 
Someone took you out of my arms, 
Still I feel the thrill of your charms. 

Lips that once were mine,
Tender eyes that shine, 
They will light my way tonight, 
I'll see you in my dreams.

Now!

I'll see you in my dreams, 
Hold you in my dreams. 
Someone took you out of my arms, 
Still I feel the thrill of your charms. 

Lips that once were mine,
Tender eyes that shine, 
They will light my way tonight, 
I'll see you in my dreams.

Now!

I'll see you in my dreams,
I'll see you in my dreams.
