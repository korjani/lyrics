Breathe in,
Breathe out,
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of day

Every man's a sinner
Every man's a liar
Life's a slow procession into the fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

Every man's a sinner in the name of the father
History's repeating into the fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

We started wanting to be ourselves until we are no more

Breathe in,
Breathe out,
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of day

Every man is a leader
Every man is a martyr
Every man is in trouble caught in your fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

We started wanting to be ourselves, to live our lives
We went too far perhaps beyond control until we are no more

[3x]
Breathe in,
Breathe out,
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of day
