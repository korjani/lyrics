From now on, no more philandering,
No more hot spots, no scatterbrain.
From now on, my fun will be meandering
With my darling down Lovers' Lane.

The old gang will never know me
When they find
I've become the kind
People call "homing".
No more yearn for something new, dear,
All I need is you, dear, from now on.

From now on, no more philandering,
No more hot spots, no scatterbrain.
No more yearn for something new, dear,
All I need is you, dear, from now on.
