If I should lose you, the stars would fall from the sky 
If I should lose you, leaves would wither and die 
The birds in May-time, they'd sing a mournful refrain 
And I would wander around, hating the sound of rain 

With you beside me, the rose would bloom in the snow 
With you beside me, no winds of winter would blow 
I gave you my love, and I was living a dream 
But living would seem, in vain
If I 
(Hating the rain, if I) 
(All is in vain if I) 
If I ever lost you
