Yes, it's a good day for singing a song,
and it's a good day for moving along;  
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything be wrong,
A good day from morning' till night

Yes, it's a good day for shining your shoes,
and it's a good day for losing the blues;
Everything to gain and nothing' to lose, 
A good day from morning' till night

I said to the Sun, "Good morning sun
Rise and shine today"
You know you've gotta get going
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you you've got the right of way.

'Cause it's a good day for paying your bills;
And it's a good day for curing your ills,
So take a deep breath and throw away the pills;
'Cause it's a good day from morning' till night.
