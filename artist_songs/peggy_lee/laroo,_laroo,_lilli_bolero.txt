Laroo laroo lilli bolero,
That's a magic sayin'
That I heard one day in Napoli;
When a fortune teller
In a dim lit cellar said to me,
"You say laroo lilli bolero;
And just like that quick as an arrow
You'll find the boy who's meant for you."
And sure enough it all came true,
Laroo laroo lilli bolero
