Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be
(Want to be)
Close to you.
You make me feel so alive!
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural natural woman
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural natural woman
