Beyond the shadow of a dove
As the mighty river flows
As the meadow gaily plays
With the wind of summer days
'Bout as deep as we can go
From the canyon to the skies
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bears

Do I love you
Don't you know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love
Must I always say
Do I love
Yes in every way

About as sacred as a hymn
And a bible full of prayers
From a whisper to a roar
Very much and even more
And I shall show it with my eyes
And share it with the night
If in death the good Lord is kind
You'll be the last thing on my mind

Do I love you
Don't you know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love
Do I have to say
Do I love
Yes in every way

Do I love you
You should know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love
Do I have to say
Do I love
Yes in every way
