Tonight is my night out for dancing
There's a guy that I'm romancing
I hope he falls for me before the night is through
I can't wait till we start swaying
What the heck is that they're playing
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do

You better play a rumba for me
'Cause I know he will adore me
When I begin to do a rumba shake or two
I am waiting on the floor now
Just another minute more now
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do

When they play something dreamy
You will see me waltz away from everyone
And when I tango
All the gang go
Off the floor to watch the fun

Aye! There must be a million
Of the tunes that aren't Brazilian
So I can't understand why they don't play a few
Ah! The band's about to start now
There'll be music in my heart now
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do

When they play something dreamy
You will see me waltz away from everyone
And when I tango
All the gang go
Off the floor to watch the fun

Aye! There must be a million
Of the tunes that aren't Brazilian
So I can't understand why they don't play a few
Ah! The band's about to start now
There'll be music in my heart now
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do

Ho-ba! Ho-ba!
