My old flame 
I can't even think of his name 
But it's funny now and then 
How my thoughts go flashing back again 
To my old flame 

My old flame 
My new lovers all seem so tame 
For I haven't met a gent 
So magnificent or elegant 
As my old flame 

I've met so many who have fascinating ways 
A fascinating gaze in their eyes 
Some who took me up to the skies 
But their attempts at love were only imitations of 

My old flame 
I can't even think of his name 
But I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became 
Of my old flame
