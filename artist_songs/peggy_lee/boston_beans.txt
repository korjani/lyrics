I took a trip to Boston
I was feeling in the mood
For a plate of that wonderful famous food
When I got there I had a big shock
Just about as big as a whole city block

They have no beans in Boston
Plenty of fish
Chinese food if that's your dish
Steaks and chops are a beautiful fair
I couldn't find any Boston beans there

When Captain John Smith came in 1614
He was the first diplomat that the Indians had seen
If they had Boston Beans than I really wouldn't know
Got to admit that was a long time ago

No beans in Boston
Plenty of fish
Chinese food if that's your dish
Steaks and chops are a beautiful fair
I couldn't find any Boston beans there

And when Paul Revere rode his horse that night
And lit those lanterns before the big fight
He must of been hungry when he got back
Boston beans would of been a beautiful snack

They have some tea leaves left from that well known party
Great museums if your feeling hearty
They have Cambridge and Harvard and MIT
The didn't have any beans for me

No beans in Boston
Plenty of fish
Chinese food if that's your dish
Steaks and chops are a beautiful fair
I couldn't find any Boston beans there

I love Boston but there's no beans there
