Why are the stars always winkin' and blinkin' above?
What makes a fella' start thinkin' of fallin' in love?
It's not the season, the reason, it's plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune

What makes a lady of eighty go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander in search of a goose?
What puts the kick in a chicken, the magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune

Listen, listen, there's a lot you're liable to me missin'
Sing it, swing it any ol' way and any ol' time
The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies, the cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker, the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies, the cop on the beat
The baker and the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

They all sing Elmer's tune
They all sing Elmer's tune
Sing Elmer's tune
