There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
He belongs to you.

An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire, they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.

So be my gypsy;
Make love your guiding light,
And let this pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.
