I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him?
I've been changed, yes, really changed
In these past few days, when I see myself
I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man, he's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways, he's just one more

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?

Don't you think it's rather funny
That I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been running every show
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
What's it all about?

Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know, he scares me so
I want him so, I love him so
