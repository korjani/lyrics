Oh, Bill
Why can't you behave 
Why can't you behave?
How in hell can you be jealous
When you know, baby, I'm your slave?
I'm just mad for you
And I'll always be
But naturally... 

If a custom-tailored vet

I could never curl my lip 
To a dazzlin' diamond clip

Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way

There's an oil man known as "Tex"

Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way

There's a wealthy Hindu priest
Who's a wolf, to say the least

There's a lush from Portland, Ore
Who is rich but such a bore

Mister Harris, plutocrat
Wants to give my cheek a pat
If the Harris pat means a Paris hat, Bébé,  Oo-la-la!

From Ohio, Mister Thorne
Calls me up from night 'til morn

Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
