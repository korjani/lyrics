(Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
(May your ev'ry New Year dream come true)

Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

(Santa's on his way)
(He's filled his sleigh with things)
(Pretty things for you and for me)

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours, ev'ryone

(Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
(May your ev'ry New Year dream come true)

Merry Christmas!
