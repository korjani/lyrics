(If you should go, if you should leave him alone
There'll be no spring or birds to sing
There'd be no sun to shine on him)

If you go, if you love me no more
If I know that you want me no more
Then the sun would lose its light
And day turn into night
Night without stars
Deep night without stars

If you go, if you leave me alone
If I know you're no longer my own
Winter would replace the spring
The birds no more would sing
This cannot be, stay here with me
My heart would die I know
If you should go

Winter would replace the spring
The birds no more would sing
This cannot be, oh, stay here with me
My heart would die I know
If you should go
