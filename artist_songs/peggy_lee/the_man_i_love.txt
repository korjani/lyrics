Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best
To make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both
Won't say a word

Maybe
I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure
To meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday
Will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'd never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting
For the man I love
