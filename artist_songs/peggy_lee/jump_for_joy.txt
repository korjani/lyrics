Fare thee well, land of cotton
Cotton lisle is out of style
Honey child
Jump for joy

Don't you grieve, little Eve
All the hounds I do believe
Have been killed
Ain't ya thrilled?

Jump for joy
Have you seen pastures groovy?
Green pastures was just a technicolor movie
When you stomp up to heaven and you meet old Saint Pete
Tell that boy
