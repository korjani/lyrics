Well - who is the hippie that's happening all over our town?
Tearing up chicks with the message that he lays down
Who is the coolest guy, what is, what am?
That's fast-talking - slow walking - good-looking Mohair Sam.

Chicks are making reservations for his loving so fine (so fine)
Screaming and shouting he's got 'em all waiting in line
Who is the coolest guy, what is, what am?
That's fast-talking - slow walking - good-looking Mohair Sam.
