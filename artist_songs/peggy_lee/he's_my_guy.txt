Well, he's my guy, I don't care what he does
'Cause he's my guy, I guess he always was
He's careless about me, sometimes I don't think he tries
But once in a while he'll hug me and smile
Then I can see me in his eyes

Oh, he's my guy, I know he'll always be
And I will try to keep that guy loving me
However he wants me, I'm his until I die
For nobody knows better than I
That he's, yeah, he's my guy

He's my guy, I know he'll always be
And I will try, try to keep him loving me
However if he wants me, I might be his until I die
'Cause nobody know better than I
That he's and he'll always be my guy
