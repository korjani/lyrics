There is no greater love
Thank what I feel for you
No sweeter song
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to thin that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Thank what I feel for you
