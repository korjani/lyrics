Don't cry, there'll be another spring
I know our hearts will dance again
And sing again, so wait for me till then

Be glad the bird is on the wing
Another time to love
And laugh with me, just wait and see

I love you now
And I'll love you forever
Oh don't be sad
We'll surely be together

For the sky is bluer overhead
If you will just believe in me
There'll be another spring
