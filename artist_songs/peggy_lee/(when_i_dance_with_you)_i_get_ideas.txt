When we are dancing and you're dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you, so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you, 'cause I care more than I care too
And when you touch me, and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight & still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying, that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true, the lovely idea
That I've fall in love with you

Your eyes are always saying, the things they're never saying
I only hope they're saying, that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true, the lovely idea
That I've fall in love with you
