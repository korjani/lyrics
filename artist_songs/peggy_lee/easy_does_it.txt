You said you needed love to warm you in the night
So you gave yourself to strangers, who left you crying at first light

You think the world you live in doesn't notice you
But don't you worry, baby, I'll be there to comfort you

So take it easy, easy
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow, I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow

So weep no more, my lady, don't you cry
I can't paint your portrait with those tears in your eye

But I can give you love, every night and day
An' we will walk together, the sun and moon will light our way

So take it easy, easy
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow, I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow

I'll tell you something you'll understand
Grab a hold now, baby, and I'll lead you to the promised land

I'll make you feel so good, make you feel alright
Chase away the shadows and keep you warm at night, ooh, I'll keep you warm

Take it easy, easy
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow, I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow

Gonna keep you smiling and satisfied
Nothing but blue skies on a magic carpet ride

Take it easy, easy
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow, I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow

Anywhere the four winds blow, I'll take you there

Here we go, baby, hold on

No more worry, no more pain
The sun is always shining, and it never, ever rains, and it never, ever rains
And it never, ever rains
