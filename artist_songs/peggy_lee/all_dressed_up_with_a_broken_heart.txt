I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
Pretending I'm with you
Someone else in my arms
Only brings back your charms
It's a game I just can't
Carry through

When I'm alone
And the teardrops start
I realize it's true
I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
And still in love with you

When I'm alone
And the teardrops start
I realize it's true
I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
And still in love
And still in love
I'm still in love with you
