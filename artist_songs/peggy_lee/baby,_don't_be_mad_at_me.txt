Baby, don't be mad at me.

If I made you cry, I'm sorry.
Baby, don't be mad at me.
If I told a lie forgive me.
Baby, don't be mad at me.

I know that I was wrong, 
but I've paid for my mistake.
Won't you string along?
Give a broken heart a break?

I love only you, believe me.
Baby please be glad at me
