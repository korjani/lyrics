Not talkin' 'bout a year
No not three or four
I don't want that kind of forever
In my life anymore
Forever always seems 
to be around when it begins
but forever never seems 
to be around when it ends
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do From you

People spend so much time
Every single day
Runnin' 'round all over town
Givin' their forever away
But no not me
I won't let my forever roam
and now I hope I can find
my forever a home
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do
From you

Like a handless clock with numbers
An infinite of time 
No not the forever found 
Only in the mind
Forever always seems 
to be around when things begin
but forever never seems 
to be around when things end
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do
From you
