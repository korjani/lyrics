I'm leaving here on the morning train
And I will never see this world again
I've felt pleasure
And I have felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same

How I wonder why the world can be so cold
And if only good die young
Then left with me cruel here to grow old
And I felt pleasure
And I felt pain
And I know now 
I can never be the same 

And if someday I find my peace of mind
I will share my wealth with all of human kind
I've felt pleasure
And I have felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same

So if the sun does shine or rain does fall
I give thanks I've had my sight to see through it all
And I've felt pleasure
And I've felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same
