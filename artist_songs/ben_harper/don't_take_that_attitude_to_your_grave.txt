You say what's mine is mine
And what's yours is mine too
Now you've got more than you can spend
But all of the money 
In the whole wide world
Is not gonna help you in the end
Now while there's still time to be saved
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Might be too late for you I'm afraid
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Don't you take it there

I hear helicopters 
Over my house every day
Shining their lights and flying low
Treat a child like a criminal 
From the day that he is born
And you're gonna reap just what you sow 
Now while there's still time to be saved
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Might be too late for you I'm afraid
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Don't you take it there

So you can move your court case
Way across town
You can move it across the whole wide globe
But it ain't gonna help your court case
Up in the sky
When you go to put on your white robe
Now while there's still time to be saved
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Might be too late for you I'm afraid
They don't want it there
Don't you take it there

And you dare the children 
To stay off of drugs
Now I dare you to stop letting them in
And how dare you point your finger
At a gang out on the street
While it's you who is committing the sin 
Now while there's still time to be saved
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Might be too late for you I'm afraid
Don't take that attitude to your grave
Don't you take it there
They don't want it there
You know your mother taught you better
Don't take that attitude to your grave
