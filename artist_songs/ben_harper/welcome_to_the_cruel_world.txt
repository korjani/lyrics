Welcome to the cruel world
Hope you find your way
Welcome to the cruel world
Hope you find your way
It's a cruel world 
Try to enjoy your stay

Yes it is a cruel world
When you're tryin' to get by
It's a cruel world
When you've seen the look in their eye
Makes life hard living
But I'm so scared to die

Welcome to the cruel world
Welcome
Welcome

Don't know how 
We've lasted here so long
There must be more good than bad
Or we'd already be gone
And if you get up to heaven
Before I do
I'm gonna tell ya
It's gonna be cruel there too

You can't hide from this cruel world
Cause there is no place to run
You can't hide from the cruel world
There just is no place to run
It's been cruel from the beginning
It will be cruel when we're done

So when I'm gone
I will gladly say goodbye
When I am gone 
I will gladly say goodbye
And if you want to feel me
Put your hands up to the sky

Welcome to the cruel world
Welcome
Welcome
Hope you find your way
Try to enjoy your stay
