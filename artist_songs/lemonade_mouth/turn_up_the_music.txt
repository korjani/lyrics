Na na na na na, na na

Take a look around
Who would have thought we'd all be here?
So let's mess around
Cause the future is unclear
We got nothing better to do
We're just trying to get through
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Let the music groove you
Let the melody move you
Feel the beat and just let go
Get the rhythm into your soul
Let the music take you
Anywhere it wants to
When we're stuck and can't get free
No matter what, we'll still be singing
Come on, come on
Turn up the music
It's all we got
We're gonna use it
Come on, come on
Turn up the music
Yeah

All we have is now
Let's make the most of this
Come on break it out
So everyone can hear it
They don't have to understand
But we'll make them if we can
Do you hear me?
Are you with me?
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Let the music groove you
Let the melody move you
Feel the beat and just let go
Get the rhythm into your soul
Let the music take you
Anywhere it wants to
When we're stuck and can't get free
No matter what, we'll still be singing

Come on, come on
Turn up the music
It's all we got
We're gonna use it
Come on, come on
Turn up the music
Yeah

Come on, come on
Turn up the music
It's all we got
We're gonna use it
Come on, come on
Turn up the music

[Chorus:]
Let the music groove you
Let the melody move you
Feel the beat and just let go
Get the rhythm into your soul
Let the music take you
Anywhere it wants to
When we're stuck and can't get free
No matter what, we'll still be singing

Come on, come on
Turn up the music
It's all we got
We're gonna use it
Feel the beat and just let go
Get the rhythm into your soul

Let the music take you
Anywhere it wants to
Come on, come on
Turn up the music
Yeah
