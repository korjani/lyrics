It's what you want
It's your amphetamine
Another night you're settling
For comfort in your bed

The more you fill
The more you're empty
You're never what you should be
Here is why you're sad

You're miserable
When he is close
So take another drink
Another drink will numb those senses

And make the most
Of flesh and bones
If it helps you
Fall asleep

I'm watching you change
It doesn't have to be this way
It gets harder everyday
So you keep numb to feel safe

Fuck what you know
Can't you see its shallow?
Every time you swallow-
Do you get a taste of what you've become?

Regrets, they wake you in the morning
You shower but you're not clean
Please just listen

I still remember the days
When you didn't feel the need to escape
And every demon you never face
Is the reason you're not safe

Please understand that you've had every chance
You've had all the time
All the time in the world

You don't listen
