I thought I found someone
I thought I had something I could trust
I still can't believe what happened
It's not that you lied to us
It's not that our friendship was a front
It's just that I can't see the real in you

Yeah for years I was afraid
Now I can finally say

That I'm afraid that you've become
Everything that you had hated
I'm waiting
For this to blow away

How could I have been so blind
How could I have ignored so many signs
Especially when my friends warned me
About your deceptive side
And that your friendship was a lie

Yeah for years I was betrayed
Now I can finally say

That I'm afraid that you've become
Everything that you had hated
I'm waiting
For this to blow away

I've been working for
Something oh so fake
But it's never too late

To correct the faults
So many others made
I know you don't care about whats right or fair

I heard you say your future is looking so great

I've been working for
Something oh so fake
But I'm not working for you no more
