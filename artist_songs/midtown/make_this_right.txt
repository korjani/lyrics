These times are tough 
I know, but it's okay 
'cause there are no directions 
We'll make them up on the way 
I was thinking back 
To a time, I was afraid 
It's not so long ago 
In fact I think it's today 

So why don't we start 
Here with this broken heart? 
'cause I can't fix it on my own 

We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 

Maybe we're growing up 
Or apart, but it's okay 
'cause while I'd love to stay now 
I think it's time to run away 
What else can I do? 
I say and with that in mind 
To make this last forever 
I think we're running out of time 

So why don't we start 
Here with this broken heart? 
'cause I can't fix it on my own 

We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 
We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 

We've got to make this right 
We've got to make this right 
We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 

We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 
We've got to make this right 
We've got to fix it tonight 

Tell me (We've got to make this right) 
You think 
We'll get through everything (We've got to fix it tonight) 
Tell me (We've got to make this right) 
You think 
We'll get through everything (We've got to fix it tonight)
