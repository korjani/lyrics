Some might say we're armed and dangerous
Pay the price of the life every night but it ain't enough
Pain is the name of the game when they play with us
Say what you say but that lane ain't the same for us

Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"

Some might say we're armed and dangerous
Pay the price of the life every night but it ain't enough
Pain is the name of the game when they play with us
Say what you say but that lane ain't the same for us

We all bend the rules, we know what to do
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to prove
We all bend the truth, take a walk in our shoes
We just wanna cruise, nothing to prove

Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"

Mama, look at where a nigga at
I can see I'm slipping through the cracks
Feeling like a fucking captain, I'm smashing the pedal
I ain't never looking back
All I really ever wanted, to be honest
Was to put my niggas on and now we running it
This shit was never really promised to me
So I probably should be acting like a nigga humble
You gotta love it when you know you got the fucking juice in this motherfucker
That's why we ride like troops through this motherfucker
Sunset, no roof in this motherfucker
Tommy Lee, Motley Crue in this motherfucker
Okay, now hold up, wait a minute
Y'all ain't let me finish
Fuck you mean, this all about my niggas
Fuck them other niggas and these bitches
Tell 'em that we winning, we the new religion
Rolling and they tied up in the Benz
With all our windows tinted, still though

Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
Unforgiven, riding down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas
Screaming "Oh, my lord"
