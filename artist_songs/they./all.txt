Pour a cup of liquor
Got some things that you going through
Go on let your guard down
You know I got some problems too

Know you need
Know you hurtin'
Got the call, you know I'm coming
You ain't gotta worry 'bout anything
Give it all of me, all of me

All you need
All you want
All the rights and the wrongs
Let me in, let it go
For the night, give it all

Pour a cup of liquor
Got some things I can show you
Go on let your guard down
I'd do anything for you

Know you need
Know you hurtin'
Got the call, you know I'm coming
You ain't gotta worry 'bout anything
Give it all of me, all of me

All you need
All you want
All the rights and the wrongs
Let me in, let it go
For the night, give it all
