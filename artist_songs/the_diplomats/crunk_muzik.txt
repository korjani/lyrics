[Juelz Santana]
Now this here is that bomb diggy (diggy)
Diggy dang, the dons with me
Killa, willll kill a nigga you thinkin' bout harming me
Capo's corrupted (yup), he's the wrong vato to fuck wit (yup)
Labeled and known as a young Pac to the public
And me, Human Crack in the flesh 
I'm the last of the best 
One word to describe me (what), spectacular, YES!
So stay calm shorty, when you see that palmed .40 
I'll pop it slow, you'll rock and roll, like Bon Jovi
So don't fool with the click (Ey)
Don't fool with the Dips (Ey)
You will die, you will lie in a pool full of shit (Ey!)
When that gun with the clip in (what)
Start dumpin' and rippin', (yup)
At ya'll head, ya'll some dead summamabitches (Ey!)
You give a chick hard dick and bubblegum (Ey)
I give a chick a hard brick and bubble-yum (Ey!)
Like here, take that, shake that, break that (Ey!)
In half and please bring me cake back

Show you how to get that powder shit
Filed the fifth, jet out of it
My proud of what is yo' turn, Jim so burned
Live bitch, why kiss, on my wrist a glowworm
And I keep heat, cause in these streets (what you hear?)
Just hear woop, woop, whant, whant, beep, beep (that's the cops)
And you rumble, never, me, hit a humble diva
And I stay with the white, I got Jungle Fever
So tell Lucceey (what)
That her boobi's, loco, cookie monster,

You be yellow-taped, outlined, etch-a-sketch
