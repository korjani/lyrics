Everybody's not alike
Some got a wallet full of pride
But even Ian isn't right
Cuh even Peter had a price

[Verse 1:]
I couldn't breathe down here
We make paper from the trees down here
Insomnia, couldn't sleep down here
Cuh everybody's tryna wake up in their dreams down here
The birdies are mad for my rhyme flute
Return of the mack, they like iTunes
They press my buttons when they tell me iChat
Cause I am Alfie to cats, got the gift of the gats, fact

[Hook - Owen Cutts:]
When I come up for air
What do the people say? Yeah
Boy have you heard that sound
Coming out the stereos round my town?
Oh yeah, boy have you heard that sound
Coming out the stereos round my town?

[Verse 2:]
A price he had, I guess unfortunate
I've started to spring, I'm quite important
Spend summer with me, I might leave autumn
I might MC, the Pisces walked in
I need precautions for Cindy Crawfords
Don't need a foursome, I need divorcing
Why? Cuh I'm Mr. Flirtatious
Tryna put Alesha's name on my playlist
This ain't like back in the day, I'm now famous
Snap snap, papping away, they might chase us
Yeah, and what's popping up in here?
Call me Mr. Asthmatic when I'm popping up for air

[Hook]

[Bridge - Owen Cutts:]
Hey boy, what's that sound coming out my stereo?
Hey boy, what's that sound coming out my stereo?
Can you repeat, can you repeat that song? Yeah
Can you repeat, can you repeat that song? Yeah

[Hook]
