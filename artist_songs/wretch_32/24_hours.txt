[Hook:]
I said “no, I’m tired”; they say “yes you can"
Push me to the fire, they say that you’re the man
I said "no I’m tired”; they say “yes you can"
Push me to the fire, they say that you’re the man

[Pre-Verse:]
Toast to the new age supermen
And fly around the globe
And leave home, to do shows
Our 24 hours is a week for most
Toast to the new age supermen
And fly around the globe
And leave home, to do shows
Aw, 24 hours is a week for most

[Verse 1:]
I gotta smile even when I feel let down
I just gotta live ready
I put the world on my shoulders before I left out
Shit, way too heavy...
"How dare you be tired, let alone stressed out?
Man, you're on the telly."
"And how can you moan about rollin' around?
Ain't you got a Bentley?"
Let me show you where I get lost
When I get picked up and I jet off
And I get picked up when I get off
Straight to hotel like "Get washed
Do interviews and press shots,"
Then I hit the venue get my "Wretch" on
Feelin' hungry lookin' at the restaurant
But we gotta rush for our flight
Gotta get gone

[Verse 2:]
And I get picked up when I get off
And I do a few photos with some new press
Trying to sound alive when I feel like death
Don't know what I need more, food or rest?
Bein' rude ain't "Wretch" so I've gotta take a picture
I'm with y'all when I ain't even with ya
Said "follow me back" my only problem with that
Is that my battery's flat, there's no twitter
No twitter, no BB
In the back of car the new ET
I wanna phone home, believe me
But I can hear in your tone that you need me
It's ironic that I spoke to the sun
Before I spoke to my son
Looks like I'm gettin scared of familiar voices
And that's somethin that I'm really annoyed with
It's like the things that seem to mean most
Just end up one of my a million choices
So how do I how avoid this?
Without hearing your pointers?

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
You're the man [x5]
(Yo Wretch, Wake Up; Wake up, We're here)

[Verse 3:]
That sleep in the car felt like a few hours
It was just a few minutes
And I reach for my Red Bull to get some power
But I forgot it was finished
Went straight into makeup to get that powder
For that fake star image
Now go look alive, then they throw me my mic
And I'mma straight up kill it
Ladies say I got gorgeous cheeks
Smile for the pictures before I leave
My head's been spinning since 4 or 3
So after the flash I see four of me
The whole team's spirits like a cord I see
Just find the first place and it's soon on me
One more PA, then we all can sleep
That 24 hours was an awesome week

That 24 hours was an awesome week

That 24 hours was an awesome week

Welcome to the darkest alley
Happiness seems so saddenin'
How are you standing?

Welcome to the darkest alley
Happiness seems so saddenin'
How are you standing?
The hunger's gonna feed you action
