[Hook - Wretch 32:]
Real nigga on my left, real nigga on my right
I'mma make sure we all live before we die
Always tell me down, now I'm putting you on the fly
We're drinking in the sky tonight
Thinking bout my ex, I will not forget ya
Thinking bout my next, I better not regret ya
We're all alike, baby that's born to fly
We're drinking in the sky tonight, drinking in the sky

[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
Once carried the heat, now I carry the torch
Brought celebs to their ends, brought the ends to the wards
Hated leaving the hood, fell in love with my soul
Praying up in the plane like I'd really came from the floor
My chauffeur opened my door, almost told him that I ain't on
Then I remembered just where I came from
Grinding, even my mother she had a cape on
Five kids, flying to work, that's a faith job
Yeah, that's why I celebrate with siblings
The only way is Wretch's, Lauren Pope can be my witness
Tryna find a message in a bottle, let me sips it
Nigga looking like he won the lotto with his big grin
I swear I couldn't stay for this
Nearly broke my knees tryna pray for this
And now I swallow that pride
We're drinking in the sky tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chip:]
North side prince, yeah that's self-acclaim (that's right)
Clean-cut nigga in a dirty chain
Small fry to big Chip, my nigga, I do big things
You buy chicken, I might buy a chick king
A path picked me, I didn't pick a career
I just stick with my circle, to hell with your squares
If you don't love me then fuck you, you can die and be cleared
Look, I just bought me a crib and bought my family's a-rares
You ain't made your mother proud, you ain't one to talk
That Roley you saw in the window was the one I bought
I don't fuck with these kids, you know I straight abort
And who needs a baby mother, when I'm cool with yours?
Please don't ask me what I do for the streets
The food you just copped just might've came from me
If you ain't seen me in a while, you ain't supposed to, G
I'm busy making tea pot, go and pot your tea

[Hook]

[Chip:]
Camera snap when we walk past, like what you doing?
Nigga it went from heat to heat
North side's on our side
Everyone remembers us
Success is a journey not a destination
We're just on our way
Let's go
