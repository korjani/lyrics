[Verse 1: Chip]
I've got eyes in my back and in my front
So I see where I'm going and keep eyes on you punks
If your career's dead, I could bring it back
I resurrect people, ask
I owe not a thing, paid all my debts
It's only broke boys that don't pay me respect
And all these fuckboys are hating
It's a bloody good ting, say I never come from ratings
Yeah, I've got my back against the ropes
Their favourite MC's probably broke
Priorities in check, I'm on a roll
I don't wanna be the guy that when I die they all cry
Listening to my shit like "damn he was cold
He had lyrics, he had flows, kinda fucked he never sold
Damn, shoulda at least sold his soul"
Damn, it's like, I'm just playing with you
But when my second album drops it's game over
I'mma take the king, the piss and then over
Back plays Chip back on everybody's shoulder
Call me half, you're two and I'm one over

[Hook: Chip]
I'm taking over, over, over
When we rain down like showers
Please don't make me have to test my powers
Taking over

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
That Mr Universe flowing, I've got them fluent words
Zoning, I hit the studes to work, focused like I can move the Earth
Kill it, right? Like when they dim your lights
I've been popping eyes, now it's time to get my spinach right
Give it time, they told me, I gave away my Roley
Jewellery means nothing because it never holds me
Just knowing I can speak for days, the feeling's irreplaceable like Jigga's dame
I'll hit the stake, keep the flow sharper than sixty blades
Rip away literally, R.I.P
Whose time is it? They're saying that it's half past me
Half passed out, when I pass through like stars do
Double decker flow, just say I buss past you
The world is my oyster, I'm a business
I'll employ ya, Wretchroboys got your boy up
Fuck, so I'm running from the tax man
Effort they can fax man
They can die fighting for my cheese on the rat trap
While I've got my backpack
Full of lyrical ammunition like "bap bap"
Yeah, me and Chippy do it for the fun of it
You ain't got a talent, you're just juggling, ah

[Hook: Chip]
I'm taking over, over, over
When we rain down like showers
Please don't make me have to test my powers
Taking over
