I can't sing but I wrote you a song, yeah
Wrong notes but the melody's so clear
When I'm lost, I'm still close to gold cause I found my treasure in you
And that's priceless spending, now let me count my blessings

1 life, 2 children
3 time, 4 dreaming
5 senses, 6 words
I found my treasure in you

And that's priceless spending, now let me count my blessings

1 life, 2 children
3 time, 4 dreaming
5 senses, 6 words
I found my treasure in you

Bronze, silver, gold... no, it's you
I found my treasure in you
Nothing less than that will do
Cause I found my treasure in you

I can't sing but I wrote you a song, yeah
Wrong notes but the melody's so clear
When I'm lost, I'm still close to gold cause I found my treasure in you
And that's priceless spending, now let me count my blessings

1 life, 2 children
3 time, 4 dreaming
5 senses, 6 words
I found my treasure in you

Bronze, silver, gold... no, it's you
I found my treasure in you
Nothing less than that will do
Cause I found my treasure in you

I can't sing but I wrote you a song, yeah
