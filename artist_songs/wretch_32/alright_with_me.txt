[Hook: Anne-Marie]
No matter what I tell them
Seems I always end up misunderstood
No matter my intention
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good
I ain't even mad
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright
It's all alright with me

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
The kids don't wanna turn down
They with a bad chick hoping she ain't fertile
I got two kids, maybe I'm the third child
I just put the work in, hoping that it works out
See, I got two bitches at the same time, I know
She just drop it down till she can't go low
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, I'll throw up
When I drop Growing Over Life, I'll grow up
Say they got ice but it must be Carte D'Or
When you're living sky high, you design your own floors
Running by my ride, holding on the car door
Slip it into gear five, why I got the Porsche for
Rappers sold less, claiming that they know more
Did their core fanbase even want an encore?
I had a Cuban link, had to take my chain off
She be looking at me funny every time I take off, ayy

[Hook: Anne-Marie]
No matter what I tell them
Seems I always end up misunderstood
No matter my intention
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good
I ain't even mad
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright
It's all alright with me

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
The kids don't wanna work now
The student loan got them feeling it will work out
They even told me on the low they prefer it loud
They just turn up till they're floating with them fur clouds
See, my niece is on fleek and in love with coco
But four years ago she was singing "Don't Go"
She says she wants a watch from her favourite uncle
Michael Kors let the G-Shock, where'd the time go?
Had to ask if she knows something I don't
Had the longest conversation on the shortest drive home
Said she sees what I'm saying, staring in her iPhone
Guess she didn't get the message but there weren't a typo
Lord-a-mercy, you see the god in me?
That'll probably never let me fly economy
I never had a better dream when I was asleep
I guess the Ox in me really wants to top the league
I'mma keep gunning, keep gunning

[Hook: Anne-Marie]
No matter what I tell them
Seems I always end up misunderstood
No matter my intention
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good
I ain't even mad
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright
It's all alright with me

[Bridge: Wretch 32]
Every day I make a prayer
Lord, make sure I'm way up
I'mma make my own way up
No sleep, I'mma stay up
Every day I make a prayer
Lord, make sure I'm way up
I'mma make my own way up
No sleep, I'mma stay up

[Outro: PRGRSHN, Wretch 32 & Anne-Marie]
Stack to the clouds
On the pennies, we look down
But the pennies make pounds, what do you want now?
But the pennies make pounds, what do you want now?
We all want bags to be loud
Don't let 'em make a sound
But don't drink water till the well runs out
But don't drink water till the well runs out
Place to sleep so we're alright (alright)
Food to eat so we're alright (alright)
Alright, it's alright
Alright, it's alright
Family tree so we're alright (alright)
Bun the weed so we're alright (so we're alright)
Alright, it's alright
Alright, it's alright with me
