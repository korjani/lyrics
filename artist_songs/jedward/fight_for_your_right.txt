Kick it!
You wake up late for school man you don't wanna go
You ask you mom, “Please?” but she still says, “No!”
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

You gotta fight for your right to party

You pops caught you smoking and he said, “No way!”
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Well your mom threw away your best *beep* mag (Busted!)

You gotta fight for your right to party
To to to party to to party
Kick it

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, “What's that noise?”
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the JEDWARD Boys!

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party
To to to to party to to party
Party party
