Flood gates, can't wait
Here she comes, shut'em fast
Better shut'em fast
Too late, swept away
Feel the rush after the fact

Coming up beneath me
Never been in love so
Deeply before

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head
For the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one.

Whistle blast, lights flash
Throw a rope, grab a hold
Feel the undertow
She laughs, waves crash
What's the use I can't let her go

Coming up beneath me
Never been in love so
Deeply before

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head
For the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one.

Flood gates, can't wait
Here she comes, shut'em fast
Better shut'em fast
Too late, swept away
Feel the rush

I am close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the one

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head
For the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one.
