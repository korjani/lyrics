[Intro]

[Verse 1:]
Girl something bout you that shine
Make me wanna tell them hoes never mind
You got me all on my grind
Now I'm inclined to give you all of my time
Seems like yesterday I took you to prom
Now I'm asking your mom
She said don't let 'em make you feel like you wrong
Just graduate and keep on making them songs
So I did both now I'm on
Girl I always tried to bring you along
But you had goals and wasn't tryna be exposed to all this shit I was on
And I just wasn't involved
You wasn't patient and your mind was too strong
I don't regret it, I'm just tryna resolve
The breaks are breaking your heart
The broken pieces couldn't pick me apart
I want to finish just as good as we start
I'm tryna master the art
A love life is to become a star
You always knew that I would make it this far
But that don't make it alright
I know you want me closer to Christ

[Interlude]

[Hook:]
I've done it again

[Verse 2:]
On a honor roll with [?]
Started spitting, had to postpone college
Really hope that it [?]
Since I was young I been in tune with my conscience
Tryna make choices that are smart cause in the future they haunt you
I grind for my momma
Buy her anything she want, I'm responsible
Bra I know that I fuck her but you know that I really love you, the heart of a hustler
I lost touch with my [?] I'm thinking of money
I wanna give her my all but she ain't really tryna take nothing from me
There's nobody in the world I want more than you
[?]
Girl I prolly fuck with you when I'm forty
While I'm on a roll, I just hope you'll be there for me
I'll let you share my glory
When it's done you'll be the star of my story
Them other girls, they ain't even important
You know your purse is imported
Stay down, you gon' be riding in Porches
A long way from standing on porches
We done built a whole fortress

[Hook:]
I've done it again

[Interlude 2:]
It's crazy what can happen when you put that time in, you know
It's like we go through them ups and down
But in the end everything you work for, you know what I'm saying, it's like it's right there in front of you, you know
I feel like we only got one life so it's like we don't wanna do nothing we gon' regret, you know it's like we only got one chance to do it, do it right
And I feel like, I feel like me and you was doing it right. Feel like we do that thang
Hahaha
