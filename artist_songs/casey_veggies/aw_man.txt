You know when I know that I don't know where to begin
All these things we been through, I can't pretend
You always on my mind, me and you are much more than friends
I'm addicted to it, I don't ever want it to end
Young black boy with a bunch of stamps on my passport
I had a dream and I took that, I ain't ask for it
I prayed and prayed, I hit my knees asked Lord
Live inside the dirt, put us over in the grass more
I'm lyrical and spiritual, I live and grow
Got so big that now you just tryna let me go
Shit was all good just a week ago
Then you sent me that nine page letter
Like I don't think we should speak no more

From the belly of the beast but I made it to a beach all the way in the middle in the ocean
Not a person in sight, it's the middle of the night and your body just start floating
I understand that you're outspoken
But some things you gotta let soak in
She from the hood but she hang in a different world
She got all types in her, that's my type of girl
She a freak in the sheets but a lady in the streets
Baby you could have a baby in the lease
She pull up in sea detailed, they can tell that’s Veggies' lady in the streets
Spent like 80 on a G, she like minx so I buy her that Chanel
She told me that she wanna do her hair nails
I told her that ain't nothin' and I yelled
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
He ain't it girl you might as well go pop that nigga
What's a queen with no king, messing with a bomb ass nigga
Checkmate, I'm bossed up, I sign that nigga

At times like this, I don't know where to begin
This shit so real, there's no way I can pretend
You said you would hold me down until the end
I love life but they say the end is near (It's too late)
The preacher asked me like what you choose this path for
No demons formed against me shall prosper
She yelling at me, I'm like what you getting mad for
Bad shit tryna outweigh all the good things glad for
I'm in H-Town, D.C, first class course
I'm swagged up, Lil B, Task Force
We dunking on 'em, no we ain't touching no backboard
I wasn't getting to know her, I was getting to know this cash more
