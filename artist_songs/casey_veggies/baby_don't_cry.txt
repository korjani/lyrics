[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies:]
Guess that love shit don't last forever
We was in love but girl, now your ass whatever
Cause at the end of the day, I need my cash and cheddar
And the Gucci sneaks to match the sweater
I used to laught whenever, but now I'm mad at always
Cause when I hit you up, you be gone all day
Like when I hit you up, I be like come play
You be like, I can't I made plans today, I'm like, damn!
I thought I was your man, I thought no matter what
That you should always understand, cause I swear
My plan ain't to get up in your pants
But you need to gimme something you wouldn't give another man
I need to feel special, just like everybody do
But it sucks you ain't around, it was always me and you
We was always trynna chill, we was always trynna do us
It was a love bomb, but that shit just blew up
I know you seen them text, but that girl never knew us
I always holla'ed at her, but never gave her too much
The thing I loved about you, you was never on me too tough
But know when I holla at you, you be acting too tough

[Hook - Casey Veggies:]
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
Even though the road is hard, you can't give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
I know it ain't cool but shit will get better

[Verse 2 - Casey Veggies:]
I really love how you were, just thinking 'bout your future
And trying to get your homework done, that was so super
I didn't wanna lose ya, but that don't mean I did
But we ain't talk lately and that shit kinda weird
And I know, I could get any girl I really search for
But really girl to me, it seem like you worth more
You something to work for, you made it so hard
I think that's one of the reasons you was up in my heart
I just wanted to love, I ain't want it to end
Cause I need someone to call, when I'm in need of a friend
But I guess I didn't do right, but I can't regret nothing
Cause I was just doing me and I ain't a fan of fronting
It's crazy, the sun light leave, shit get shady
And maybe, I should just leave so you could stay free
Really let go, of the part of you that made me
But if I stay gone, you will always be my baby

[Verse 3 - Casey Veggies:]
Baby don't cry, you gotta keep your head up
I know we ain't cool but shit will get better
I don't know what to do, you doing kinda [?]
So why you even crying, wipe them tears off your face
It's all tears in our way, we can think about the past
I been thinking 'bout your face, I been thinking 'bout your ass
But know when I see you I just gotta walk past
Cause everytime we get back, this shit don't ever last
It's sad, I'm telling you don't cry, cause I know I heard you inside
You smiling at my face, but you be acting like [?]
You nigga's ain't shit, man I ain't worried 'bout them guys
Them guys is something like shrimp fries, small [?], tall what I love
All the above, I'm all the [?]
And that's all just because, we we're close
And I don't even know what happened
Now a nigga just sitting here rapping, like
