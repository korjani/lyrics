[Verse 1 - Dom Kennedy:]
I don't need a pad, I don't need a glass
This bottle for me 1300 cash
Shout out to my dad I leave an extra tip
I'm from the dog pound, she do an extra trick
It's the president can I hit it from behind
While I'm sippin' spades, While I'm tippin' blades
I'm on a different wave Leo is the sign
Coppin' new shit, I really never rhyme
I'm just telling ya'll my lifestyle
Consider you my lifeline
Hoping I can make the call get some advice on the limelight
Hoping you the Dom type I been looking for all my life
Kiss me like it's 4th grade but fuck me like it's prom night
I was the nigga back then bitch I'm still on top
Album leaked a week early niggas still gon' cop
Shit I might get a car that Shaquille don't got
I don't ever fuck with soda I could never go pop

[Hook:]
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Loaning stupid swag, cloning cupid mask
Drop exclusive flows, rock it you suppose
Cropping new designs, profit it in the stores

[Verse 2 - Casey Veggies:]
Girl you stupid bad, I got super swag
Ain't seen you in a minute you need to run it back
When you run it back that's when I attack
I saw you at the party I was posted in the back
Let me see you move that body, Like you don't know how to act
DJ play my song this shit super packed
I done threw them racks, she a [?] trying to get that paper
She need a real nigga in her life she ain't trying to fuck with them haters
I was that nigga back then and I'm still on top
Drop my first shit on my own so I'm never gon' flop
She always told me boy I know we gon' pop
Now I'm seeing hella faces I came straight from the block
Ah man it's been a good year
I'm seeing faces that I probably won't see for another year
I pray to God I'm grinding hard album coming next year
Me and her busy right now, we'll probably be in another year

[Hook x2]
