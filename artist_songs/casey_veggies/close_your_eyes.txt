Close your eyes
You feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you, may

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, and then I closed and imagined
Casey with the pen is so tragic
They getting their skills up, I already had it
The broke didn't get it but the rich did
You stupid niggas think I'm talking bout gee I had 6 kids
And they never think about how the sick live
Yo, the creativity I have it
And all the songs I make is magic
That's just customized greatly
And all you Reggie Bush niggas can't shake me
We tryna eat lobster, still messin' with shaky
And what I've been thinking bout' lately
Who wanna pave me, I'm a become the king like Jay-z
Here go these vegetable, just taste me
Walking up to girls at the Grove like wassup baby
And Casey always been about the lazies
Yeah I'm so crazy, I'm so crazy

[Hook: x2]
Close your eyes
You feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you, may

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
He's stupid, what he sayin'
He foolish, why he playin'
That's what I'm hearin' day out, day in
The crowd standin' still then he takes 'em
How you doin' my brother, As-Salamu Alaykum
Thought he was the truth, then he faked him
They talk shit, then they wanna fade him
When it comes to these rhymes I just slay 'em
Yeah, I'm tryna use these rhymes to pay him
Cause I don't wanna spend the holidays in
I'm tryna won, his own thoughts chase him
Yeah I can't see no more
I respect the niggas sippin' off kilo's, four
The dough, I am the tickets to the show
Let's dance, the, tickets to the flow
Like fo' sho', and ya'll already know oh, yo

[Hook: x2]
Close your eyes
You feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you, may

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yes, and this is special delivery
I love my momma and the doctor who delivered me
I'm tired of the cold nights, all shivery
And you ain't crunk cause you got silver teeth
Huh, writers block
My mind was killing me
And yo, that song I be killing b
Like he say yo
Yes kill it see
Love to hate me, and now the young age love is crazy
But why these dreams chase me?
Thoughts came in the bunch like brady
Four words, forget you, pay me
Your personality slim, and you so shady
And I don't need an umbrella just to shade me
I'm so crazy, so I had more babies
Casey you so lazy, then I got more crazy
Got me fitted like Jordan in the 80's
So close your eyes

[Hook: x2]
Close your eyes
You feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you, may
