I'm so cold
I be wheelin' 'em in by the boatload
It's her and her friends and I'm so on
Man tell me something I don't know
Name somebody I do trust, most you niggas be too sus
Thought being a rapper was so cool
Really the shit is just too much
That don't mean that I ain't gon'
Kill the game, I'm too tough
I do my thang, my shoes up
What the real about? You can ask us
I feel it out, then I back up
I'm willin' out, if it act up
Can't get to college without FAFSA
So the youngin' on this rap stuff, gone.

I be over shit.
I be over shit.
Man I'm over this.
