[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Ha haaa Ha haaa, yeah
Aww man, man, damn
One more time, yeah
Remix, remix

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
My life is full of lust, things will never be the same
Guess I should just keep that shit moving and accept the change
I'm a rapper dawg, I'm bout to cop a chain
Iced out, Veggies shining maybe then you'll know my name
Shout out my homies on it, specially from California
Man I be killing tracks, twenty years old writings on it
I got the connect, it's time to get a lick
I put my niggas on then we generating checks
This slow as [?], I need a sponsor
Or go to Avery's college and try to be a scholar
But the thing about it, got no dollars got no knowledge
I pray "God help me prosper, keep me from imposters"
I applied to school just so I can have some options
I need a couple mil, I'm trynna do it big
If I never get my chance least you all know I live, I live
Peas and Carrots, that's my niggas
We blew up, you a eyewitness
My broad put his finger on her trigger
If any of you niggas come try and get us
But only call upon the shit you want
She lookin' good and she got a donk
I'm a take her down and then wake her up
And then let her know that I had enough

[Verse 2: C-San]
Rollin' round the city with the homies in the Fo' Do'
Number 9 Jays matching perfect with the polo
Boxing out haters in my city like pogo
Girls with seven D's, double D's taking photos
Grab them cameras, let you know you ain't dealing with no amateurs
That's your girl? Then she'll tell you all about my stamina
On the grind to the come up
Name through the city got me buzzin' like a liquor but I never pick a blunt up
Fly chicks all in the whip, you will never be [?]
But she really just admiring the come up
Funny what these chicks'll do when you making moves
I had em' propped for Veggies, picked em' up right after school
This pimpin' nigga
Gems drop, better listen nigga
Chasing all these hoes will leave you cold
Better pay attention nigga
Flashing lights, lavish nights
If I hit it once, I'm a hit it twice
Cold game
Do it for my niggas trynna maintain
Got girls blowin' like coal train
Throw a couple in the air like Soul Plane

[Hook: x2]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Hit the eastside, the hoes call me Domasito
Crenshaw nigga, from Vernon ave up to Pico
We just getting money, I barely got time to eat though
Josh that's my people, Carrots get all the freaks though
Ridin' Round Town, I'm in the back while she's driving
Take me anywhere you wanna go, just surprise me
A lot of niggas hating, I'm just now realizing
Your girl legs I will be dividing
Her pussy be open, my dick just be hiding
We just on the coasters, my niggas be riding
Everywhere I'm going, girls be so excited
I went to your showing, no hoes got invited
Come put out the beat, that shit got ignited
My vodka's from Poland, I'm not the politest
I might grab your ass, I know you finn' to like it
I told you I can't drive bitch, police done took my license
So I be Just...

[Hook:]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
And they all wanna feed my ego
When they wanna lay up in the front seat do'
With the feet up, 'Beep Beep' in the Regal
Baby hurry up, 'Skeet Skeet' she go deep throat
Then I'm going into [?], Chi Town
Top down in the summer time, brand new number 9's
I be lovin' that crap like it's ceelo
They be lovin' my crack man I'm Nino
She know that I see more C notes than you
Give me kemo, home sick and I need help
But I only medicate myself, I doctor everything that I do
I've been the one, since I was one
This game I got, it weighs a ton
These bitches go, these bitches come
She scream some more every time she cum
Orgasms and a lot of Champagne
Back spasms and diamond rings
Diamond cut, nigga it's no cut
When I yell "HiiiPower, TDE Gang"
I'm ridin' round, I'm ridin' round
The corner from success, and I made a left
Then I got it right, now fuck your life bitch Kendrick's next
I'm talkin' dick in the whole world
Your Ex and your new girl
Shit you nothin' new girl
It's better bitches than you girl
As I ride around, I'm right around the corner from success
Then I made a left and got it right
Now fuck your life, my dick is wet. Pause

[Talking: Casey Veggies]
Hold up man this my song, let me take it back real quick for ya'll

[Verse 5: Casey Veggies]
It's young Veggies
I prefer [?]
Little niggas was at home
I was grindin' 4 years on my own
Don't act like you can't see a nigga
In your past life you can't be a nigga
You can have an approach, make a lot of money
In the end you still gonna be a nigga
To the government, my covenant
Got attitude no Eazy-E
Po po's ain't seeing me
Four shows and I need some tea
Young and going through puberty
But in high school man I made the G's
My legal gonna take me far
I'm a porcupine I'll stab a heart
I shine hard off my heart
Give me the light like Sean Paul
She'll drop it low for this young nigga
Girl you should be askin' to run with us
Baby girl I'm just one nigga
I can only chill and have fun with ya
Big dreams make big figures
I'll wrap the city like big tigger
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
Going down and I'm livin'
In life you always get a choice
And I chose the right at that wisdom
Gone

[Hook: x2]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
Ah, the swagger
Dollar after dollar
Keep a bad chick with me
And I always pop my collar
If she ever got a problem
Get rid of her ass to solve it
Smash her at night
Then I kick her out in the morning
SWAG!
Swag
