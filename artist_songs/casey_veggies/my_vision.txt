[Intro:]
Yea
Yea
Oh yea
Oh yea
Yea
I got some shit to say on this one mane

[Hook:]
We made it man, we did it
She playin up, I'm livin
Girl listen to my wisdom
If you don't, you trippin
4-4, still tippin
They stepped on me, they slippin
You can work hard, try to get it on
Now bet y'all to try to take it off

[Verse 1:]
Girl go hard and take it up
It's the only thing that fulfill my dreams
Life been kinda hard ladies
So go and get me hard baby
We made it man, we did it
Me and all my niggas
Don't worry bout them critics
They don't know my digits
They don't see how we livin
I moved out the hood
I'm cool now, we good
And I knew that I could
We made it man, we did it
I treat we like my decisions
I make it in, I break it in
Not worried, about to see it later
I'm geeked up into the street truck
With the Visa and a diva
She see us, we the reason
For the season, oh Jesus
4-4, still tippin
They stepped on me, they slippin
You can work hard, try to get it on
Now bet y'all to try to take it off

[Hook: x2]
We made it man, we did it
She playin up, I'm livin
Girl listen to my wisdom
If you don't, you trippin
4-4, still tippin
They stepped on me, they slippin
You can work hard, try to get it on
Now bet y'all to try to take it off

[Verse 2:]
Young Mufassa, we was just out callers
Grew up pro scholars but never went to college
Should I feel aboliged 'cause I didn't go get knowledge?
Hell nah, men I'm on it and I'm out here getting these dollars
I won two with no shame,
Let you down, that's no way
I'd choose you first any day
Never put no one above you
You got my heart, I really love you
Sacrifice it all just because you
And if I lose it all we got each other
Yea, we got each other
We made it man
I just deposited 100 bands
In the bank doing the running man
I'm the Son of Sam, I'm the youngest champ
She go so fast and guess what
All these hoes fuck, nigga shade up

[Hook: x2]
We made it man, we did it
She playin up, I'm livin
Girl listen to my wisdom
If you don't, you trippin
4-4, still tippin
They stepped on me, they slippin
You can work hard, try to get it on
Now bet y'all to try to take it off

[Outro:]
You appeared as my friend, I thought we was homeys
And that time passed, you kinda outgrown me
I mean you kinda don't know me
And don't trust my wisdom
Take you on them vacations,
But first you gon see my vision
Yea, but first you gon see my vision
Yea, but first you gon see my vision
But first you gon see my vision
Yea, but first you gon see my vision
