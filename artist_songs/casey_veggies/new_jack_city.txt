[Verse 1:]
Cause I'm still tryna find it
And if I see it I'll be blinded
And if I meet her she'll remind me
Damn girl I'm just asking
Young Veggies went pro, no college
Signed my first deal, seen a lot of commas
Young black president like Obama
Told my family that I get em and yeah that's a promise
And I would never break, never fake
You only get what you could take cause they ain't handing out no plates
And I'm starving, the new sargent
I'm the type of nigga to get it regardless

[Pre-Hook:]
The game I fell in love with it
I'm tryna see what's up with it
She thinking I'm a drug dealer
Like where that money coming from nigga

[Hook:]
They don't really believe, it's driving 'em insane
Rock my own clothes and paved my own lane
Going to get this cash the only thing on my brain
You see them bright lights
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame

[Verse 2:]
Veggies on that new shit, Life Changes my Blueprint
Sleeping In Class my Illmatic, [?] exclusive
All my dreams intrusive, I'm thinking like Steve Jobs
I been rapping since 13, I ain't never had bigger jobs
In middle school I used to intern at [?]
Now I got my own store, the boy gettin' his own dough
I paved my own lane, I got my own flow
Childhood like propaine, they knew I was gon' blow

[Pre-Hook:]
The game I fell in love with it
I'm tryna see what's up with it
She thinking I'm a drug dealer
Like where that money coming from nigga

[Hook:]
They don't really believe, it's driving 'em insane
Rock my own clothes and paved my own lane
Going to get this cash the only thing on my brain
You see them bright lights
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame

[Verse 3:]
Baby girl, she the baddest
She gon' buy my album even if it's all ad-libs
Gold chain, gold ring, gold magnets
Sayin' she in love but she just wanna swipe my plastic
That's the typical yeah girls love fashion
I'm a young king, need a queen above average
I spit about that money cause I'm killin' all this rap shit
You feeling like a hater tryna find a way to bash it

[Pre-Hook:]
The game I fell in love with it
I'm tryna see what's up with it
She thinking I'm a drug dealer
Like where that money coming from nigga

[Hook:]
They don't really believe, it's driving 'em insane
Rock my own clothes and paved my own lane
Going to get this cash the only thing on my brain
You see them bright lights
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
She fell in love with that fame, fame
