[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies:]
I said I made it out the situation
Don't know how I made it out, this shit was crazy
It's my time to shine I gotta make a statement
We just searching for some inspiration

[Hook - Casey Veggies:]
You know this your jam, LA to Japan
Baby this your chance to forget your man
She's from the mother land, I'm from another land
So tell me what's the plan
Lately I've been spending time on the west coast
Money on my mind, I'm like let's go
Life been up and down but I'm blessed though
Baby hold it down for the set though

[Verse 2 - Casey Veggies:]
I'm still dancing outside when it's raining
On a cloud feel like I'm hydroplaning
I'm so high, I'm touching out of space and
We can do whatever girl use your imagination
That time is money girl don't keep me waiting

Damn girl I love the way your momma raised ya
The way you do it make a boy feel so amazing

[Verse 3 - Dom Kennedy:]
Some type of [?] while it's raining
The bayou girl okay then let's go cajun
I'm so high, I'm so high I'm touching outer space
Tryna buy Tyson old crib out in Vegas
How 'bout a plane we can go on dates with
An X-Box we don't even play with
At times all I had was imagination
And my boy just got life, we from different places
