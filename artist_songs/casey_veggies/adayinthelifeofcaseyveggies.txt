Told Me To Put Her In A Rhyme, So I Guess This Is Her Time
And She Still Got Time, So Let Me Know Tell The Mack Get Back
She Was Real Cool Plus Her Ass Was In Tack But Ion't Know My Mind Was So Flat
So Piece, All These Girls That I Just Wanted To Get A Piece
Can't Forget About Llyoda Spanish Chick, Or Puerto Rican
So I Guess That Was More Language For The Freakin
We Went Out Or Whatever She Was Down, But I Had To Let Her Go
She Some What Got Around, Still Flirtin My Heart Had A Condom On
Never Birth It Yea 8th Grade Had The Chicks At The Back Door
But Couldn't Get With Me I don't know Why, The Knob Was Real Slippery
Oh Yea The Breeze, Her Style Was To Hot For The Breeze How We Felt
About Each Other Was Other But I Had To Leave Her For The Other Son
Of My Mother... Then A Good Friend Got Me, Met Her At The Party Her Name Was Rocky
I Was Liking Her A lot For What She Was Not Not Not, Let Me Stop, Like She Stop
Hittin Me Up Ion't Know, Call Me Or Something When You Ready To Go

Yeah
Life fades as the sun raise
Your love is like a nice fade and some new J's
And 07 was the year we went to heaven
I didn't expect it, everything just crept in
My next sin turn the lights off girl, you my weak spot
Even though I might talk girl, you just white talk girl
Freeze the boy then you leave me there, it ain't fair, (I know)
I still got time to go
I tell my friends all the time aboutcha
So I would really be quiet withoutcha
Do you feel special that this rap is for you
When you hung up on me I wanted to tear you in twos
What am I supposed to do
All my lies stay true
Look in your eyes make me blue
Then they, turn red and I'm all in your head
We can sit and watch TV, and lay on my bed
My mom will take you home later
I'm always doing favors cause I'm loving every flavor
Sweet like a life savor, your a life savor
Because you changed my thoughts
That's why when we get the movies yo ticket gets bought
And if a nigga try to talk to you, he gon get hawked down I hate that shit
I would never get in-between another dude and his girl,
So why all these lame dudes try to ruin my world
He calling your phone and it's making me hurl
I wanna pick up the phone and say this is my girl, what you need what you want
And I ain't even gon front, you get on my nerves go fly on a bird and go back where you came from, you little lame chump
But I'm a chill, I'm just tryna keep it real
I'm jut tryna give you kisses girl and show you how I feel
It's like me and you running up a steep hill, and if I get tired
You keep going and a nigga get fired, I'm on fire when you make me mad
I'm writing raps realer and I hope it don't get too bad
I wanna support you in any way no other ever had
And when I blow up with rap, you gon have everything you ever wanted and ever had
And just to think a southern girls loving a boy
But I dust em right off cause I'm loving with joy you know
And you ain't never bitter, but you made bad decisions, which then made collisions, to my heart
For what it known from the start
I don't think we would have made it this far
I woulda saw you differently
But girl I think you changed so vividly
And I respect that
It's like a set trap that got me from behind
It's not even you face girl it's everything inside
Though everything I think about what you did with them other guys my brain fries
But I know I'm you only your main guy
That was the past this is now
Like a smile plus a frown and every time I clear my mind it's going down
And every time she feel the need to you goin down making me
Feel like you care, and grabbing your hair
You a year older but I really don't care
You gave me the same chance that's wat really was fair
And I turned out to be something that really was there
I'm real mature for my age so you thought we would pair, and we did
When we grow up you having my kids
And when I think I know you it's something I feel in my ribs
Them I barbecue it got me leaving my fears
I don't act hard, your mama said you shouldn't date a rap star that's driving a fast car Well baby I'm better than that
Cause I'm real fine mannered and I know how to act
So tell mom I'm never leaving and if I do I'm coming right back
You was running round them tracks, you was running through my mind
You shine
You make me feel like everything is fine so
We gon get it together, everything gon be better
This is right around the way
And other than this song I don't have much to say
So as long as my shoulder here you got somewhere to lay
And wen we both start driving I wanna see you everyday (ok)
That's as far as I got
