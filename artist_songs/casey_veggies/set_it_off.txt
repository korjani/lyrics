[Hook:]
Nigga I don't need your feature, nigga I am a feature (I'm the man)
I set it off like Queen Latifah, she respect me like Aretha
I'm with a bad young diva and she got her faith in Jesus
We say we don't but we all need 'em, I got love for all people

With my cousin with the hood, swear that we be living good
Bad bitch looking right, at the end of the tunnel I can see the light
Getting money like I should, who else gon' pay the rent?
They all discriminate against us but who else gon' say this shit
I'm the young dope dealer, my uncle was a dope boy
My momma was a hard worker, she a beautiful woman, she shouldn't work none
I love her, I got hope for her, all them other girls get in line
If lil mama stay down, I swear I put in double time
High off life though, riding on my Puma bike though
I put my heart in everything I write though
Yeah I got stripes though
Nigga I got hood credit, yeah I got street fame
Fourth quarter I just play the game
I'm just staying in my lane

[Hook:]
The label telling me I need a feature
Nigga I am a feature (I'm the man)
I set it off like Queen Latifah, she respect me like Aretha
I said I'm with a bad young diva and she got her faith in Jesus
I got love for all people, no matter what race, all people

In Inglewood down to Louisiana, two pieces
With the fries, fresh veggies she steady eating
To be alive, baby tell me what is your meaning
Sold out shows, I just wanna do arenas
I'ma fly nigga, girl I wanna know your secrets
Put that on my life though
Put my heart in everything I write though
I'm just tryna tell my story
If the shit ain't real then I can't enjoy it, yeah I can't enjoy it

[Snoop Dogg:]
Oh, what's going on world?
It's your favorite, your uncle Snoop D-O-double-Gizzle
And you're now tuned in with my nephew Young Veggies
And we out here actin' up
