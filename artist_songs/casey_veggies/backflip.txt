Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it
Use to put money in a mattress
We do it all the time, no practice

I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies:]
I'm just a young nigga with a promise future
I gotta get this dough, nigga, no excuses
You wasn't really real, it was nice to knew you
Told God I'm only bout that real he said, "hallelujah"
Take my time but it's coming in fast though
My new chick better than my last ho
Getting money I could put your mans on it
Don't talk about it, drop bands on it
I can turn your bitch into a fan, homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
I'm the man homie, I'm the man homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
She said I got a couple friends just like me
They from the bay, hella' thick and get hyphy
Twelve months all about the cash flip
Bet that money make her do a back flip

[Verse 2 - YG:]
It's YG 4 hunnid, I got a question to ask
Would you suck dick, fuck dick and lick balls for that hang bag
Would you let me run a train up and pay your car note
If it was due tomorrow?
If you would strictly dickly would you let a bitch lick your pussy and titties, would you?
Would you fuck me then fuck my homies, you really love me though
But he was gonna' give you that mutt
She just tryna' take care of hers, she a real bitch
But if you had a baby daughter, would you still strip?
She just tryna' get rid of that stress so every question I asked she said "yeah", aye

[Verse 3 - Casey Veggies:]
Aw man, baby girl a model or a actress
I'm a go dumb on the mattress
Hit it from the front, hit it from the back end
You know she just want some satisfaction
Make her bend it over then I smacked it
I can tell that she really attracted
Run that too, man, my brody tagged it
Three hoes on me but I'm only one man
I'm faded off Patron, yeah I'm in my zone
The money make her backflip. she never going home
She do it for the books and I'm a do my stuff
Girl you know what's up, I beat the pussy up
