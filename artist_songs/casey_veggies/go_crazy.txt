Damn
Put your hands up baby
Youngin making songs
Make them girls go crazy
I do it all for the payment
Born nine-three but my girl from the 80's
I be in my Nike shit, with some fresh jeans
Young boy ballin God damn I need an ESPY
Sittin up plottin how I'm gonna make my next cheese
Chillin with my new girl thinking bout my ex feez

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Same shit from 8th grade rocking SB's, switched up my program
Now I got more fans I ain't never cocky, but I'm feeling like a grown man
Did my own thing tryna provide for my old man
And my momma working some now some...
I'm just tryna make a mill so she can get some sun tans
So when you holla at me only talk one thing money in my pocket man cause I don't want no friends
Got enough broking heart and niggas turned enemies that focus on everything they pretend to be
I met an actress I think she was feelin me, but she's an actress so who knows we gone see
Young CV, might catch me in a white tee, Jordans and a gold chain, Illmatic through my Dre Beats
If this was 98 I would have been on The Chronic
Youngest nigga in LA spittin that Hooked on Phonics

I swear you living off lies, man I live off logic and I am gonna live through my bro cause he in college
But I'm killing all these and I'm out world touring setout to age 13 was my first time recording
Shoutout to Auntie Dee-Dee Introduce me to the OC living by the ocean made life make more sense
And my cousin Josh told me always ride tints, cause these streets of LA always give you problems
But we on that fresh shit, catch me with the best chick
Introduced in '07, thought of in '06
30, 000 on me man we all keep some ladys
I got a Odd Future, shoutout to Wolf Haley
That's Tyler, The Creator give a damn about a hater
This my city, I'm the mayor, world spins cause that paper
Tiptoes in my sneakers, if she down I'm a keep her
That lame boy hating, I'm a put him in a sleeper
Swag up
