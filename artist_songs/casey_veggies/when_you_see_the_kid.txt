[Verse 1:]
Bass pumping
Time to say something
From the Fall, to May running
Never stop doing my crunches

I don't second guess nothing

Heaven sent with better sight
Call me young Veggies girl, my lettuce
Yeah, my cheddar right

My girl love me

Yeah I said that girl love me
Never put nothing above me
Don't be sorry when she suck me
I got sorrow for my Ex's
I got shooters that's my cousin
Mama routing for me lately

Know I'm running

Never pausing on my pivot
Stay on focus when you live it
Man I hope you niggas get it
That's what's good about this city

Don't just let them niggas run it
Turn that nothing into something
Get yo program into function
Get that money into doublin',
Like

[Hook:]
When you see me, see me
Put my all in what I do
Everything I'm doing now is for you
Ain't nothing new, somebody better tell them that we on!
On! UH UH-UH ON!
In a different ZONE! Call a nigga Phone!
Like we ON! Uh Uh-UH On!
In a differen't zone! She hit a nigga phone
Like we on!

[Verse 2:]
And then I had that girl drop me off
Back of my head, I won't leave the car 'til she top me off
Heard what I said?
Nahh, I shouldn't. She'll prolly take it wrong

In my own world
I live my own dreams

I had my own scheme
You don't know what it means

To get that shit in yo hands,
I never wished for a fan
If she drop it for the team,
She'll prolly leave with the grands
Had my watch out on the scene,
The crowd was waving their hands

Poppin'

Yeah, later nigga shaking them hands with Option
Pray to God, young gangsta, you'll always prosper
... what you thinking is all we got here
I believe there's much more that we can be fine with

[Hook:]
When you see me, see me
Put my all in what I do
Everything I'm doing now is for you
Ain't nothing new, somebody better tell them that we on!
On! UH UH-UH ON!
In a different ZONE! Call a nigga Phone!
Like we ON! Uh Uh-UH On!
In a differen't zone! She hit a nigga phone
Like we on!

[Verse 3:]
Forever more
Yeah...
Young Veggies...
Uh

When you see the kid, hope you see
My vision
Write my life through my flows, watch
How I'm living
Illuminate through the dark like a
Night light
We on all night, what ya life like?

Baby girl stick around for my life sake
I'll go outta town for the right cake
She watched what I did and what I might
Make
Same kid switched up the style cause the
Minds great
