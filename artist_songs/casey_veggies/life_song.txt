[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies:]
I'm the man shorty, come put them bands on it
If I get my hands on it, I can't let go I promise
My momma know I love her, she gave a chance to me
All my fans love me, they wave their hands for me
She do a dance for me, took off her pants for me
I had to catch myself and get another glance of it
I keep it 100 if you keep it 100
Real recognize real, we might get through something
Shout out to LA, shout out to Inglewood
Up at Crenshaw 9th grade then I went to Inglewood
I love to rep my city, just hope you reppin' with me
On the block all day with the extras with me
I'm a made nigga, made something out of none
On the way, all the gangstas ask me where I'm from
I said "I don't bang, I just play sports
And I write raps, don't sell my life short"

[Hook - BJ the Chicago Kid:]
Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long
Make me wait so long and why it take so long

[Verse 2 - Casey Veggies:]
Why it take so long, boy I'm tryna get on
In the studio til the morning, from the street lights come on
I swear it won't be long, got the top where we belong
And I had to experience life then I put it up in a song
I knew it all along, I could be your favorite
Girl I gotta keep it 100 with you, I can already picture you naked
Shouts to the people who hated
The ones that were telling me I never make it
But I never listen, it’s out of my statement
And I'm bout to go down as one of the greatest

[Hook - BJ the Chicago Kid:]
Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long
Make me wait so long and why it take so long
