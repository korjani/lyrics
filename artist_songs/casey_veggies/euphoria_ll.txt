[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Clap, Clap, Clap your hands
Listen 'til you understand
Under Pressure, change of plans
I'm on I'm on we do the damn thing, baby
Put your hands up high
Lifes crazy that natural high
My euphoria flyin' all in the sky
Grind hard live fast get by

[Verse 1: Casey veggies]
I don't worry 'bout these hoes
I could have been rushin' but I don't hurry round these hoes
Stephen curry with the flow
Told me every time I pull up
Flexin' on niggas like push ups
Tell them they should look up
Or maybe even get down
Got the game shook up
Ask about me in my town
I told her I don't look back
I'm all about the head first
Think about my last chick
Used to dive in head first
I'm rolling down Slauson cop the Crenshaw sweatshirt
I switched up the subject now I'm all about my bread first
The suck' niggas mad man I think I make they're head hurt
But they can keep it up cause all it do is make me better
The weather kinda hot in my city I been told you
The gang bangin' niggas don't play around they been soldiers
Me and my niggas just stay fresh like the Folgers
Opening lanes, walking right through like we moses
Posers

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
So I got my flows up
Got my shit in motion
Sound like some magic though
Guess I got the potion
Used to be ashy
But since I got some lotion
I been on my job
Ain't got a promotion
I just get it done
Ain't in the bragging or the boasting
This that natural high
That shit that how you posting
So you know I had to take pics on it
And we about that money
Went and got rich on it
I just want to let you know I'm on my shit homie
Life answers some God damn piss on it
Your girl knows my name
Hater you should get on it
So you can look at her page
And see my shit on it
I'm on my rap shit working hard living fast
And me teacher gave me F's so I'm switching out the class
These chickens 'bout the cash
Man you lames getting gas
I'm just hundred down the highway and I'm trying not to crash
