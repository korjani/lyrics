You know, the landlord rang my front door bell,
I let it ring for a long, long spell,
I went to the window, peaked through the bar,
Tell me what was on the old man’s mind.

Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna stay here with me.

I scream and I scream and I’m so hard pressed
I call the woman that I love best.
I finally reached my baby by half past three
I said I like to do what you want with me.

She said
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna get along with me.

She screamed and said “what’s wrong with you?”
Just stay home, problem is stay trough
I said, tell me, baby, face to face,
How could another man take my place?

She said
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna get along with me.

I learned my lesson and now I knew
They saw me shining, with me blue.
When my day come and where my day go
But though I say how I love ‘em so.

I want the
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna stay here with me.
