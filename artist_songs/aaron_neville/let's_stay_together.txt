I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
You make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my whole life with you

Since, baby since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us to do)

[Repeat to fade:]
Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
