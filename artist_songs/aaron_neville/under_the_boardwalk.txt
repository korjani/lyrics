Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tore up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your entire feet were fireproof.

Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby it’s where I’ll be.
Under the boardwalk, I ever saw,
Under the boardwalk, to be having some fun,
Under the boardwalk, people walking above,
Under the boardwalk, to be falling in love,
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk.

And in the back you hear the tappy sound of the carousel
You can almost test the hot dogs and French fries they sell.

Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby it’s where I’ll be.
Under the boardwalk, I ever saw,
Under the boardwalk, to be having some fun,
Under the boardwalk, people walking above,
Under the boardwalk, to be falling in love,
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk.
