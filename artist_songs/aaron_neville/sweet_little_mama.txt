[take 14: "jesus h. christ", 2-3-4]

There's a new girl in my neighborhood
She's a sweet little thing, she looks real good
She gets everybody's attention around
They call her sweet little mama

All the boys wink when they see her
Even the girls smile when they meet her
Everybody's trying to be first
To hold sweet little mama

She got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
But the minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry

Stop by my house and you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
She's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama

Say she got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
The minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry

Stop by my house, you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
Well, she's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama
