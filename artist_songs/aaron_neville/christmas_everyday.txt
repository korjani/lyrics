Messiah, help us to know You
Not only on Sunday
But through and through

On Your birthday we celebrate
When You came to us
But sometimes we forget
What You gave up for love

God gave up His begotten son
Because He loves us all
So sisters and brothers
Just love one another

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Feel like Christmas in your heart

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Keep the Christmas spirit in your heart

Messiah, show us how to cleanse our sins
[?]
All our hatred and the wars we've raised
Why can't we just trust
Sometimes we still ignore the life together lasts

Mary had the holy child
To save all mankind
So sisters and brothers
Just love one another

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Feel like Christmas in your heart

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Keep the Christmas spirit it in your heart

Mary had the holy child
To save all mankind
So sisters and brothers
Just love one another

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Feel like Christmas in your heart

And then everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
Keep the Christmas spirit in your heart
In your heart, in your heat, in your heart
