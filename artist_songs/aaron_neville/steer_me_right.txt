Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

I've been runnin' behind a train
I never could keep satisfied
Appetite for destruction
Keeps a man bound and tied

Oh, shine you goodness down on [?] me
Oh Lord from up above
In my darkest hour
Soon be, it's Your turn to love

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Mother, Johnny used to tell me
Said, "Son, don't waste your youth
As blinding of fear and hatred
And you never ever see the truth"

Oh Lord, I keep prayin' [?] wisdom
And the strength to carry on
Oh Lord, be my helper
Let Thine will in my life be done

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Come on and steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Come on, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
