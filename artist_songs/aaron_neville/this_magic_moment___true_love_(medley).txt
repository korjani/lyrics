This magic moment, so different and so new,
Like any other until I kissed you.
And then it happened, it took me by surprise
I know you felt it, too, by the look in your eyes.

Sweeter than wine, softer than a summer night,
Everything I wanna have is when I pull you tight.

This magic moment, your ear close, close to mine
Will last forever, forever, till the end of the time.

Magic, magic, magic, magic.

Sweeter than wine, softer than a summer night,
Everything I wanna have is when I pull you tight.
This magic moment while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of the time.

Magic, magic, magic, magic.
Magic, magic, magic, magic.

If you cry, my heart will break
Darling, that you moving I can take.
And if I saw a tear fall from your eye
Darling, don’t you know that I would die?

True love, true love, true love, true love.

If you cry, I don’t know what I’d do
Darling, I am so in love with you.
And if I heard that I had caused you pain
My tears will pour like the rain.

True love, true love, true love, true love.
