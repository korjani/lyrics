A breathless drive on a down town street
A motor bike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run though we'd run, it still burned our eyes
Oh yes we may walk on the wild, wild side of life,
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise take my hand
And show me a way to understand
So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes it you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
(So just lead me, lead me away)
A reckless night in a nameless town
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe
Now you may think you can walk on the wild wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hand
It's up to you to make me understand
So if you think you know how to love me
