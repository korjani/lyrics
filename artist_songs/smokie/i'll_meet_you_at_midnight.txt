A summer evening on Les Champs Elyses
A secret rendezvous they planned for days
I see faces in the crowded cafe
A sound of Laughter as the music plays.

Jeanne-Claude's student at the University
Louise-Marie is just a world away
You recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words and music as she turned away.

[Refrain:]
I'll meet you at midnight
Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight
Oh, but Jeanne-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be

Each cigarette will light a thousand faces
The shade is passing like a thousand years
Midnight was turning into empty spaces
The sound of laughter'd disappeared

[Refrain]

A summer morning on Les Champs Elyses
The entertainment in the street cafe
The sunlight melting through an open doorway
Jeanne-Claude has left some other day...
