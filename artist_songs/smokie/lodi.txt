Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse
I guess you will know the tune
Oh! Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh! Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar, for ev'ry song I've sung
And ev'ry time I've had to play while people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live

Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
