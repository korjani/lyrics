Don't talk to me of shattered dreams,
Of course you don't know what it means,
To live for someone else, you can't just take,
And when you're bitten by the truth,
You blame it on your mis-spent youth,
You never seem to learn by your mistakes.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,
Wild wild angels on the skyways,
Those wild wild angels on the highways of your life,
'Cos it's people like you who never knew,
What wild wild angels have to face.

And I ain't hangin' round to see,
You turn on someone else like me,
I'm still alive and you know the way I live,
But baby that's one way you'll never be,
Such simple things you fail to see,
You take back everything you ever give.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,
Wild wild angels on the skyways,
Those wild wild angels on the highways of your life,
'Cos it's people like you who never knew,
What wild wild angels have to face.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,
Wild wild angels on the skyways,
Those wild wild angels on the highways of your life,
'Cos it's people like you who never knew,
What wild wild angels have to face.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,
Wild wild angels on the skyways,
Those wild wild angels on the highways of your life,
'Cos it's people like you who never knew,
What wild wild angels have to face.
