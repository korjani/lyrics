Every dream that I dream
Seems to float on by
Like a cloud in the wind
Way up in the sky
Every move that I make
Seems to be the wrong way
Like a cold black night
After a summer day

What can I do
What can I do
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Nothing's the same as it used to be
What can I do

I used to play my guitar
With a smile on my face
Now everything's changed
My whole life's rearranged
From the day I was born
Sidle Jinx was my name
Though I tried and I tried
That name still remains

What can I do
What can I do
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Nothing's the same as it used to be
What can I do

What
Can I do
What
Can I do
What
Can I do
What
Can I do

I hear voices all singing
But no one's there
It's a ghost of my life
Bringing past tense to mind
Lock and key here ties me
From the freedom and sin
Oh come let me in
I'll start all over again

What can I do
What can I do
Nothing's the same as it used to be
No no no no no no no no no
What can I do

What
Can I do
What
Can I do
What
