So you caught a glimpse of someone you once knew
And you seem to find it hard to face the truth
Oh Oh, but that don't make it right
To be wantin' me tonight
When your thoughts on love keep changing all the time
well we both knew there's be things we'd have to face
But is it true that I can never take his place
Oh but I can't read your mind
For the things you hope to find
When your thoughts on love keep changing all the time
Now heaven knows I tried just everything I knew
But it seems there ain't no getting though to yu
Guess I've played out every line
Still you can't make up your mind
When your thoughts on love are changing all the time
'Guess I've played out every line
Still you can't make up your mind
When your thoughts on love keep changing all the time
