She's like a rock and I keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And she's got a lot of nerve not seeing you the way that I do.

We are, oh, we're about to be.
So much closer than you thought that we could ever be.
Well, I'm sorry to say that I gave it away.
We'll I'm empty.
You're empty.
It's none of my business, but I won't be a witness.
If I hang on for the ride I promise I will crash without her there.

She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than this.
In a life full of exits and entrances.

I know the way this plays out.
But, I couldn't find the words to tell you.
And you thought that everytime she would never tell a lie.
But, believing a liar is feeding the fire.
It's none of your business, but I won't be a witness.
No, it's none of your business, but I won't be a witness.

She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than.
Something more than this.
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than this.
In a life full of exits and entrances..

Did you get what you wanted?
Cause I couldn't get enough.
Now I'm back where I started again.

She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece, chipping off a piece.
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece, chipping off a piece.
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
Hang on for the ride.

She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than.
Something more than this.
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to.
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than this.
In a life full of exits and entrances.

It's none of my business, but I won't be a witness.
