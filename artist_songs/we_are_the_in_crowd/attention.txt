(We’re all just weird kids in the end)

Attention
I’ll walk you though this slowly if you’re still listening
Here's your penny back for stealing our thoughts
All for the sake of wanting more
Play it safe while you keep score
And one day we might find that piece of mind that we lost in the first place

I know the way I wanna be
But I’m trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is believing that I needed change
We are the only friends we have
And if there’s nothing left
And I fall, we don’t fall apart

We’re all just weird kids in the end

I tied up my laces
Left my loose ends hanging
On the words that I had wished that I’d said
Memories that keep me up in bed
Shoulda coulda would've stayed the way I’ve been
If it wasn’t for the means there’d be no end
To sleepless nights in parking lots
That light the way to make a better me
If I could write these feelings into a greater meaning
They'd fall on deaf ears

I know the way I wanna be
But I’m trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is believing that I needed change
We are the only friends we have
And if there’s nothing left
And I fall, we don’t fall apart

We don’t fall apart
We don't fall, we don't fall, we don't fall
We don’t fall apart

I know the way I wanna be
But I’m trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is not believing
We are the only friends we have
And if there’s nothing left
And I fall, we don’t fall apart

I know the way I wanna be
But I’m trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is believing that I needed change
We are the only friends we have
And if there’s nothing left
And I fall, we don’t fall apart

We’re all just weird kids in the end
