Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live oh
Take take take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand
Is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from
Bad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you smile in my face then rip the breaks out my car

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand
Is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
You would watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never ever ever did, baby

But darling I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
You never do the same
Oh, you never do the same
No, no, no, no
