You think you spent the best of your life
Like a puppet on a string
You think you got, none of it right
And there’s no time left to change
So many memories
They’re all so bittersweet
So many avenues
Back to where we were

Don’t you worry about a thing
You’re just lost inside a scream
Don’t blow it, and make your life
Nothing less than you could own it
Make it right, Nothing less than you should be
Don’t you worry about a thing
My sister

You taught me what was wrong and what’s right
And you’re proof of what it means
To be lost alone in plain sight
Things are never what they seem

Why can’t you ever see
It’s always bittersweet
The only avenue
Back to where we were

Don’t you worry about a thing
You’re just lost inside a scream
Don’t blow it, and make your life
Nothing less than you could own it
Make it right, Nothing less than you should be
Don’t you worry about a thing
My sister

Don’t tell me
You’re fading
You’ve got so much that you could be

Don’t tell me
It’s hopeless
You’re the only reason you should need

Don’t you worry about a thing
You’re just lost inside a scream
Don’t blow it, and make your life
Nothing less than you could own it
Make it right, Nothing less than you should be
Don’t you worry about a thing
My sister
