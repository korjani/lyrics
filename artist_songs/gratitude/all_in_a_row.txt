Theres a mountain of cars 
A couple miles of garbage 
God, will you look what we've started 

All in a row 
Our churches and bars 
All in a row 
Yeah, spotlights and stars 
All our guns and daughters 
Lined up all in a row 

Take a look at these scars 
Just take a look at us starving 
God get us back to the garden 

All in a row 
Our churches and bars 
All in a row 
Yeah, spotlights and stars 
All our guns and daughters 
Lined up all in a row 

Can you see it going? 
Can't you feel it go? 

And it's all in a row 
Our churches and bars 
Yeah our spotlights and stars 
All our guns and daughters 
Buried all in a row
