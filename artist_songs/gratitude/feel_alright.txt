So here we are now, again 
I'm getting sick of this again 
Getting sick of all this waiting 
To be perfect, and good 
And I'm scared of all my friends 
We're all not calling 

All our hopes and all our fears 
Letting go is love 
Hope we don't choke 
Hope we don't die 
Hope we all feel alright 
Feel alright 

Falling, is supposed to be so fun 
But all I get is sick and numb 
I'm barely breathing 
When all my fears descend 
But I'm not fallen 
I'm not dead 

All our hopes and all our fears 
Letting go is love 
Hope we don't choke 
Hope we don't die 
Hope we all feel alright 
Feel alright 

We are all so brave 
We are all so scared 
We are all afraid 
We're all not fallen 
All not dead 

All our hopes and all our fears 
Letting go is love 
Hope we don't choke 
Hope we don't die 
Hope we all 

I said  
All our hopes and all our fears 
Letting go is love 
Hope we don't choke 
Hope we don't die 
Hope we all feel alright 
Feel alright 
Feel all, feel alright
