Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Send me your letters 
Send me your letters 
I'm willing to pretend 

All I mean, is let it be 
Got options, so look around 
You're beautiful, so is she 
So is he, so look around 

I can't right now 
But let's try to talk tomorrow 
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday 

Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Send me your letters 
Send me your letters 
I'm willing to pretend 
Yeah 

Growing up, getting straight 
Move forward, so look around 
But what a mess, we've gotta make 
To get there  
Look around, around 

I can't right now 
But let's try to talk tomorrow 
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday 

Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Send me your letters 
Send me your letters 
I'm willing to pretend 

Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Send me your letters 
Send me your letters 
I'm willing to pretend 

Sadie you want me 
But what a mess we've gotta make 
To be there, will you be there 
In the end 

Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Send me your letters 
Send me your letters 
I'm willing to pretend 

Maybe we'd all better beware 
Or end up here again 
Sending our letters 
Sending our letters 
And willing to pretend 

Sadie you want me to be there 
Be there in the end 
Sadie you want me, oh 
Yeah I'm willing 
Willing to pretend 
Oh, Sadie
