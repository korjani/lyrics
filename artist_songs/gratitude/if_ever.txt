It's good to hear your voice 
It's good to hear your breathing 
You're running out of hours 
Im running out reasons 

Every time i turn around you're gone 
But tonight i won't tell anyone 

I should call the cops 
Or i should call your father 
But you're sayin' you don't care 
So maybe i won't bother 

Everybody notices when you're gone 
Everybody wonders what they did wrong 
All of us are waiting now, so long 

But tonight i won't tell anyone 
No, tonight i won't tell anyone 
No, tonight i won't tell 

Cos this time it's too late 
I wont wait up 
I wont wonder 
It's a waste 
I can see now 
I am sober 
I've been scared straight 

Everytime i turn around you're gone 
Finally you figured out what went wrong 
So whether you can hear or not 
So long 

No, tonight i won't tell anyone 
No, tonight i won't tell anyone 
No, tonight i won't tell anyone 

No, tonight i won't tell anyone
