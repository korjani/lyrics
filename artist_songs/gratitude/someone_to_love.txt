Lately I'm ashamed to say I'm starving for it 
But I want someone to love 
And you may think you're to blame 
But oh I'm so proud of you 
And I want someone to love 
Yeah I want somebody to love 

Take it easy on yourself 
Just know that you're enough 
I just need to know that, 
I want somebody to love 
Yeah I want somebody to love 

The thought of it 
Just all of it 
We wanted it maybe too much 
But better than  
To never have tried and failed again 
Oh I want somebody to love 
Yeah I want somebody to love 
Want somebody 

Take it easy on yourself 
Just know that you're enough 
You'll find it 
I want somebody to love 
I want somebody 
I want somebody to love 
Yeah I want somebody to love 
Want somebody to love 

Lately I'm amazed  
That I found someone to love 
That I found someone too 
Take it easy on yourself 
Take it easy on yourself 
Take it easy on yourself 
Take it easy on yourself 
Take it easy on yourself
