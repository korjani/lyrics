If you ever see her, lying hurt 
Don't just stare 
Please get up, get up, get up,  
Get up and help her. 
And then check her pulse 
And give her air 
And then listen and breathe  
And keep checking and checking her heart 

Don't drive away 
Don't leave her this way 
Don't drive away again 

I could never say the things  
That kept me up. 
Just lay there listening  
To your whispering 
Maybe you were supposed to help me  
Learn to love you more 
Help me to notice how we're  
Different, different, different  
All right, all right 

Don't drive away 
Don't leave her this way 
There's not enough hours in our days 
Don't drive away 
Don't drive away 
Don't walk out on her again 
Again 

(Don't drive) 
Don't drive away 
Don't leave her this way 
There's not enough hours in our days 
Don't drive away 
Don't drive away 
Don't walk out on her again 
Again, again, again 

Don't drive away 
Don't leave her this way 
There's not enough hours 
Not enough hours in our days 
Don't drive, don't drive, don't drive 
Don't drive away
