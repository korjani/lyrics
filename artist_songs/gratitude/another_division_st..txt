When the lights go out 
Do you think of death? 
Do you make a sound? 
Or do you hold your breath? 

But tonight let's celebrate it 
Love or hate it, it's ours 
Tonight, let's overrate it 
We really made it this far 
Tonight 

The places we don't know 
Someone makes our clothes 
Someone's counting sins 
It gets under my skin 

But tonight let's celebrate it 
Love or hate it, it's ours 
Tonight, let's overrate it 
Yeah we really made it this far 
Tonight 

Oh tonight let's celebrate it 
Love or hate it, it's ours 
Tonight, let's overrate it 
We really made it this far 
Oh tonight,  
We really made it this far 
This far, this far 
Yeah we really made it this far 
Tonight
