She say I got her goin round in circles
And she ain't tryna wait in line

She say I got her goin round in circles
And all I do is waste her time

She say I got her goin round in circles
Shawty just so fine

She say I got her goin round in circles
Just so I can make you mine

Damn, shawty you fine
And I got you runnin round in circles in yo mind
I would give you a second
But right now I have no time 
Like I'm related to the sun
Baby I gotta shine
Yeah, so I ain't ready to settle down 
And everytime she bring it up
I shut her down
And plus we makin too much chedda now 
And all the girls on the front row are lookin better now.

And she said that she wanna get to know me betta and she said that she hopin we can grow togetha
But I don't think that me and you can go together so baby girl do what you know is betta

She say I got her goin round in circles
And she ain't tryna wait in line

She say I got her goin round in circles
And all I do is waste her time

She say I got her goin round in circles
Shawty just so fine

She say I got her goin round in circles
Just so I can make you mine

Baby girl I gotta thang for you, 
But I can't force myself to buy a rang for yu.
Shawty caught the love bug.
And love is a tough drug,
But it's for scrubs
We go round and round and round we go. 
Been there like the ship sank, 
Down we go.
Just to break up 
One day you gon wake up 
And understand that you just my side line
Baby 
And I know time flies baby 
But one day we can be together 
Lilike maybe 
But you don't gotta be in line 
Cuz you to fine 
No I ain't tryna wast yo time

She say I got her goin round in circles
And she ain't tryna wait in line

She say I got her goin round in circles
And all I do is waste her time

She say I got her goin round in circles
But shawty just so fine

She say I got her goin round in circles
Just so I can make you mine

I been to all typa place 
I seen all typa faces 
And you keep on sayin you wantsta be my lady 
That's crazy 
Goin thru all these mazes 
Until you tired of chasin 
An you say you wantsta have all of my babies 
That's crazy 
I may not be the man that you love 
Say she wants me to be her mista lova 
Want me to be the man that you leave 
But there's one thing that ya just don't get 
An that's this

And she said that she wanna get to know me betta and she said that she hopin we can grow togetha
But I don't think that me and you can go together so baby do what you think is betta

She say I got her goin round in circles
And she ain't tryna wait in line

She say I got her goin round in circles
And all I do is waste her time

She say I got her goin round in circles
But shawty just so fine

She say I got her goin round in circles
Just so I can make you mine
