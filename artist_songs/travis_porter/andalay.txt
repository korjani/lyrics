A, see me and these niggas ain't the same
I got chain on top of chain
These giusep’s, crazy shoe game
Take the whip, blow the brain
Hood stop, they know my name
Pull up, blue flame
Blunt up, uptight
See calls, see rain
Pussy niggas keep hating
They don't change a damn thing
Left pocket got a fisker
Right pocket, mus-tang
Why these niggas talkin' pistol?
They won't shoot it in the rain, Damn

Lord forgive me for my sin, bow my head and pray
All my niggas going in, shorty, no fugazy
Hundred-thousand to the dealer that was yesterday
Counting K, counting that skrilla, nigga, andalay

ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
We ship it out of town, they show up, andalay
ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
And if you got the cash I pull up, andalay

This a hundred dollar cup, this a thousand dollar bottle
This a 2014, this a brand new model
I'm in diamond every monday, I'm in low, counting money
Man I might just book ashanti, just to tell her that I want it
Got a pocket full of cash, got a lil' shorty shaking ass
Man, I'm geeked up, probably got them bitches on the molly
Got my nigga right beside me, he a rich nigga, too
I know some niggas that owe me money, better pay me 'fore I shoot
Blip

Lord forgive me for my sin, bow my head and pray
All my niggas going in, shorty, no fugazy
Hundred-thousand to the deala' that was yesterday
Counting K, counting that skrilla, nigga, andalay

ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
We ship it out of town, they show up, andalay
ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
And if you got the cash I pull up, andalay

I'm a pull up in a mini, probably catch me in a foreign
Windows tinted, bitches in it
And my young niggas crazy, they don't ever leave a witness
Take your girl out to eat, fucked her right in front of business
And my cousin got the pack, he will send it where you at
Nigga say he want some act, that gonna cost your ass a stack
Hold up, let me call him back, tell him, "Hurry up and send it"
Bow my head and pray the Lord cause He know a nigga sinning

Lord forgive me for my sin, bow my head and pray
All my niggas going in, shorty, no fugazy
Hundred-thousand to the killa' that was yesterday
Counting K, counting that skrilla, nigga, andalay

ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
We ship it out of town, they show up, andalay
ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
And if you got the cash I pull up, andalay
