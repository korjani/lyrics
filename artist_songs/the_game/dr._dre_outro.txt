[Dr. Dre:]
This nigga been shot, but you already know that
He went to jail recently and Monster Kody taught him
"This ain't no place for you, you see bein' locked up 24 hours a day
That shit ain't gangsta, you see bein' outside takin' care of your family
That's the most gangsta shit a nigga could ever do"
He said "The shit ideal for takin' em out the hood
Givin' em a chance to be some motherfuckin' body
Now that shit was gangsta"
