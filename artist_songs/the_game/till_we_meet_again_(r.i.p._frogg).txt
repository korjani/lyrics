[Intro:]
Rest in peace to my motherfuckin nephew Frogg
Niggas this fat rap nigga
Love nephew, see you when I get there
Meet me at the front door

R.I.P. Frogg

[Chorus:]
Livin on a day
Even though that I can't touch you
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
I will always love you
Only you're so far away

[Verse 1:]
It's a problem they don't see the block
Block block soo woop til them heaters pop
Damn, my nigga dead in his grave and I can't wear this chain no mo
It got me feelin like a slave so I gave it to his pops in his memory
Loadin up the Glock, takin shots of that Hennessey
Layin on this table, getting tatted
And don't worry about who get it 'cause we at em
That's on the block
I know you standin next to Pac
Throwin up the west side, polo down to the socks
And I'm selfish cause I want you here
But you gone so it's chronic smoke in the air
And you know bad ass got a hot head
So it's on til a motherfucker drop dead
And even though it won't bring you back
I'm sippin on Rose clan, just me and my strap
Watching as the cars pass

[Chorus:]
Livin on a day
(Watching as the cars pass)
Even though that I can't touch you
(Just watching as the cars pass)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
I will always love you
Only you're so far away

[Verse 2:]
Swear to God I ain't slept in 5 days thinkin bout the 7 kids that you left behind
While I'm swerving on this highway
Reminiscing bout the time I joked about your cap
And how you wore that polo hat
Handin off yo head, point it to the back
Same smile since you was 10
And King Frog had you on his shoulders
Yelling see the burnin through the trap
Time flies, now we chasin all these hood rats
West side, you a diamond rollin through the hood, up and down the block
Pocket full of cash, fresh J's on the gas
Hop in the 1-10, meet the homies in the lot
Following this upper club and bout all the Ciroc
And remember when I bought your first bottle of sprays
Always down for yo niggas so you gave it to D Shade
So I brought a couple mo bottles, gold bottles
How a young seater becomes another's role model
Til we meet again

[Chorus:]
Livin on a day
(Til we meet again)
Even though that I can't touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
I will always love you
Only you're so far away

[Verse 3:]
I was holdin on
Your funeral is jumped up
Cemetery flamed out, all the homies burnt up
Tryin not to shed a tear but I couldn't hold it
Your daddy took it like a G and everybody know it
I told yo mama yesterday I got er and I do
As long as they printin money and I'm bangin pyroo
If one of the kids needs something, niggas comin through
They don't just go for his, all the homie's kids too
And look how them niggas did you
Homie stretched out, retaliation is sketched out
And we at it to the day's end
Bustin on my enemies til it cave in
And to my brother face and my homie slim roo
You know I got this
And these going up, you got a hood full of riders
Laugh now, cry later, the sucker niggas that shut up
We part em, red see em using products
And then it's on

[Chorus:]
Livin on a day
(And then it's on)
Even though that I can't touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
I will always love you
Only you're so far away

[Interlude]

[Chorus:]
Livin on a day
(And then it's on)
Even though that I can't touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
Only you're so far away
I will always love you
Only you're so far away
