I got a bullet with your name on it
You 'bout to have a hoodie with a motherfucking stain on it
Dashboard with your brain on it
Motherfucking bitch, you worried bitch nigga tell yo mama put a frame on it

Know it's murder, if The Game on it
Irv Gotti with the flame on it
I'm in the coupe, know the roof and it smell like Mary Jane, don't it?
Balmain crew neck, [?] with the chain on it
Goddamn, I'm the motherfucking man
Tote drums like a motherfucking band
So fly, I don't know where to land
So fly, motherfucking Peter Pan
You put the city on your back like a motherfucking tat
Damn nigga, you can stand where I stand
You can eat where I eat
I got a house on the beach but I run these streets
100 grand every week
10 mil in the safe, so you know where I sleep
Put a pillow by the combo
Band arms like I'm Mutombo
Ears to the street like Dumbo
High school on El Segundo
So you ain't gotta ask where I'm from though
Hit the corner on Cedar, polo beater
Run up on a nigga like pronto
Run up on a nigga like Wingstop
Lemon pepper wings when the motherfucking beam hot
Got the molly, got the white and the lean locked
Selling dreams on my grandmama grandpop

I got a bullet with your name on it
You 'bout to have a hoodie with a motherfucking stain on it
Dashboard with your brain on it
I got a bullet with your name on it
Know it's murder, if The Game on it
Goddamn, I'm the motherfucking man
Got a bullet with your name on it
Know it's murder, if The Game on it
I got a bullet with your name on it
