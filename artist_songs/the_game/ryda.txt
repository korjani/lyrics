[The Game:]
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da
Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da-da
Keep the pistol on the side-da-da
In the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la
She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek
'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep
Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet

[Dej Loaf:]
I always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard
You know I parade on the side of you, baby
Yeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang

[The Game:]
Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine
Bricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game
40 in the Sti dash fuck around and be road kill
With the top down feelin like

[The Game + Dej Loaf:]
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida

[Dej Loaf:]
No whip now we in the Ray Roll Range
Keep it gangsta pricy, one of them cold things
Wit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya
Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em

[The Game:]
Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off, but I dont need it, tell me what I need

[Dej Loaf:]
You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drop ass for you
Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah
Eat the pussy like la-la-laaaa

[The Game:]
Why you gotta tell a nigga buinnes
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you til the helicopter come

[The Game + Dej Loaf:]

[The Game + Dej Loaf:]
One look and I got her
In corners in my Impala
(My ambitionz of a rida)
Slidin down that pole for a dollar, nada
Tell that girl Holla
(My ambitionz of a rida)
I done brought the Thug Life out her
Got her stuffin bircks in that Prada
(My ambitionz of a rida)
And she love when I'm inside her
And can't nobody divide us
