And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait, can't wait
I got a bitch named Soo and a bitch named Woo
And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait till I can fuck em' again, can't wait

My little bitch named Soo', that's my Woo
She like to play hide and seek inside my coupe
When I pull up, she like to hop out the roof
And I put that on my hood, I love eveything that she do

Bitch got bodies on her, yeah new dirty bitch

And inhale fire, ain't no in between

And I don't leave without her and a pocketful of change

I got a bitch named Soo, I got a bitch named Woo
And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait, can't wait
I got a bitch named Soo and a bitch named Woo
And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait till I can fuck em' again, can't wait
