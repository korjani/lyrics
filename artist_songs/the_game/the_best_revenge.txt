Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs

She bent over in that closet lookin' for them red bottoms
She know I like the pair with them spikes on
I mean that's all she rocket
She got that Louis rolled on, that thing satin
And you know that ass fat if I'm gon take the loss in this matin yea
Don't stop, let me hit it from the front
Don't stop, let me hit it from the back
Hit it till you cum, hit it till you run
Use my tongue and fuck up your act
Now she ain't goin' nowhere for a while
IPhone ringin'? That's ol' girl
Beat the pussy up, that's the hook right there
Bang on track no. 3 on that cold world
Never give a nigga problems
Got a nigga back like Sean Diddy Combs got Harlem
And she better than my niggas
It's like holdin' a nigga down
What's that? You call it

Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs
Those have forsake it cause you're smart and you're beautiful
Success, good friends
The best revenge
All my park has got bigger and I've never been hearin'
Let 'em say whatever they want, they just want slower digits
Success (success), good friends (good friends)
The best (the best) revenge (revenge)

Look at all them girls hatin'
Look at all them girls hatin'
Look at all them girls hatin' outside that club, in that line waitin'
Cause she can't be you, she can't be Nicki, she can't be Kim
And we over here sippin' that Ace while you over there man cause you sippin' that gin
How many shots do I take to get to your center?
Take 'er to the bathroom then I go in 'er
In 'er in 'er in 'er so far
I could see everything that she ate fo' dinner
Pop my car, hell yea, fuckin' righteous
Smart girl, she can give me brains all night
I'm a beat it up like a USC fight
Most time that I ever spent in 'er I liked
And a girl french, just al'ight
Keep fuck with them cause they ain't my type
Get them bags packed and meet me at the port
Grab the passport, I ain't tryna miss my flight

Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs
Those have forsake it cause you're smart and you're beautiful
Success, good friends
The best revenge
All my park has got bigger and I've never been hearin'
Let 'em say whatever they want, they just want slower digits
Success (success), good friends (good friends)
