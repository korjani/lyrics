[Intro:]
They say Henny make the world go 'round

[Verse 1:]
2Pac wouldn't been shit without his mama
Obama wouldn't be shit without his mama, and his baby mama
See my mama set me down when I was 12
She told me I was heaven while I always gave her hell
No role models, daddy in and out of jail
Caught up in the system where he trap us black males
Sippin' Henny as the world turn, close my eyes, see my mama face
I know she always kept me straight just like them graces
And even still, you gon' always will my black queen mama
Cause you never been no crack fiend mama
And even though you only son grew up to be a thug
You ain't never stopped showin' me love

[Hook - The Game & (Sonyae):]
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas

[Verse 2:]
When we was little ass kids, fall in the dirt
You call your mama now you grown 'bout to get murked
Screamin' for your mama when it's on, funeral home
There go your mama wish you brought your ass home and left the drama alone
I had my mama waitin' by that window
Comin' home 3 in the morning, smellin' like indo
And even though we had some long nights we was friends though
Got my name from yo mama playin' Nintendo, you kicked me out
But you gon' always be my black queen mama
I bought your house servin' crack fiends mama
And even though you only son grew up to be a thug
You ain't never stopped showin' me love

[Hook - The Game & (Sonyae):]
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas

[Verse 3:]
A man can't have a baby on his own
And even if that man leave, that mama stayin' strong
You know mama's baby, daddy's maybe, streets raise me
Granny save me, sweet Satan, what a lady
She carry you for 9 months
She got a baby in her stomach, she ain't cry once
You gon' always need your mama never loud front
When she get older, turn that favor when that time comes
And always remember she was there so we never needed health care
Too much pride so we ain't never been on welfare
And mama, before we leave this earth
My only wish is that I beat you to the dirt cause I know

[Hook - The Game & (Sonyae):]
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas
(Mama, mama, mama)
We ain't shit without our mamas
We ain't shit without our mamas

[Outro:]
This song is dedicated to Lynette Marie Baker
Momma, I love her
Everything we been through, we went through together
Me, you and my little sisters
Take this time out
Thank all the mothers in the world just for stayin' strong
And I wanna say R.I.P. Afeni
I know you're happy you with 'Pac now
I know he aight, he got his mama
