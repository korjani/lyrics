[dials phone - phone rings]

[Kim] Hello?
[Girl] Hello
Is this Lil' Kim?
[Kim] Who's this?
[Girl] Don't worry 'bout all that
I found your number in my man's pocket
[Kim] Well shit bitch!
Give it to him then!
No wonder the motherfucker hasn't call me yet!
Look at your fuckin' groupie ass
Stealin' numbers and shit
[Girl] Wha? Fuckin' bitch!
I'm gonna see your ass at the motherfucking concert

[Kim]
Does she do it like me?
Does she work that body?
Throw that ass like pu-pump-pump-pu-pump that hottie
Do she handle it like she got a deep throat?
I mean suck that cock 'til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X?
Try it with me and tell me who's the best
Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat?
Do she fuck your brains out 'til you fall asleep?

[1]
Bet you she don't fuck you
Like you know I fuck you
And I bet you she will never do, oh
All the things I'll do for you

Is she drop-dead fine?
Does she like it from behind?
Is she fly?
Do she got a style like mine?
Does she slurp it, rub it, jerk it, ride it?
Tell you how you feel when you inside it
You love me, and I know she know
Cause everytime I come around, she be like "let's go"
Girls know not to leave they man around me
I get my hands on 'em
He puttin' wedding bands on 'em

[Repeat 1]

I'm the queen of Rap, there is none higher
Did she tell you that?
The bitch is a liar
People spend doe to see me spit fire
And niggas give they life to be with me for one night
I let you come in me, while you stick it in the booty
Lick the nut off, then stick it back in the coot, see
I bet you she don't even know how to kiss
And I bet you ain't never been fucked like this

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

And I bet ya, and I bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
And I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
No, baby
