[DJ EZ-Dicc:]
Yeah, it's time to wake up
Wake up and cake up
It's 187.4 FM on your dial
The number 1 station via satellite, CD radio and your stereo
Broadcasting live from the left coast
The land of la la, movie stars, pimps, playas, hustlers and thirst traps
It's W Balls, the station that murders them all with platinum hits
And this is dedicated to the ladies who love giving that sloppy toppy
Go 'head and pull that foreskin back, hold on tight
It's the jack off hour, girl
You requested it and The Documentary 2 is in your ear
And I am the DJ that is gonna sock some soul to your ass
Not the DJ that can save your life
It's ya boy, Kane Dingaling, AKA the original black spiderman
About to shoot a rope down your throat, it's DJ EZ-Dicc
Killing you softly with intoxication and a song that's guaranteed to put some dip in your hip
Right now you're listening to the sweet melodic sounds of The Game and the homeboy Deion
So kick back, get your mind right, red cups in the air
Sip on some of that gin and juice like it ain't no thang
And puff on some of that LA Confidential strain, yeah

[Deion:]
Pouring up the gin and juice (gin and juice)
Got a nigga feeling loose (got a nigga feeling loose)
Can you roll this blunt for me (yeah, yeah)
I'm just tryna smoke this weed (smoke this weed)
I spend all my life intoxicated (intoxicated)
And the chronic on deck (on deck)
Till we spark that grade-A

And shout goes out to our Instagram thot Shanine from the CPT
Yeah, she swallowed the nation and she's in our winning circle and she qualifies for that Blood Money swag pack
That includes the Blood Money gear, that Brazilian, Malaysian bundle, one year's worth of free visits to Dr. Fixaflat, the ass doctor
She got two tickets in backstage passes to the winners' circle concert featuring YG, Ty Dolla $ign, Kendrick Lamar and starring The Game
And speaking of The Game, he gon' be stopping by the studio later on
But right about now, I'ma hit you off with another slapper off The Documentary 2
It's a DJ Quik produced joint so pop it and lock it
Right here on the station that fades them all, W-Balls
yeah that's that chronic
Don't stop sucking, girl

(Everybody's got to hear this shit
On W Balls! W Balls!)
