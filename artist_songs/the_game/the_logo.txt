Tell them hoes I go by Mr. Spades now
Lifestyle, Mele, MWSMG yea

I'm in this bitch gettin' money like vodo
Cincinnati snap back, new era logo
I'm the new era's logo, I'm the boss, I'm the shit
New Bentley truck, never south as a bitch
Getting' lost in the wind, Chevy traffic on the rims
Got my bitch in that Benz, doin' 90 on the 10
I got 99 problems, not a motherfuckin' friend
See my niggas beat my niggas, we gon ride it to the end
In the club, blowin' them racks cause that space never cheap
We got three bottles a piece and we all got pizzas
When it come to all this money we divide it like pizza
When it comes to fuckin' hoes we gon slide 'em like Visas
Bitch I'm 'bout my paper check and heat blows in Geneva
Puerto Rican in Geneva and she got Ferrari features
Shittin' on you peones, then dine by those neon
Use to run the rock and bass like Dian

I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo
Across the world, gettin' all this money
I can't get enough (Money Gang be the logo)
Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up

What you don't know is I be in that 4-door
And what you do know is I be in that hew blow
But what you should know is I be fuckin' shook hoes
In that cook oh anyway or any day
Twenty bottles of that Ace, twenty models in my face
Flew to Chicago for these J's
It was windy but hey
I ain't sleep outside from folks
I ain't sleep ouside for them tens
I'll sleep outside for the rest of my life if the rap shit don't work out al'ight?
No ice on the nigga
Your wife on a nigga
You don't like no nigga?
Let me put the red light on a nigga
Bad bitch from France, she gon put them spikes on a nigga
Then we in New York sittin' next to spike on the niggas
But I'm rootin' for the Clippers
Getting' sued tryna move for them strippers
Keep the tool and nigga ain't gon slip up
Jack the Ripper, nigga ain't gonna slip up
Slow down, takin' your hoes down
Nigga we in your town, spillin' in some more now
Money Gang got tracks and spas
Guess you could say we the new Mo Towns

I'm lookin' for a bad bitch and she know what I want
Red vone and you better bring a friend
Why fight it in the front and you know I gotta stunt
Fuck the line, girl you know we gettin' in

I shut it down in my side of town
Fuck your girl when you're not around
She in love with my bank roll
She like the way I make her go (uuu)
Move around the city with a chick like J Lo
Fuckin' with a boss, baby everything paid fo'

Money Gang, MG be the logo
It's Atlas, B dub S if you don't know, dog
You only live once, yo lo
So I'm at the bar, takin' shots to the head, Miguel Cotto
Wrist froze like a person's pose for a photo
Big dog yard, you ain't allowed in here, Toto
We don't lose, only move for that money
If it ain't about that money I don't move rocks
Phantom on cruise, engine on the hood
Heavenly white paint job
Hater face look like he smelled a stink bomb
(Look at it) Got me feelin' like a ball playa
I don't play ball but I ball like a star playa
I'm a star hater, you know how I do
Swag super stupid, got a low IQ
Bottles in the air like we don't got a care
If you do it like we do it, baby hawl it if you hear
