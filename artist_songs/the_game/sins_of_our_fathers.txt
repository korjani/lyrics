[Marsha Ambrosius:]
Sins of our fathers
Father, forgive me
And after all I gave you stole my name
And took away from me
Our founding fathers
What have you gave to me?
I've been the victim of a broken home
You stole away from me
Sins of our fathers
Sins of our fathers

[The Game:]
I could hit you with the "Yes master", [?]
Or I could close the box on your ass like cold pizza
Whips and chains, brain gone, mind in shackles
Cam Newton, a Black Panther hard to tackle
Mix the moonshine with the Snapple
The White House a plantation
But they're teachin' our kids it's a castle
Built by slaves, my guilt by trade, the maze
Lab rats pickin' cotton inside invisible cages
House nigga, he hate us more than the massa
Burn his own church and smile in the face of the pastor
The last days, drinkin' our own sweat in the field
Either kneel or you get your ass killed

[Marsha Ambrosius:]
Sins of our fathers
Father, forgive me
And after all I gave you stole my name
And took away from me
Our founding fathers
What have you gave to me?
I've been the victim of a broken home
You stole away from me
Sins of our fathers
Sins of our fathers

[The Game:]
They gave my great-great grandfather lashes 'cause he stole a fuckin' horse
Now 500 horsepower in my mothafuckin' Porsche
As I light my torch on this Mississippi porch
Let the Mississippi River shatter windows on my [?]
Corpses is, of course this is, genocide
I'm in the same church where little kids and women died
I can hear the voices, ropes around throats
Separated our families when they stacked us on them boats
Choke, as your legs shake you start to lose hope
Wishin' the branch would break, but nope
Soon as your neck snap, they start laughin' and takin' pictures
'Cause to them you ain't nothin' but a mothafuckin' nigga
500 years later, I'm in the club
Chain on my neck, Harriet Tubman on the dub
Ben Franklin on the hundred, Hamilton on the ten
Even in death, she still surrounded by white men
