40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupés, coupés
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty

I am from where the niggas say "What'd up Cuh?"
You can get your ass wet up by "One Blood?"
And I bet they just saw El Chapo
And you can get your noodles spilled right up in your taco
And you can get your taco turnt into some nachos
All over cheese my nigga
What's beef my nigga? Ridin' by slow mo
Bullet holes in Caine and Sharif my nigga!
Fuck peace my nigga! Cause every time we try that
We get smoked by police my nigga
I am bringing sheets my nigga
Went from being skinny and gettin' jacked for my Penny's to a beast my nigga

40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupés, coupés
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty

I want the zooms zooms and wam wams, bricks in the Trans Am
Shooters on first, second and third, that's a grand slam
These rap niggas Fruit Loops; Toucan Sam
When I say so, bloods rush like a handstand
And ain't with that old Death Row shit
Been bangin' since '94, I ain't never did no hoe shit
Type of nigga I am, empty out the whole clip
Call my YG's and have em' run through your whole shit
Who was before Kendrick, who was before Nip?
Middle of the Slauson, did my shit fighting four Crips
You win some and you lose some nigga
You break knuckles and you bruise some nigga, what?

40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupés, coupés
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty
