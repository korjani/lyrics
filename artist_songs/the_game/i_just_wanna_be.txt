[Introduction - King Marie:]
So, close
But so, far away

[Hook - King Marie:]
I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna give us
I just wanna be me, 
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be 
I just wanna be 
I just wanna be 

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Put on my Dre Beats when I don't wanna hear the world talkin'
The walls closing in, the studio feel like a coffin
But I resurrect myself every time like I'm Jesus
Rather walk on water in the streets niggas dying for Yeezy's
Niggas sleeping outside for them J's know how it feel to be homeless even if its just for a day
Some of us bow our heads down when we pray, some of us bow our heads down so you can miss us with a stray
I grew up with DeSean let that young nigga play
Turn to run a slant let the bullet fly Zimmerman's way
I did it Eminem's way, when I was sitting with Dre
It was Aftermath or die then, Busta told me ride in
Snoop told me if you a dragon go spit that fire then
Game of thrones, I made my home inside that lion's den
And all my enemies I don't know where to find them
But me I got like nine in

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Stat Quo:]
The son of Maya Angelou and Martin Luther
But my daddy was a crackhead, my mom was a booster
Born in the belly of Medusa with the killers and the three time losers
These cops pursue us, thug gangs recruit us, to carry on some torch, they were taught, would improve us
As the system maneuvers, they just feed us manure
They living in paradise, we shoot it out in the sewer
I call myself Stat to remind myself not to be a statistic
As the kush get twisted my consciousness get lifted
We party with devils, digging graves with dull shovels
Diamonds on my bezel my grind on some other level
I'm subtle but won't settle, all black clothes
They say Stat you too ghetto, my pen wrapped in turbans
My bombs, bass and treble
Fell asleep in hell, I woke up living my dreams
I'm a rebel

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - SAP:]
I just wanna be a
Dreamer, I see all these things with my eyes closed
Woke up to reality, actually in fly clothes
Life is such a gamble, I'm proof that the odds roll
So anything we planning we do it colossal
Hurt people that I know was dreamers, which means that just makes my grind meaner
Let me turn my rhymes into a time machine and remind the people
How dope these lines can be when you're tryna reach the higher league
You seem to bleed through the soul to the choir speakers
I am preaching, to the younger nigga I used to be
And usually it's just inspiration that you can use to be
Bigger than the world in a world where you are user free
But still you live off of so much more than what you used to see
But who the fuck am I kidding, this shit is even new to me (word)
I got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece of this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day
But I swear this the beginning, I be dreaming every day

[Hook]
