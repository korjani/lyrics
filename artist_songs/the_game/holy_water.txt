[Hook]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, I’m walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water

[Verse 1]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
’92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy’s drop got ‘em, couldn’t afford ‘em you shot ‘em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don’t pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J’s
The you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon’ die for em, they better be some number 4′s
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin’ on my car cause

My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water

Holy water, holy water

[Verse 2]
Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life’s mission
Trynna’ save her ass like trynna’ save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna’ fuck, that’s the reason you tip her
And all I’m sayin’ is a watch and a gold chain
Can’t make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that’s why her mouth wide
Openin’ up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin’ 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin’ pies
Switchin’ lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin’ her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin’ on the days I was rollin’ broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

[Hook]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water

Holy water, holy water
