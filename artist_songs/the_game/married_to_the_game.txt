[Verse 1 - Game:]
I do, I'm getting married in this motherfucker
See that black Ghost? It's getting scary in this motherfucker
Sittin' on a hill son, carryin' this motherfucker
Red guts, popped a cherry in this motherfucker
I got that White boy, Barry in this motherfucker
And I got Homes nigga, Larry in this motherfucker
See you on them cameras, Jason Terry in this motherfucker
If gay is happy, I'm Tyler Perry in this motherfucker
House in the water, need ferry to this motherfucker
And I got cheese, thinkin' dairy in this motherfucker
More gold bottles than you can carry in this motherfucker
Peach Ciroc, Red Berry in this motherfucker
Let me see you shake it for a real nigga
She gone think she in a fairy tale once that pill hit her
Even though she out of her mind, I'm a to deal with her
Might let Drizzy Drake, French, and Meek Mill hit her

[Hook - Sam Hook:]
I met her, fucked her, fell in love with her
Left but came back, still in love with her
She is married to the Game

[Verse 2 - French Montana:]
Married to the Game nigga
Got them Birds, Larry in this motherfucker
And you know we legendary in this motherfucker
Doors suicide, Hail Mary in this motherfucker
Montana, ask a motherfucker
Show you why I live you need a dictionary ass motherfucker
Yeah, niggas hating on this motherfucker
Got the glove on, Gary in this motherfucker
Delonte West, motherfucker
Fuckin' with Game in the west, like a motherfucker
Even though shorty crazy, might deal with her
Might like Drake, Game, Meek hit her, Montana

[Hook - Sam Hook]

[Verse 3 - DUBB:]
LA on my back, I'm tired of carryin' this motherfucker
Niggas chasin' racks, Tom & Jerry in this motherfucker
Long nose revolver, Dirty Harry in this motherfucker
Way a nigga drew, you'd think Carey this motherfucker
Game and French killed it but I'm buryin' this motherfucker
First off the label, January in this motherfucker, nigga
You get Shmurda'd in this motherfucker
At this park, get killed over a burger in this motherfucker
Get away car, a nigga swervin' in this motherfucker
Mom's kicked me out, a nigga servin' in this motherfucker
Beard and a chopper, need a turban in this motherfucker
Put you on Iceman, George Gervin in this motherfucker
Out of Cognac, I'm sippin' Bourban in this motherfucker
Enemies strippin' in black Surburbans in this motherfucker
Power steerin' gone, how I'm turnin in this motherfucker?
Intercepting hoes, Richard Sherman in this motherfucker

[Hook]
