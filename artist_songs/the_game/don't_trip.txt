[Intro - Dr. Dre:]
Damn, Will.I.am, my nigga. It's your boy Dre
Yo, I don't think people know that you know how to take it to the streets

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Check it out now, check it out now
Check it out, uh-huh
It's like that, yeah, it's like that now
It's like that, uh-huh, it's like that now
A black.45, I gotta put it on
That chrome Glock 9, I gotta put it on
That.38 special, I gotta put it on
Never leave the house without the teflon
Hop off the porch like, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus - will.I.am and Game:]
Ooh, that new bounce
New bounce, new bo don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me

[Verse 2 - Game:]
Nigga, don't trip
Don't trip, homie
Yeah, I'm the opposite of Crip, homie
You ain't even gotta ask, niggas know me
I make it rain like Tony, Toni, Tone!
Aventador to the corner store, I whip this hard
Compton God, watch em jump over cop cars
Yeah, I grew up to N.W.A., nigga
And my grannies whipping yay-yay, nigga

[Verse 3 - Ice Cube:]
Come on, don't trip, homie
Ice grew up around Crips, homie
Where you motherfuckers find this phony?
Acting hard, he's a tenderoni
The boulevard to the prison yard, I push this cart
Westside rolling, wherever you are
And I been coming up, and ain't none of ya'll niggas running up
Cause I'm quickdraw when I'm gunning up
Boy you know the sun ain't coming up
Layed that ass down
Tryna milk this cash cow
Face down, look at you now
Bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Dr. Dre:]
You know the deal greet a nigga on your knees bitch
You heard the talk around town I don't need shit, Compton
Deep water got em sea suck
Murder, murder shit and ain't nobody see shit
Bomb weed, palm tree, gold D shit
Who that nigga that said I wasn't gon be shit
Cocktail through the window with the indo
It's what this is we gon stress them innuendos
We do what we wanna when we want to
And we never hesitated to confront you
And we same shit as kids
It was normal to us, I might take you
But it might fuck around and haunt you
Shoulda come and see this shit
Give a fuck about no tours, nigga
I want you to come and be this shit
Ren, Cube, Yella, Dre and Eazy-E t**s shit
See how long it take your punk ass to leave this bitch
Compton

[Chorus - The Game:]
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip

[Verse 5 - The Game:]
Don't trip blood, I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my boogie jacket giving you the facts on

We was fighting over territory with the T Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

[Chorus - The Game:]
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip

[Verse 6 - The Game:]
Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say Game, why you always act a fool like that?
Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a ru like that
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They see like that, we be like that
We trip like that cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out

[Outro - Will.I.Am:]
When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know
I got it
When you see me
Congratulate a nigga don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas yep, true!
That's why I don't trip on these niggas
Would you?
Nigga is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep!
What happens when niggas unite and start making the moves
Don't trip
