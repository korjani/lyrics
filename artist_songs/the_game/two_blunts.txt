With the two blunts, I got two blunts
Two blunts I got two blunts
Light it up, go and light it up
One time for the Buddha
With the two blunts, I got two blunts

[Verse 1: The Game]
You know I'm faithful to the ganja
And I'm in love with marijuana, juana
I'm gettin' head when the sun up, sun up

Two blunts I got two blunts
Light it up, go and light it up
One time for the Buddha
With the two blunts, we got two blunts

You ain't got that pack, you gotta move on
Girl I got the fat, my shit too strong
Damn I don't smoke by the gram
I'ma roll up an eighth, take that straight to the face
And if you ain't goin' to hell what you do it for?
I'm tryna get you higher than you ever been before
I'm just at the crib chillin' with your bitch and

One time for the Buddha
With the two blunts, we got two blunts
Two blunts I got two blunts
Light it up, go and light it up
One time for the Buddha

[Bridge: Lorina Chia]
Two blunts, two blunts, two blunts
Won't you smoke with me
Got two blunts, two blunts, two blunts
Smoke with me
