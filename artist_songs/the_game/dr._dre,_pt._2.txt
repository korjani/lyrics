[Dr. Dre:]
In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back
