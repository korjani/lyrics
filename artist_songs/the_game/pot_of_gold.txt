[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.

[Verse 1:]
There's a mother out there right now,
About to have the next LeBron,
Searchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun,
They say death comes in threes, whose next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time,
Now I'm on a quest to find peace,
Still gotta carry my piece and soo-woo when it's reppin' time,
Ya'll don't understand, I'm misunderstood,
Give Interscope 2 more albums then I’m done for good,
Sold 10 million records ain't leave the hood,
It's a cold world everybody need a hood,
And everybody doin' time stay headstrong,
You still gotta chance to live,
Even though you're dead wrong.

[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa)
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I try to do good but I just can't be,
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me,
And ya'll should thank me,
But my haters busy tryna send me home early but you can't New Orleans Saint me.
I ain't a saint B, I ain't a god God,
I ain't an angel neither but I try hard ya'll,
I'm lightin' up for all my soldiers at war,
As I sit back and watch the ashes on my cigar fall,
Wayne just came home, and tip back on the yard dog,
Guess Pujols ain't the only one playin’ hard ball.

[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.

[Chris Brown:]
See the thing about all of us is
You never know just what we bout

All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.
