[Hook:]
The other day I had breakfast with Al Pacino (politicking)
Told him I wish he was in casino (probably checking)
Breathe
Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino (hood nigga)
Eating breakfast with Al Pacino was good nigga
Please

[Verse 1:]
My life a movie directed by Tarantino, my Lambo lounging the kimo
I'm at that fork in the road like a torturous Hov
I ain't wanna sell blow, I was forced to that stow
See, I was forced to be hard, without multiple goals
So I multiplied and magnified that coke, till I was satisfied
Took oath in my last supply, I kept my tenants classified
My momma ain't know nah
My daddy and my uncles gave me bundles,
Put it on bees I made it bumble
Bred 11's, thou should not stumble
In bed by eleven, that's where she thought but I'm in a jungle,
Sayin no this ain't no training day
I'm on that track, but I put them trains away
And my enemies on this train today
My dreams is where them bangers lay
The sky is where my fingers stay
Unless I bring the K, and choppers making rainy day
Niggas praying to Yezus
Remember before he was famous, yeah!
A younger game would say

[Verse 2:]
And if you must know, nobody's perfect
We screw up, we make mistakes
Have heart breaks, go through hard times
But you need to know that's life
The world ain't full of assholes
But they strategically play
So that you could come across one every day
You know what I'm saying?
Sometimes things that happen in life are not part of a plan
But when that happens, don't give up on your dreams!
Just find another way to reach em,
Just give your food for thought, ladies and gentleman
Worrying won't stop the bad from happening
But it will stop the good from being a joy
Yes sir!
