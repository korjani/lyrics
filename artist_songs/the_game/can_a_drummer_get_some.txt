[Game] 
Boom, guess who stepped in the room 
Dressed in black diamonds like a fucking monsoon 
Back from the dead but they never found my killer 
So I jumped up out this rave like Michael Jackson in thriller 
Iller than most emcee's cause I be killin' 'em 
Most emcee's turn into ghost emcee's 
Yeah, give a drummer some 
If 32 seville when that all black Hummer run 
Face off, Nicholas Cage with a gauge 
I'm famous for killin' rappers, my style, grenade 
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon 
The beats are filet mignon without the A1. 
Who walk like a pitbull, You? who bitch please 
I ate your favorite rapper's heart out with a 16 
Didn't hit the switch on something with fiends 
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, that's Swizz Cheese!

[Lil Wayne] 
Bang, guess who checked in the game 
Smoke in the air like LeBron James 
Running this shit like he run game 
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames 
She on Wayne, but she ain't what I be on 
I'm Leon, I pee on you pee-on's for eon's 
I'm in my prime like Deion 
I'mma shine like neon 
I'm a Lion like Leon 
But I'm 'bout to go off, cause that is all I know of 
I don't have to show y'all, I'd rather show off 
Yeah, Travis on the Drums 
Travis on the beat 
Wayne got the smoke and Game got the heat 
Weezy F I'm an F'ing star 
Haha, get it? I'm an FN star 
Ha, and it's the Rock you bastards 
If I'm the rockstar, will rock you bastards

[Rick Ross] 
Tupac and Juice riding [?] on the loose 
King James round my neck, haters wish it was a noose 
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe 
Kush out the jar, car smellin' like duke 
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I'm a goof 
Designer underwear she knows I'm a goose 
Got the wide body I'm a fat muthafucker 
In Swahili I'm screaming "stack muthafucker" 
Ya homie won't stop until I decide to 
Until then I'm making rollie's for the homies to ride to 
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know 
Bitch I'mma boss, best foots on the blow 
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front 
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt 
Being Savage where I'm from, Girls manage from the jump 
Don't trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so...
