[Lloyd:]
Let's ride...

[Hook: Lloyd]
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, that's where we gonna go
I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

[Verse 1: Game]
She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she working with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
I'll handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Every time we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore
Next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring...

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Verse 2: Game]
Soon as them butterfly doors go up on the Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that YSL, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it: might as well
Have her own reality show: no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
Heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
We on... and I ain't even gotta ask twice
Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price - damn!
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun...
