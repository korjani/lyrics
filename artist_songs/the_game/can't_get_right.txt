[Verse 1: Game]
I bumped Ether, bumped Takeover
Seein' Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop's makeover
And that very day you knew niggas was born
Tyler the Creators, Drake, J. Coles, and Big Seans
Time for the world to pay homage
Bow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit
Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit
I used to wanna be a little Hov
Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
Made a little money, bought me a little Rov'
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now
Thinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill
Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

[Verse 2: Game]
Dre promised me records, I never got 'em
That's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real
Dre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin' the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, Em, 50
Me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360
Plus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries
I ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me
Fuck 'em all

[Hook]

[Break: K. Roosevelt]
See I been spendin' these late nights
Oo, girls I never seen gettin'
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With 'em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That's the way the story goes
But now, I can't feel my heart
But I just keep ridin', ridin'
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

[Hook]
