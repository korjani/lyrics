[Hook:]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck fed now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fucking body nigga

Gansters, this is how we roll
Jesus Piece, and it's out of gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost, and it's adios

Who the fuck scared now?
Who the fuck scared now?

[Verse 1:]
Chased that nigga down, put him on worldstar
Bitch nigga got away, in his girl's car
Put that pussy on the net like a pornstar
Another weenie with bread, he a corndog
Put 3 holes in his head, like a bowling ball
I'm out the gutter switching lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds, cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the murder dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the desert eagle and
I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn
Specialize in the murder game
Documentary shit, back to Hurricane
Now tell a nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat, I'll clap niggas
This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga
What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie dog?
I ain't no snitch but if I did it ain't no biggie dog
Cause that's Biggie dog
All that's coming out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as being 50's dog
But I got tired of being 50's dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebrating, label on my dick hard
Interscope asking "would I take 50's call"
Hello? Put up 10 mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas
G-Unit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All these niggas claiming they OG, my young boys will murder them
Cold shooters, that 16, and they ain't ever even heard of them
I slide through, I get a bird of them
And they drive through, and they serving them
These niggas talking that beef shit, I put bread on it, no burger bun
We walk up in this bitch like "what?"
Rollie on my wrist lights up
Told these niggas "can't do it like us"
Ciroc boy, and I do it like Puff
With 100 bottles, 100 models
No twitter, we come to follow
Straight shots and no Moscato
I fuck them hoes, don't give a fuck bout em
Now tell me who's scared now?
Shots fired, man down
Dead bodies get found
That chopper clip spits rounds
And real niggas get murdered
Top dogs get it first
He came to me in that Benz
And he left from here in a hearse
Woah!

[Hook]
