[Verse 1: The Game]
I was forced to be a gang banger
On the cover of The Source with my chain hanging
That was '05 still Fuck Benzino
Riding through the city with them twin benzitos
Stepping on C-Notes, rolling red dice like casinos
Throwing 'tron shots like free-throws
Tell Judas I'm alive and well
Will I be crucified only time will tell until then I'm thugging
Spend my money on whatever
Running through this cheddar as long as my crew together
Pop Ace, pop tags, pop hammers
"Thug life" I put that on Pac's bandana
Los Angeles King, tell my niggas in the Bing
I blacked out the card and minimized the bling
Updated the Ghost, went Nas on the wig cap
And made wifey ring rocky ASAP, yea
(aha, let's go)

[Hook: Sam Hook]
This right here reminds me of when
The playas had the the dope so the girls brought their friends
And every single night we did it again
We had a good time, we had a good time
In the city

[Verse 2: Fred the Godson]
I was forced to be a force
Diamonds in my cross, the cost for me to floss
Got me exhausted
Exhaust that's on the Porsche, got me wide awake
Just make sure that my wallets caked while I wait
The coupe drop well
Got banana clips in the Big Apple, homie, fruit cocktail
Eh Game what it look like
I got the shorty and I'm playing with her chess (chest) on the corner, look like a rook right?
The city that never sleeps
We ain't talking bout money, we prolly will never speak
Lobby within a week, we generated revenue
Old heads put me on the things that I never knew
I'm big in New York word to my moms baby
And its hard to be the Giant just ask Tom Brady
That's why they pay me
When you ask who the best right now that's why they say me
Fred in the game peace
