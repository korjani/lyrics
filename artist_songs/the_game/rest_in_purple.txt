[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Why everybody got to to die so damn soon?
All these legends dying, God got to be running out of room
How he die? Don't nobody even know yet
All I know is I ain't ready to go yet
So I jump in that purple Lambo
Throw in that Bryson Tiller, Rambo
After that its Purple Rain, its Purple Rain
Man its Purple Rain on repeat
First Michael Jackson, then Whitney Houston
Now Prince, its a 3 peat
And if you see me in traffic its three beeps
And you know what's crazy? He was 57 with no kids
So I'm a hug mine cause a nigga probably only got 21 more years to live
21 more years to breathe
21 more years to feel the sun rays
To fill collection pots up on Sundays
And 21 more years to wake my kids up on Monday
We all die one day
Everybody gotta go someday
Natural causes or the gun play
Since we was born we all been had it one way
Ain't no time to be asking God why
And ain't no tears man I'm a let the doves cry

[Chorus - Lorine Chia:]
Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gong die
Maybe, maybe I'm just like
Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gong die
Maybe, maybe I'm just like
Maybe I'm just like
Maybe I'm just like
I see purple in the sky

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
Feeling purple, might pour some lean today
When God take a star, he make a star, yeah go on, dream today
In the red Corvette getting cream with the top down
Diamonds and pearls all around your neck and that rain purple when it drop down
Yeah darling Nikki, I think its our time
I want to be your lover, then we gon party like it's 1999
Get used to the pop life, we gon live it
Celebrate it like Pac's life, yeah who else with' it?
I remember watching Purple Rain when I was 5
My mom and dad fought the same way as yours, I ain't understand why
Ain't nobody perfect, ain't none of us the same
We all wanna leave the past behind us, sometimes we change our names
Well we can't change who we are, can't take the pain away
So live your life and love your family, don't take the world in vain
I'm a light one in your memory, cause the time has come
The world lost a legend, but he up there with his son
So I'm a pour up in your memory, cause the time has come
The world lost a legend, but he up there with his son

[Bridge - Lorine Chia:]
Up there with his son
Cause you're up there with your son

[Chorus]

[Outro - Lorine Chia:]
Purple in the sky
Makes me wanna, cry
Purple rain in your eyes
I see you up there, shine
You shine
With the sun you shine
Purple rain
When it rains purple the sun will shine
When it rains purple the sun will shine
When it rains purple the sun will shine
