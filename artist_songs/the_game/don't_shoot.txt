[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown and all the young soldiers out there
God help us

[Hook: TGT]
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwin up our hands don't let them shoot us
Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

[Verse 1: Game]
Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying stop the riots, we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, thought I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' bout Ciroc
I'm talking bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, 'I'm a Boss!'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lot of rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed, and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown? Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up, and don't you ever let them silence you
Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Ay yo Game, I had a crib out there, I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together, use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting, paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Holl'in' "Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police"

[Verse 7: Wale]
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing?
I’m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you ice challenge
Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt, so you just flexing then
Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all?
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart

[Bridge: TGT, King Pharaoh (Swizz Beatz)]
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am i supposed to do?
(Rest in peace to Mike Brown)
Where does it end?
(And all the other warring soldiers)
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?
(That will not be on the news or televised, ah)
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
(As we lead in peace)

[Verse 8: Swizz Beatz]
Martin Luther King had a dream!
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, armageddon right here
Right now, not on TV, but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice, yeah, we need justice here

[Verse 9: Curren$y]
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done, the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried

[Verse 10: Problem]
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived!
And who cares who ain't on our side cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like "We gotta do something"
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry, I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage, oh lord it's

[Hook]

[Outro: Game]
Stand up
