Look momma, I'm a chiefer, smoking on a reefer
I know you say you can't suck dick but I'm a teach ya
Bad lil bitch, yea I think that I'm a keep 'er
And she can't miss school so I fuck 'er on the bleacher
Got the models on deck, got them hoes in check
All these bitches know my name so my pull gettin' wet
I'll be rollin' rollin' rollin', off that potion we be bongin'
We be smokin', we be joinin' till they keep their party goin'
I'll be high, I'll be low, you try to row a bitch, let's go
If you did not put men on my weed then you can hit my jawn

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)

And all bitched branded
Tatted on the pussy, Jordan's and some spandex
Rolling up the cookie, please understand that she tryna fuck me but I'm a make 'er fuck my man now
Poppin' bottles like new year's eve and we standin' on the couch screamin' pussy money weed
In the club blowin' trees so these bitches wanna leave
And she ain't even trippin', daddy spendin' on her weed
Yea, and all my bitches they exotic
It's a party in her mouth and I'm her nuts so I'm invited
I will suck it, I will bite it, I will fucking start a riot
Got that cush in my pocket and I'm selling like a parent ah
Fuck, it's Miley Cyrus
Who the fuck is Miley Cyrus?
It's a party at the crib and it's private

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)

Ah, that's all I know about in this lifestyle
Put a dollar on a pussy and I wipe it down
Cool motherfuckaz, we don't tolerate clowns
We in this young life, care less, smoke rounds
Below homie Steve I hang 'er with a pou'
The bed call me Game, hold that shit down
I'm 'bout to get this motherfucka game a new song
Fuckin' relief, they don't know I'm with the fam
Ridin' 'round in my city
Smoked out I'm driftin'
Everybody, brother, sister, cousins chases fuckin' bailin'
That bitch fuckin', she guilty
I ride that and get filthy
We hop by so get liftin'
I smoke strong, that shit will be a Simpsons boy
And young boys get offended boy
Me, I'm just handlin' this grown man Dennis boy

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)
