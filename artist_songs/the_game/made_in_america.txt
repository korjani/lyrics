[Marcus Blvck:]
Started with a dollar and a dream
Sorta like Jordan getting cut from the team
Sorta like Dre 'fore he met Jimmy Iovine
I was lost out here, real niggas know what I mean
I said I started with a dollar and a dream
Sorta Jordan when he won his first ring
Sorta like Dre with the headphone thing
You could be whatever you want nigga, we all kings

I had a dream last night, I was rich Porter
Then I had a dream I had a bitch like Kim Porter
Then I had a dream I had bricks like transporter
Change my life like Steph Curry in the fourth quarter
What if you drove by a playground and witness 
Michael Jordan taking off for his first dunk, bet you wish you had your camcorder
That's the type of shit I'm made of
That's the type of shit I'm made of
Fourteen carat goldو Raekwon first album
Nothing but a G thang like when Dre met Calvin
That's the type of shit I'm made of
That's the type of shit I'm made of

Yeah, Yeah
Ay, wherever Nas is in the world he gon' fuck with this
Waddup, God
Queensbridge just like Compton, dog
In Inglewood niggas just like Yonkers, y'all
Where them Angels at?
(singing)
Sing it for me one more time
(more singing)
While I pretend to sniff this line

I used to wanna be Eazy
Then I realized it wasn't that easy
I used to wish that I was 2Pac
Then I realized that might get you shot
Figured I just gonna be myself though
Niggas hate me, Documentary on they shelf though
In this Impala, old school like some shell toes
Had a fake gold chain, but don't nobody else knows
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
Snitchin' on my homeboy, gossipin' bout old boys
Keep buyin' them Ferraris cause I grew up with no toys
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
I'm just trying to get my weight up
I'm just trying to get my weight up
Hol' on, I'm just tryin' to get my weight up
Big Homies drivin' by, tellin' me to stay up
How the fuck I'm 'posed to stay up?
When this weed got me feelin' like [?] bruh
I just seen Mac Dre bruh and the Jacka
Is we up in the Bay bruh?
Record my demo, something that I wish I could do again
I'm with that old shit, pulled up in my newer Benz
I went from JT the Bigga Figga to Biggie
We all make mistakes look what happened to me and 50
