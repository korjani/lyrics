[Intro - The Game:]
Cool and Dre

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
We was fucking all night, she ain't complain one time
Know that pussy swole up, but she said that it was fine
So I dove in it
Right stroke, left stroke, dick swole in it
No other dick can fit, left a dick mould in it
I make the pussy say, Aah cause it's no limit
Put my key in her garage, put the whole Rolls in it
Wraith, love the way you give a nigga face
Love the way that bitch say, Trey, Trey

[Chorus - Trey Songz:]
You know I'm a cold nigga
Pussy got me high, but she keep it on the low, nigga
Inspiration to the broke niggas
Middle finger to the gold-diggers
Give it to her like, Aah
About my business, baby, bet I put your ass to work
Then once I hit it, baby, I'm a make that pussy squirt
And I know your Trey bitch, but it's okay for me to flirt, let's go

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
Two cups, XO, one Wraith
Two seats, your face, my lap, baby
You gotta stay away from niggas that be on
I just wanna fuck, then I pro'ly leave you lone
Get back to this pimp shit that I'm on
Three bitches at a time, let em all blow my mind
And I'm a make that pussy mine
I be staring at the pussy like, Damn, that pussy fine
I ain't looking at your face til it's running down your make-up

[Pre-hook - The Game:]
I'm a do it to you, I'm a do it to you
Ass down, face up, I can't be faithful, no, I can't be loyal
If you looking for commitment, then this dick ain't for you
But you know for sure

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - The Game:]
Plus I got more bitches than this nigga do
More hoes than August and it's only July
And why would dude lie? More hoes than Chris
More hoes than R. Kelly, I put that on my piss
And, no, it ain't a diss if I ain't talking bout Karrueche
I put this Roman candle all in your coochie
She acting bougie, but she ride it like a hoopty
And if you come around, you already know that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
