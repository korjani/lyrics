[Sway:] Yeah, sometimes it’s best to leave the past in the past, but ya’ll was such a good team man, why don’t you tell me?

[Game:] Yeah. So basically, Fifty was on Hot 97 and shit, with Olivia, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck and shit doing an interview, and that’s the time I was kicked out of G-Unit and that was news to me and shit cuz, you know, that shit was uhh like I don’t know that shit just caught a nigga off guard. And I think he was kinda hot cause I did an interview with Funk Flex a few days before that where I was talking about, you know, his beef with Fat Joe and, and Nas and The Lox and shit. And I was like, you know, I grew up, you know what I’m saying, on Nas and shit, and I wrote you know what I’m saying, I fuck with The Lox and shit, and Joe always showed me love when I come to New York. So I was like, you know, shit.. I mean, I can’t just stop fucking with niggas I’ve been listening to my whole life cuz this nigga mad at them niggas for the time being. So, uhm, he was hot, but anyway, them niggas on the radio, I got hot, so you know at that time, I was in New York with 70 bloods nigga, so we went to the radio station and shit, hopped in a bunch of yellow cabs and shit, hopped out the motherfuckers and we walked up to Hot 97 before we could get to the door G-Unit security was already coming out and shit. So them niggas pull out guns, so my little nigga Peanut pull out a gun and start bustin' shots in the air. So them niggas start bustin' shots, we start bustin' shots, and niggas runnin in the snow but we got em from converse and them niggas start slipping and fallin you know what I’m saying, and then, fucking I think Jers got hit, Peanut got hit (Yo I think they shot Peanut blood) and Jers thought he was hit cause we hopped in the mo'fuckin Suburban and shit, and Jers had fuckin bulletholes in his North Face and shit, he was mo'fuckin whining and shit. Nigga I’m shot, Nigga I’m shot, and I’m like Nigga you ain’t shot you just got holes in ya jacket.
