Scooping up Chris and I'm hitting the freeway

Got a couple hoes home with no clothes on
Cause they roll on us, let's twerk
Now we hotboxin' that Ghost, Ace all in that do'

Smoke good, fuck good, eat good, steakcap
She said backwoods, kill swishers, you eat take out
Yeah, but I love fucking them redbones
She country thick and that hair long, that pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong, her mamma tall, So her legs long
She went to college and got her masters, now she bringing that bread home

[Lil Wayne:]
I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm goin' at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration
