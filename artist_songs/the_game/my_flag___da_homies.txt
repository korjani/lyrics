[My Flag]

[The Game:]
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging who you beefing with?

[The Game:]
I Know your baby never hurt nobody
But he got his ass smoked at that Mustard party
OG Blood, everybody know me when I came in with the little homies, Skeme!

[Skeme:]
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
That nigga duke just moved an ounce of yayo
And you know I keep gunners on the payroll
I even fucked with Mitchy Slick down in Daygo
Young General these niggas gotta spray for
You fuck around and catch 20 out this Range Ro'
Mane that beef shit is what a nigga made for
I open fire on her open mouth, case closed
Came in this bitch with Chuck Taylor's screaming fuck haters
Bad bitch I'ma fuck later, tryna touch paper
In a 6 tray rag going brazy up the ave
What I'm drinking got me thinking, nigga maybe I should iron out my -

[Jay 305:]
It's anybody killa, that's for anybody nigga
Mainline, waistside, westside nigga
Fuck peace, this for Crenshaw kings
Sockin' out niggas, tall as Yao Ming
Lowkey is on drop, give a fuck bout whatcho mama
When it's on, it's on, pop it like a bottle of patron
Then lay back with a bitch, man this is westside Jay 3-0 fifth
No gimmicks, God damn

[Mitchy Slick:]
I won't stop being a blood to gangland
To my dope then kicked in locked up in a strange land
So when they be like, "Slick, why we ain't see you on TV or nothin'?"
Shit, I'm still tryin' get off the gang injunction
Cause when it come to this been, I'm a monster to your leaf
You can do a whole damu documentary on just me
Call it "The Life of a Hundred Percent Real Whooper"
They did it for the grams, moves and the hush
Yeah Dat

[Joe Moses:]
I put the woop in the woop like my DLB's
All I know is VNG's and FTB's
I ran fades back to back, that's on STB
And if you claimin' you a blood, shit, you better know me
Big homie gave me a gun and said "It better be empty"
I was eleven years old with a motha'fuckin' fifty
I got love for certain niggas, I've been doing this since knee high Nehi
And you ain't a real blood if you didn't bang at the beehive

[RJ:]
Westside AM, back in a straight jacket
Mister LA back, free my A track
Middle of July, I'm just tryin' bring a Maybach
Whole city riding, I ain't even did a Dre track
Nigga this Athens, Miller gang mad
So east coast niggas be like "Cuh, you crackin'."
Niggas ain't goin' hard, as you should stop rappin'
I'ma be the street rider till the casket
