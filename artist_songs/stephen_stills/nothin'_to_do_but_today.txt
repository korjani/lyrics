Been on the road too long
Most of these changes should be past and gone
Clarify my position
Must be some kind of fool, I'm a musician

I got nothin' to do but today

Already on my way
Goodbye, I can't stop to say
Just quietly slipped away
Lose myself, it's the only way

I got nothin' to do but today

You think I'm not myself
You're confusing me with somebody else
I'm not so easily deceived
I am a blues man, I know when to leave

I got nothin' to do but today
Oh, like today
Oh, but today
