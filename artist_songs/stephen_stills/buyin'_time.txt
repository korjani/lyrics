Unless you believe in magic
There ain't much left you can be
A skeptic or a fool
Have you been watching your TV

Incredible is all I think of
Did I really see
Wordless faces double talkin'
A runnin' it down to me

About buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
And ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time, yeah

People goin' hungry
Ain't no jobs, they're in the street
Nobody's got no answer
They're just staring at their feet

Ain't no way about it
Things are lookin' pretty bleak
And everybody's scufflin' hard
Tryin' to make ends meet

We're just buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time, yeah

It happened once before, you know in 1932
But now there's so many more of us
There's something we gotta do

Something radical, something different
Got to hit on something new
America, the dream is lost
And it's killin' me and you

We're buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time

We're just buyin' time
