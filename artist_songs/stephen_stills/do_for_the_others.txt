Round, round, up and down
All along the lonely town
See him sinkin' low
Doesn't see the joy there is to know

And he cries from the misery
And he lies singin' harmony
She is gone there is no tomorrow
It is done so now he must borrow
The life of his brothers and living in sorrow
Must do for the others

A chill wind hits his face
Was that a tear I thought I saw a trace?
Loving people everywhere
Where is she? She is not there

And he cries from the misery
And he lies singin' harmony
She is gone there is no tomorrow
It is done so now he must borrow
The life of his brothers and living in sorrow
Must do for the others
