Ain't no thing
I got to say to you
Ain't no game
That I'm tryin' tryin' to run on you

I have fantasies about you
In the middle of the night
I could not live without you
If we ever got it right
One thing I know for sure
You ain't had no man that's yours
Ever do right by you

When you came
Into my life I was in trouble too
Were no flame
But to give up love ain't worth
These blues

I was driving myself crazy
I was wasted I was down
Weren't no time for being lazy
Pleasin' everybody round
Had some trip I had to deal with
Weren't no love that I could feel it
Ever get right by you

It's so strange
Hey hey hey little girl
What I've been through
Time for a big change
General overhaul of your
Attitude

All this misery and this cryin'
Ain't no knowin' what to do
You got circuitry that's fryin' all
This worryin' about you
Need a man knows how to fight
Get it over, get it right
Right right right by you
