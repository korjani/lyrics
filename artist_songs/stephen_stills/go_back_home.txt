Think I'll go back home
Think I'll go back home
Think I'll go back home

Back where I belong
Think I'll go back home

Nothin' for me here
Nothin' for me here, child, no there ain't
Nothin' for me here

People trapped by fear
And you can't get near

Lived with you I felt
Lived with you I felt, child
Lived with you I felt

I was by myself
I was someone else

Babe, come home with me
Babe, come home with me now
Babe, come home with me

And I'll make you see
Yes, I'm gonna set you free

When I woke up this morning
I found that I was alone, yeah
Till I called your number
They told me there's no one home again

Well, baby, what does it mean?
Is it like it seems?
