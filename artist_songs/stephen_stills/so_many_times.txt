So many times I've been fooling myself
It's a hard hand to play falls on nobody else
Those in the city reaching out to grab hold
Of something they've only heard about and never been shown

Who do you turn to and what do you say?
When she's got the power and she's got the way?
Does it matter at all who survives and who falls
When we live under darkness and hide behind walls?

Why would anyone even try to hold sway
Over somebody else in such a small way?
Where are the answers to the problems we face?
Who would teach us about sharing and living in grace?

Who do you turn to and what do you say?
When she's got the power and she's got the way?
Does it matter at all who survives and who falls
When we live under darkness and hide behind walls?
