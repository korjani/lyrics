Sometimes I think of the person I was
I really don't know him at all he was lost
Someone hurt he had to hide
Inside a shell every song was a cry

Por eso ahora ya yo no vuelvo a querer

Now I am somebody else and I know
It's not up to me whether I open or close
Someone has come to me she reaches for me
She didn't think twice when I gave her the key

Por eso ahora ya yo vuelvo a querer

I got no words left there's nothing to say
I was reborn on the Champs D'Elysee
Someone to listen somebody to share
I fell in love this time someone was there
To catch me
And I know it's not a dream
And we know who we are, who is we
And we're together
