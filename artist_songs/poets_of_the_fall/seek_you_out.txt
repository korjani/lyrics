Never said you'd promise anything 
Never told to trust you blindly 
Never thought you'd hurt me either 

Never had a chance 
Now ain't that so 
Never should've wept 
When you let go 
Never thought 
You'd push me away 

Sad as it may be 
I'm glad it's over finally 
Speaks volumes of me 
When letting go is never easy 

So I'll seek you out 
Just to find myself 
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later 
I hear you out 
Till I hear myself 
Hear myself in you 

Never knew if we were really true 
Never thought I'd ever get to you 
Never thought I'd end up like this 

Never was I stronger than I'm now 
Never felt this much a fool somehow 
Never had much thought for myself 

Sad as it may be 
I'm glad it's over finally 
Speaks volumes of me 
When letting go is never easy 

So I'll seek you out 
Just to find myself 
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later 
I hear you out 
Till I hear myself 
Hear myself in you 

Never knew if we were really true 
Never thought I'd ever get to you 
Never thought I'd end up like this 

Never said you'd promise anything 
Never told to trust you blindly 
Never thought you'd hurt me either
