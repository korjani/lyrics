Gotta get a hold of myself
I see them gathering around
And they need me to do their will

It's like I'm standing again
On the same window sill
Am I happy on the pill

If I wanna be the man
Should I open my wrist again
Would that make it excellent, yeah
If I wanna be the one
Should I book me an interview
To get an audition

Save me
I'm my own worst enemy
Running headlong to the wall cos I want my freebie
Save me
You're the only out I see
N' I need your love the most when I least deserve it

Gotta get a shot of something
Before I'll enter the ring
Gimme just a minute, just a minute

Did I really ask for all this
Did I really cut open the goose
Just to lose what's in it

If I wanna be the man
Should I open my wrist again
To find the way in
Yeah, if I wanna be the one
I'll need to get me that interview
To get that audition

Looking at myself in the mirror
Funny I should see only headlines and ads with my name
I was told I'd see my ally
So who are these skeletons with guns taking aim

Save me, save me...
