I’m just looking to live to learn how to live
Slowly staring to see it’s me I will need to forgive
Cuz it seems like I’m stuck in-between what I know
I want a kid, I know now
With too many choices of which way to go
Insight's a no show

I don’t need a miracle
I’m much more predictable
I just need you to show me this life
And if you ain’t too critical
We could be something beautiful
I just need you to show me this life (Take me home tonight)
Just a fantasy away
Your naked love laid next to me
My ecstasy

If I can’t decide to offer my choice
Does it mean I’m replacing the raise in your beautiful voice?
So every time you would tell me a lie, I could happily take it
Before our relations would endly flow by, I wouldn’t even fake it

I don’t need a miracle
I’m much more predictable
I just need you to show me this life
And if you ain’t too critical
We could be something beautiful
I just need you to show me this life (Take me home tonight)
Just a fantasy away
Your naked love laid next to me
My ecstasy

I thought I'd see it for myself
But this life ain’t, it ain’t for me alone
And here I thought I could keep it for myself
But you can slice the light right off my sun
With your razorblade caress of love

I don’t need a miracle
I’m much more predictable
I just need you to show me this life
And if you ain’t too critical
We could be something beautiful
I just need you to show me this life (Take me home tonight)
Just a fantasy away
Your naked love laid next to me
You’re just a fantasy away
Your naked love laid next to me
My ecstasy
