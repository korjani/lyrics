Is this really how quickly it goes away?
I can’t feel my emotions arrive today

Cuz I still love how you say my name
I still taste you kissing my pain away
Still see your tears through the rain
These burning sensations sustain
Feel the distance, bring us closer
Water would cool and soothe my pain
We can touch now
Just hold on now
Bridges would never burn again

I’ve seen this yearning take on a frightening form
The memory of you will make sure my past lingers on

And I still love how you say my name
I still taste you kissing my pain away
Still see your tears through the rain
These burning sensations sustain

Feel the distance, bring us closer
Water would cool and soothe my pain
We can touch now
Just hold on now
Bridges would never burn again

Don’t you worry
There’ll be a time when our hearts beat the same
Let life carry
Across the distance I still see your flame
Don’t you worry
There’ll be a time when our hearts beat the same
Let life carry

Still love how you say my name
I still taste you kissing my pain away
Still see your tears through the rain
These burning sensations sustain

Feel the distance, bring us closer
Water would cool and soothe my pain
We can touch now
Just hold on now
Bridges would never burn again
Water would cool and soothe my pain
Bridges would never burn again
Water would cool and soothe my pain
Bridges would never burn again
Water would cool and soothe my pain
Bridges would never burn again
Water would cool and soothe my pain
