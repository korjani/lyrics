Hear your heartbeat 
Beat a frantic pace 
And it's not even seven AM 
You're feeling the rush of anguish settling 
You cannot help showing them in 
Hurry up then 
Or you'll fall behind and 
They will take control of you 
And you need to heal the hurt behind your eyes 
Fickle words crowding your mind 

So 
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in 
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within 
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in 
And carry you over to a new morning 

Try as you might 
You try to give it up 
Seems to be holding on fast 
It's hand in your hand 
A shadow over you 
A beggar for soul in your face 
Still it don't mater if you won't listen 
If you won't let them follow you 
You just need to heal 
Make good all your lies 
Move on and don't look behind 

So 
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in 
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within 
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in 
And carry you over to a new morning 

Day after day 
Fickle visions messing with your head 
Fickle, vicious 
Sleeping in your bed 
Messing with your head 
Fickle visions 
Fickle, vicious: 

Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in 
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within 
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in 
And carry you over to a new morning
