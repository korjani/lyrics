What do we have but illusions where one man's absolute is another's choice
Giving in to confusion, till love and hate both tempt with the same voice
Won't you take me to a higher ground, I need to see again the way I'm bound
N' choose the uneasy redemption, run by fear and the flaws of attraction

Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, I see my heart, waving me bye-bye
Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side

If life itself has a meaning, is it anything more than what we choose to call it
Sweet words make appealing, but they only serve to mask the smell of what you buried 
Is it worth your while to spend on a lie, even though you cannot see eye to eye
N' give in to the rumor seduction, run by fear and all the good intentions

Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, like my love, kissing me good bye
Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side

If this is how we think we make amends
We're in for a race that never ends
Where is it we think we'll go
What is it we think we know
It'll never change until we change ourselves

Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, I see my heart, waving me bye-bye
Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, like my love, kissing me good bye
Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side
