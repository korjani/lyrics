You've been biting bullets all these years, I know
There beside yourself, choking on tears
And you aced avoiding possibility
When you placed your bets on bittersweet

Now don't you worry
No need to be sorry
Time to step lightly

Cause the love you used to feel is still there, inside
It may be a faded photograph, but I know you care, so don't hide
If you're scared, I'm here beside you
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
And I give you peace when peace is fragile
Love is all the good in you
Love is peace when peace is fragile

You've been going out of way to agree
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong
Just to be somebody else's genie
Catering to your disaster's every need
Waiting to finally be set free

I said, baby, don't worry
Life will carry
Just take it slowly

[2x]
Cause the love you used to feel is still there, inside
It may be a faded photograph, but I know you care, so don't hide
If you're scared, I'm here beside you
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
And I give you peace when peace is fragile
Love is all the good in you
Love is peace when peace is fragile
