Here's my confession
'Cus I can't keep  it in me
And you know I'm breathless as I come undone
Undone before you

Loving every heartache
Revel in every twist and turn
I can feel your wisdom burning me
Like a second sun

Please forgive me
I can't lay down to waste time
Going crazy running out of

Why's it feel, like it kills when you're leaving me?
Am I still hanging on to the ends of yesterday in me
When I was crying for my fears, bitter tears
But you made me see we're crazy running 
Crazy running like we're running out of time

Take my aggression as a gift to show us what we need to change
Thoughts we need to rearrange 
'Cus we're alright now

Here's my confession
Though I don't bow to authority
Right and wrong are my left and right

And this feels like we're crazy running 
Like we're running out of time
Forgive me I can't lay down waiting

Why's it feel, like it kills when you're leaving me?
Am I still hanging on to the ends of yesterday in me
Still defining all my fears, bitter tears
You made me see we're crazy running 
Crazy running like we're running out of time

Why's it feel, like it kills you're not leaving me?
Am I still hanging on to the ends of yesterday in me
When I was crying for my fears, bitter tears
But you made me see we're crazy running 
Crazy running like we're running out of time
