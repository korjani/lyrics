I ain't so pure of heart myself that
I can go and say how you should be
But I know the temptation
The meaning you will give your life is
Up to you
No safety guaranteed
But it will be amazing

Spectres of suspicion
Hone in on your love
Hungry inquisition
Always wanting more

Here I am
Look at me now, you're living
In a world of wonder
Come to me now
We will make it somehow
Here I am
Singing your song, believing
Though the world's asunder
This is our time
And our love is crystalline

Place your hand against the wall and
Follow every contour 'till you're free
Yourself forgiven
So what are you a slave to now when
Every winding maze will disappear?
What makes your prison?

Spectres of suspicion
Hone in on your love
Hungry inquisition
Always wanting more

Here I am
Look at me now, you're living
In a world of wonder
Come to me now
We will make it somehow
Here I am
Singing your song, believing
Though the world's asunder
This is our time
And our love is crystalline

When it seems like there ain't no way out
And you feel like going underground
What's the choice where everybody wins?
Past the point of no return
This labyrinth will up and burn
As bright as the puppet master grins

You will stand a vision
Of your world of wonder
And play your hand, magician
Like there's no tomorrow

Here I am
Look at me now, you're living
In a world of wonder
Come to me now
We will make it somehow
Here I am
Singing your song, believing
Though the world's asunder
This is our time
And our love is crystalline
