More than you know it, i'm aware
Of this connection that we share
Yeah I know it seems like sometimes I don't care
But you are the colours that I wear
It's been a few hours, nearly dawn
You've been real quiet all along
Now I cannot help but think there's something wrong
Hey baby what's going on?

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better)
On our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright

If I have been thoughtless, let me know
I can take a hint you know
Though i'm a little slow
Just don't keep it in you
Lest it take root and grow
The bottom line here is I love you so

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better)
On our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright

3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better)
We're on our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright

Ooooh

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better)
On our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright

Ooooh

3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better)
On our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright
