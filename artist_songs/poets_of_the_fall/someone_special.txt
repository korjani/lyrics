I wake up to the sound of rain upon my sill 
Pick up the pieces of my yesterday old thrill 
Can I deliver this used up shiver 
To how I pronounce my life 
And I leave it up to faith to go by its own will 

Back row to the left, a little to the side 
Slightly out of the place 
Look beyond the light, where you'd least expect 
There's someone special 

A foggy morning greets me quietly today 
I smell a fragrance in the wind blowing my way 
And ever further I run to find her 
I yearn to define my life 
Placing my faith in chance to meet me in half way 

Back row to the left, a little to the side 
Slightly out of the place 
Look beyond the light, where you'd least expect 
There's someone special 

And she's here to write her name 
On my skin with kisses 
In the rain, hold my head and ease my pain 
In a world that's gone insane 

Back row to the left, a little to the side 
Slightly out of the place 
Look beyond the light, where you'd least expect 
There's someone special
