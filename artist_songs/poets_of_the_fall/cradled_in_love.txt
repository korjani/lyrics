You had the blue note sapphire eyes,
To back up all those gazes
To pierce my guard and to take my soul off to faraway places
Told me I'll never be alone, 

'Cause you're right there

We took a gamble with this love,
Like sailing to the storm
With the waves rushing over to take us,
We were battling against the tide
You were my beacon of salvation, 

I was your starlight

So don't cry for your love,
Cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love
Don't cry for your love,
Cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love

I kept the love you gave me alive,
And now I carry it with me
I know it's just a tear drop from mother earth,
But in it I can hear a dolphin sing
Telling me I'll never be alone,

I know you're right there

So with the fire still burning bright,
I wanna gaze into your light
If I could see my fortune there,
You know how flames can hypnotize
Do I even dare to speak out your name for fear,
It sounds like, like a lover

So don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love
Don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love
Don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love
Don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy
'Cause you're alive cradled in love

Cradled in love
Cradled in love
Cradled in love
Cradled in love
Cradled in love
