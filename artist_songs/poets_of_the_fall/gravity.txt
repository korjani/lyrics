Here at the station, standing in the rain, lost in my train of thought
Looking around for a better time again, but yesterday ain't running on this track

Unpredictable fortune, my past, lights up my future, at last, ending my torture

Like gravity like love,
You get up after you fall
Like gravity like love
I'm not afraid anymore
Like gravity like love,
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more

Out of no reason I've decided to stay, present a solution, to the problem,
Typical of me, that I concentrate on the destination so much that I miss the journey there and back

Unpredictable fortune, my past, lights up my future, at last, ending my torture

Like gravity like love,
You get up after you fall
Like gravity like love
I'm not afraid anymore
Like gravity like love,
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more

If gravity was love, if gravity was love, if gravity was love...
