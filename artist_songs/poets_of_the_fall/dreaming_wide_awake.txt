Too late, the melody is over 
The joke seems to be on me cos I'm the one not laughing 
Down here on the floor

Deflate, the mystery of living
In the most heartless fashion I could ever Imagine
No pretense of decor

Another place and time, without a great divide 
And we could be flying deadly high
I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake

Another place and time, without a warning sign
And we could be dying angel style
I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake

I'll dream you... wide awake

With me, disaster finds a playfield
Love seems to draw dark, twisted pleasure tearing at me
Cos I can't let you go

Mercy, like water in a desert
Shine through my memory like jewelry in the sun
Where are you now

Another place and time...

I'll dream you... wide awake

It's like I'm racing to the sun, blindly face the blazing gun
Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you
Like I'm racing not to run, give more when I have none
Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you... wide awake

Another place and time...

I'll dream you... wide awake.
