The devil may smile with an angels face
A cat may be stolen of its grace
They say it's just a matter of time and place

A man may be less than an animal
The antichrist write up the honor roll
The tightrope walker take the final fall
(at his house, in the bathroom, on a holiday, and that's in the news)

Oh, the things you see
Makes ignorance bliss for you and me, yeah,
When arrogance does publicity, 
Smiling happily

It's a merry go round and around and around

The begging boy becomes the begging man
The zealot never saves the sacrificial lamb
And a child want's to know if the Candyman can

Everybody want's the fancy car
And we've all been told not to run too far
But everybody wants to be a rock'n'roll star

Oh, the things you see
Makes arrogance seem the way to be, yeah, 
When ignorance spreads conformity, 
Smiling happily

It's a merry go round and around and around
