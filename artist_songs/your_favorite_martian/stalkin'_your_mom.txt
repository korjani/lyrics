I hope she's wearing that blue business suit today.
What time is it? Six?
Just in time to hide in these bushes.

Haha, I've been stalkin' your mom
For like two years straight.
I'm way too shy to ask her out on a date.
So I just wait in your neighbors' lawn
With my camera ready and my camouflage on.
And I know that I'll get plenty pics
Once she leaves for work at exactly seven twenty-six.
I follow her on my bike, but it's hopeless.
Cause I'll never keep up with her Ford Focus.
So I kidnapped her golder retriever.
Wanted to return it just to please her
But forgot to feed her.
Taking care of a dog is hard.
Gave it to her dead, said it got hit by a car.

Yo, I dressed up as a pizza delivery guy.
Show up at the door and give her a pie.
She says:
(I didn't order nuttin' you geek.)
(You've been giving me free pizza like once a week.)
Oops, so I disguise my voice with a device
So she don't know what my voice sounds like.
So when I call like a telemarketer just to talk to her
She don't think the pizza guy is stalkin' her
Sometimes I stay in my bathroom for days
Just looking at the scrapbooks I made.
My life-size doll is almost there.
I just need a couple more strands of hair.

Aw, I love World of War, Warcraft.

(Hey, what's this right here?)
Oh, that's just my yearbook.
