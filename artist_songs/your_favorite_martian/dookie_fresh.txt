I-I-I I had a hot date so I picked her up at eight, sharp
Her body was bangin’
This chick was built with great parts (whistles)
Then she was beautiful, I didn’t really know her
But I noticed when I picked her up, she had a funny odor
I was really confused cuz she had a gorgeous body
But she stunk like Precious dropped a deuce in a port-a-potty
Her funk was crazy strong, killin me with deadly stank
It made me wanna do a cannon ball into a septic tank
To get away from the stank
I gave her a dozen roses but they wilted and I think that she’s hot
But I don’t even know if I can do this
Cuz she smells like R. Kelly’s date mixed with raw sewage
Her breath smells like a homeless man pooped in her mouth
She needs to bathe herself in tomato juice or I’m out
She’s ridiculously fine!
So who woulda guessed that this girl smells so Dookie Fresh

I gotta admit she knocked me off my feet
Even with her stench of wet dog and taco meat
She said “Puff, I really like you, and I’d rally be embarrassed
if you didn’t peep my heritage and meet my parents.”
So I drove to their house, and I parked the car
And it smelled like Amy Winehouse threw up in a jar
And it got worse as soon as we entered her parents’ house
I started gagging’ like I had a pubic hair in my mouth
Should I run home and take a shower in bleach? “Yes!”
Her mom stank like Lady Gaga’s old ass meat dress
“Paparazzi!” Shut up, this shit ain’t funny!
Even her dad smelled like the inside of Batman’s onesy
Her mom made us dinner and I couldn’t even eat it
Cuz she smelled like a piece of meat between the lunch lady’s cleavage
I really like this girl, but I feel like givin’ in
To To To be honest she smells like an Indian
“Hey, that’s not funny!”
No, no I mean like Indian food
Like curry smells bad, Indian food!
“You’re a dick!”

And now she wants to get serious
I don’t know what it is
But if I don’t get away from the smell
Imma throw myself off a bridge
I gotta end it!
She smells like Venus Williams’ panties after playin’ tennis
There’s no way that I can win this
We go out to eat before we even get a seat
She makes all the people in the restaurant clear out into the street
Like a fuckin’ fire drill
They skip their entire meal
Yo Deejay should I leave her, or should I try and chill?
Ah! I’ve had worse [3x]
Smash that ass anyway
Ah! I’ve had worse
Puff, plug your nose and smash that ass anyway
Naw, I think I’m gonna leave her and I wish her the best
But somebody needs to tell her that she’s Dookie Fresh

So yeah it didn’t work out
I mean, that girl smelled like Chewbacca’s ass
Wait, wait… Oh.
Well, maybe it was me
“Yeah, I told you you’re a dick!”
