Rage! rage! rage! rage!

Rage hard!

Laugh like the head of apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rise up in millions get off your knees
Dispelling the demons
In the valley of danger
We all work together, sculptures in sorrow
With love light to follow, on
Sweet head of apollo

Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the wor(l)d from losing

Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard

Rage!

Rage hard

Though blue eyes of children
They shine without fear
Hope is the future, with oceans of cheer
Nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
Though laughter of angels resounding
From heaven keep fighting the favours
Of charlatan saviours, charlatan saviours

Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark

I don't know which way to go
My love's like driven snow
When we past the test of time
My love you shall be mine
And if only, lost and lonely
Is all that's wrong with me, we' ll be free
Be free, be free

Laugh like the head of apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rage hard
Rage hard
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in

Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing
