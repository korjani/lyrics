This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells
The colours of the sheddred sky
Hear the children sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Breaks the chains we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

Don't you forget
What you give is what you get
Take love away there's nothing
Better not let the side down
So God on high has opened up the sky
Up the sky

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells
The colours of the sheddred sky
Hear the children sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Break the chain we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

We're all walking through the fire
Walking on the nile
Let your spirit fly

This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time
Sing

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
The legend of this dying land
The earth is acorched by devil's hand
This place we love can live again
We rise up and sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Break the chaing we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game
