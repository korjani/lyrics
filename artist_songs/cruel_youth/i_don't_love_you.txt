Yes I lied, don't think about you all the time
All my switchblade words ain't aim to cut your sweet delusions
I messed up, I confess that I got hooked
Champagne pirouettes and bathroom trips
Are my confusion

Where were you when we were gettin' high?
Where were you when when I thought I died?
Throw out your liquor amen, no time for you in my bed

It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late to count the reasons why
I don't love you
It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late to make me change my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you

Once or twice, I regret that you got played
Now you're sober, party's over
It's just awkward moments
It's just me, sociopathic tendencies
Smiling faces, cold embraces
Testing my  composure

Where were you when we were gettin' high?
Where were you when when I thought I died?
Throw out your liquor amen, no time for you in my bed

It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late to count the reasons why
I don't love you
It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late to make me change my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you

No surprise, you show up again
Let it go, liquor got you feeling yourself
Waste my time but that shit don't fly
No surprise, you show up again
Let it go, liquor got you feeling yourself
Waste my time but that shit don't fly

It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late to make me change my mind
I don't love you
It's too damn late to cry
It's too damn late count the reasons why
I don't love you

"Come around here again, I'll have your head kicked in ya piece of shite.
Don't think I'm letting you off all that money you owe me.
I knew it was you who took all me pay ya cheap bastard, you want you face rearranging with my fist's you do,
I'll have your face looking like a fucking picassa"
