I met him in Seattle, he was gettin' down on a bottle
Telling lies in the Blue Moon Bar
His face was hard and travelled, and as the wine unravelled
I saw a man who could laugh about his scars

He said, I got shanghaied in Vegas by a painted woman
I got hog-tied by a hustler in Ohio
I got derailed by a dancer down in Dallas
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go

He said a girl named Nancy, once tickled his fancy
And backed it up with a fifty dollar smile
He laughed when he remembered, the pain of sweet surrender
But heartaches never seemed to cramp his style

He said, I got tongue-tied by a teacher in Tallahassee
I got french-fried by a waitress in Idaho
I got way-laid by a widow in Wyoming
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go

He said, I got shanghaied in Vegas by a painted woman
I got hog-tied by a hustler in Ohio
I got derailed by a dancer down in Dallas
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go
