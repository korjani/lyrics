Hey Lady Godiva, ridin' throughout town
Naked on your big white horse
With your long hair hangin' down
Lady Godiva, you say you're frightened
And so shy
I hate to bust your bubble but you
Sure picked a funny place to hide
Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' for a place
Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face
Lady Godiva, you say you wanna be loved
For what's inside
I don't know much about horses but you
Sure picked a funny place to ride
Every man's just a clutchin' hand
Reachin' out to grab you
Every man's a quiverin' lance
Tryin' hard to stab you - don' let 'em nab you
Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' kind of scared
You showed 'em all your talents
And nobody seems to care
Lady Godiva, could it be no-one wants to ride
Come to think it over
You may have picked the perfect place to hide
