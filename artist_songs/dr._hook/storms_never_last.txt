Storms never last do they babe
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun wanna shine

You followed me down so many roads, babe
I picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And every road we took lord knows our search was for the truth
And the clouds brewin' now won't be the last

But storms never last do they babe
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun wanna shine

Storms never last do they babe
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun wanna shine

Storms never last do they babe
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun wanna shine
