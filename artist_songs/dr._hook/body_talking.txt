You walked into the room
I smelt your perfume
And I could see your body talkin'
Got up and grabbed the chance
C'mon we're gonna dance
'Cause I can see your body talkin'

You never said a thing
But baby just the same
The things you weren't sayin'
Kept poundin' in my brain
Right there on the floor
I saw you wanted more
'Cause I could see your body talkin'

I feel every quiver
I feel every shiver
Action speaks louder than words
I know what your sayin'
When your body's swayin'
Girl you got a way to make your feelings heard

You never said a thing
But baby just the same
The things you weren't sayin'
Kept poundin' in my brain
Right there on the floor
You knew I wanted more
And I could see your body talkin'

I can feel your motion
Rockin' like the ocean
Action speaks louder than words
I know what your sayin'
When your body's playin'
Girl you got a way to make your feelings heard

Right there on the floor
You knew I wanted more
And I could see your body talkin'
(I can feel it)

I feel every shiver
I feel every quiver
I can feel your body talkin'
(I can feel it)

I can feel your heat now
I can feel your beat now
I can feel your body talkin'
I can feel your body talkin'

I can see your body
I can feel your body
Talkin', talkin'
(I can feel it)

I can feel your body
I can see your body
I can feel your body
Talkin', talkin'
(I can feel it)
