I'm gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, Cause all I'm gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural
Ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
I'll trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural
But don't you ask me how
It's been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now

I'm gonna throw it out the window, some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
And we'll be makin' it natural, makin' it natural
