Lay down
Let's explore this tenderness between us
There ain't no one around at all to see us
And baby would you mind
If maybe you and I
Took a little time to find each other?

Baby, we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow?
We got everything we need
To plant a lovin' seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow

Stay down
Stay at least until the fire stops burnin'
At least until the room has stopped its turnin'
And when the embers dyin' low
We're lyin' in the afterglow
It'll be as sweet as anything we've ever known

Baby, we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow?
We got everything we need
To plant a lovin' seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow

Baby, we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow?
We got everything we need
To plant a lovin' seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow

Baby, we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow?...
