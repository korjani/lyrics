Sleeping late, sleeping late

Whenever I sleep late you know I can dream
Some of the strangest things that you've ever seen
I could never tell you the things that I do in my head
Leaving nothing unsaid, sleeping late in my bed

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Sometimes I'm embarrassed by devious thoughts
When I'm undercover let me never get caught
Crazy notions begin with that old devil grin on my face
We're such a disgrace, me and my pillow-case

Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late

The blissful state of sleeping late has been known to compensate
And sometimes even stimulate
I for one appreciate, sleeping late
Ain't it great sleeping late

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Live and in colour, my wildest of dreams
The best ones are re-runs if you know what I mean
I don't believe I can wait for that clock to stop ringing in my ear
It's so lovely here, I may sleep for a year

Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late.....
