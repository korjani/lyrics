I don't need to see you on a television screen
I don't wanna see your face on Time magazine
I know that you are finer than any movie queen
I wanna see you face on the pillow next to me

I don't care that you ain't been to all the finest schools
It's alright by me if you forget the golden rules
'Cause you got that body and you know how to use it
And I got my guitar so I can make my music

Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love, makin' love, makin' love, makin' love

You don't need to think that you need fortune or fame
I get so excited when you whisper my name
Your sweet love is all it takes to make my fire burn
All it takes is music to make my world turn turn

Turn on my guitar, that'll turn me on
Keep the music playing and let the feeling come
You'll be the woman and I'll be the man
And we'll make love and music any time we can

Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love, makin' love, makin' love, makin' love

Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love and music, makin' love and music
Makin' love, makin' love, makin' love, makin' love
