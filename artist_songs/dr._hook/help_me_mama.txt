Help me mama she's touching my heart
And I just can't keep her away
Stop her mama I can't let it start
Mama please make her go away

Stop her mama, she's starting to speak
I'm afraid she might talk me away
Help me mama, I'm getting weak
'Cause I've been through this before and I can't take anymore
Mama please make her go away

Mama, she's getting so close I'm afraid
Mama she's got me feeling that same old way

Help me mama she's touching my heart
And I just can't keep her away
Stop her mama I can't let it start
'Cause I've been through this before and I can't take anymore
Mama please make her go away

Mama, she's getting so close I'm afraid
And Mama she's got me feeling that same old way
Mama, she's getting so close I'm afraid
And Mama she's got me feeling that same, same, same old way
