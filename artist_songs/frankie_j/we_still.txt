[Verse 1]
I know that you and I have been through many downs before oh yeah...
But that don't mean the chance 
Has gone away to love each other more
We've struggled and we've fought
To keep us both between the lines oh yeah...

Through many years we've cried our tears
And always kept our pride aside...so you can't say that...

[Chorus]
We still...
Always argue all the time
Never make love when its right
We still...
Never say we love each other
Always up in one another
We still...
Fight for every little thing
Never ever stop to think that we still...
Always loved each other

[Verse 2]
I know at times, you'd believe we would never change..oh yeah...
You said we'd never change...
That it was much to overcome
Much of an obstacle to take mmmm
But you were always one 
To always think the worst of things yeah...

Yeah...yeah..
So it was always me to take the stand
And take the initiative so you can't say that...

[Chorus]

We still...fight for every little thing
Never ever stop to think that we still
Always loved each other

[Chorus]
