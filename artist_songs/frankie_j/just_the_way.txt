When you pass me by...
You got me all shook up
Got me all shook up lady...oh

[Verse 2]
Well we've been goin out
And we've been hanging out
And you've been tellin people
We're just friends
Tell me what I should believe
What about the kisses
What about the hugs
What about those nights of makin love
What about all the above

Cuz you really make me feel yeah...
Like no other one i've felt before yeah...

[Rap]
It's like I dread
Every time you go
I know that we friends
But I want much more
I wanna...pull you close
And whisper in you ear
I need you ma...just stay right here
With me...but you always leave
Before I can open up my mouth to speak
Then I'm left by myself all alone
But I yearn for the day to complete my soul
And I don't know if it's you
But you make me feel...
Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But this is more than a crush, more than a lust, could
it be that I'm fallin in naaa...It can't be...It can't be that
Only a fool can love someone who don't 
Love them back...and that won't be me... no way no how...but i gotta
Tell you this right now that... 

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
