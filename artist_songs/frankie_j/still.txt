I got a call late last night from a number I didn't know 
It was so strange I knew who it was from the moment she said hello 
And I paused for a minute 
I couldn't believe it 
I kept my cool so my girl just wouldn't see She said, "I'm sorry but there's something you
should know" 
This is what she said to me, 

"I didn't let you go 
No I can't let you go" 
She said, "I'm having such a hard time" 
Then I heard, "I didn't let you go 
I just can't let you go" 
And then she said, "I think I'm loosing my mind 

"'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I've interupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again" 

So I told her my heart felt 
The same that it did before (as it did before) 
Its never changed 
My feelings never went away girl (no) 
My heart never closed the door (no, no it never closed the door) 
Then I stopped for a minute gotta think about my lady 
And what we have going on (what we have going on) 
She's about to have my baby 
Girl, you waited much to long 

I gotta let you go 
I'm haning up the phone 
This conversation can't go on no more 
I gotta let you go 
'Cause if I don't let you go 
I fear that I met let you know 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

Now I'm doing just fine with my girl 
Not about to let her go (can't let her go, let her go) 
Just because you find me once again it doesn't mean you're coming back home
(doesn't mean youre coming back home)
Now its been about 2 years or so (its been about 2 years) 
Since we went our separate ways (went our separate ways) 
You gotta face the fact we're over with and done 
'Cause I 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess, Baby 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again, Baby 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

'Cause I still love you (cause I still l, I still love you Baby) 
Yes I still need you
(but I better not talk about it cuz I rather move on with my life and do what I gotta do) 
Yes I still want you (im sorry Baby) 
You gotta move on 
So if I interupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

I promise I won't call you ever again
