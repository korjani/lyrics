I looked at him 
He looked at me 
I still had one leg out my jeans 
(where do I go) 
Running through my head 
I guess I should've listened when she said 

(Hurry up) 
Grab your shoes 
(Hurry up) 
Grab your clothes 
(Hurry up) 
Cause my man should be home 
Hit the street 
(Hurry up) 
Disappear 
(Hurry up) 
Gotta get outta here 
Baby, he's crazy, 
maybe he'll kill you 
Leave your number 
I'll Call you 
Whatever you just need to 
Just Leave 

(Hurry up) 
Grab your shoes 
(Hurry up) 
Grab your clothes 
(Hurry up) 
Cause my man should be home 
Hit the street 
(Hurry up) 
Disappear 
(Hurry up)
