Baby I gotta say what's on my mind
Girl I think that it's about time
I gotta let you know
That I want a lil more
Cuz this is killing me
It's burning inside

No more holding back
Baby you set my soul on fire
Gotta face the fact
That I ain't never this way before

We started off as friends and everything was cool...ooo
But things started getting a lil serious between me and you
Late night phone calls
Talking til like 3 in the morn
We found ourselves caught up
In the moment

Days we spent together
And the nights you used to kick it at the club
Just like one of us
You always seemed to fit in
You always played your position
And I think that you could be the one
