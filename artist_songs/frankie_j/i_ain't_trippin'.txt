Yeah, Yeah, I ain't trippin' oh yeah 
First day at work, I met you 
You laid your pretty eyes on me (me) 
Right then I knew it be something 
I didn't know what it could be 
So I, asked if you had a man and you showed me the ring on your hand 
The look on your face, when I asked you for your name 
Your expression said it all to me, yeah 
I can't deny, you stayed on my mind 
Too bad I got a girl and you can't be mine. 
But damn you're so fine (fine) 
I think it's worth a try, so girl let's just get down 

I won't tell, if you wont tell 
I'm trying to keep it on the low 
Cause if he finds out and she finds out 
You know it's gonna end for sure 
Its gonna end for sure baby 

Even though you got a man (man) 
And even though I got a girl (girl) 
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin') 
I like the way it's going down 

Even though you got a man (man) 
And even though I got a girl (girl) 
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin') 
I like the way it's going down 

When we went out on our first date (first date) 
I remember it was Thursday (Thursday) (yeah) 
It was the day before we got paid (We got paid) 
And I can't front, I dint know what to say (nah) 
It was supposed to be business, that's what we both said 
We had some drinks and ended up in a hotel bed 
I really hope this doesn't get around 
So keep it on the low and we can keep on getting down 

I know we crossed the line when we got down girl (down girl) 
But how could something wrong feel oh so right (so right) 
We both got down so don't say nothing 
You know I'll be around do a lil' something 
Me and you, you and getting down (getting down) 

Even though you got a man (man) 
And even though I got a girl (girl) 
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin') 
I like the way it's going down 

Even though you got a man (man) 
And even though I got a girl (girl) 
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
