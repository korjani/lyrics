Excuse me baby... 
I'd just rather be sincere 
Cause there ain't no guy like me 
That can give you what you need 

Did ya like my 6-4 Impala? 
Always on my mind 
Take a trip up to the Bahamas 
With ya by my side 
Cause I know you deserve 
For you to see the world... baby girl 

You deserve 
The house, the cars, the ring, baby 
You deserve 
Whatever you need, shoppin' sprees 
You deserve 
The life, the mind, to be free 
You deserve it all 
So what's it gonna take to get with you? 

If you were my girl 
You'd be the top of the line, my model 
You don't have to worry about nada 
In my Gucci, Louis, my Prada 
If you were my girl 
You'd be the top of the line in my Phantom 
The perfect things you'd have 'em 
Top of the Line 

The way that you walk girl 
It's top of the line 
You'd be my everything 
Top of the line 

(Slim)
First look I knew I had to make you mine 
See your style and it seems to fit mine 
Say it like you have everything, still incomplete 
It would be so much better if you only had me 

You deserve 
The house, the cars, the ring, baby 
You deserve 
Whatever you need, shoppin' sprees 
You deserve 
The life, the mind, to be free 
You deserve it all 
So what's it gonna take to get with you? 

If you were my girl 
You'd be the top of the line, my model 
You don't have to worry about nada

Top of the Line 

The way that you walk girl 
It's top of the line 
You'd be my everything 
Top of the line 

No matter what you do 
At the end of the day she'll forget about you 
She'll be calling my phone while you're all alone 
Waiting on her call 
Let's see who gets her first
