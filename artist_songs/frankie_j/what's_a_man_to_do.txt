Ayo...you see I got a lil situation right...
You see my shorty she be trippin' sometimes...
And I'm fittin to let ya'll know what it's all about

Oh...Ladidi-dadadida
Ayo...listen to my story
Yeah, yeah...come on...uh..

[Verse 1]
Well it all started on a late night creepin...
I planned my getaway
Cause my shorty she was trippin
Just trying to get out
Breathe a lil different air
If you know what I mean yeah..

So as I'm jumping out the window of my room...
I hear my homies calling out
They're on the move
Driving Escalades and Hummers with them blades
Hiding behind shades, ready on their way..yeah..
It's how we roll...
So as we driving, we ended up on the strip
We see some hunnies and damn!
I just began to flip..
Cause this shorty she be staring straight at me
This sexy fine lady..she be callin me now...

[Chorus]
What's a man to do 
When situations like these come to you ..damn
What's a man to say..
When shorty's just drivin you insane..
What's a man to do..
When you and your girl
Just can't pull through...damn..
What's a man to say..
When everything just ain't the same...

[Verse 2]
See I'm trying to find a way out of this misery
Cause only God knows this is not the way I be
I'm just too young to be stressin this ain't right for me
So she better act up
Or I'm gonna straight up and leave...
This is not the first time
That we go through this...
It's 'bout the second, third, fourth maybe even fifth
And I've been trying to work it out
Only with you babe...
So listen close 'cause not all men are the same...

So what's a man gotta do
So we work this
I've just about tried almost everything I can
So let me learn you something
And you better learn right quick
Girl get yo act together
Or I'm about to have a fit...

[Chorus]

Come on...can you feel me...yeah..that's right

[Chorus repeat till fade]
