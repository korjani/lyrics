But I must say that I be checkin' you out when you roll through my hood
Got everybody like, damn, who's that, introduce me
What's her name, who she with, she a cutie
What she doin', what she lookin' like that

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my baby to keep
It's his touch, his smile, his sweater, his style
He's fly and he's all mine
I don't mind, he's out late at night
He's my best friend, I trust him
So promise me, you'll always do me right
He's my boo, my man
Riding with me til the end
He's my boy, my friend
See with him I get's my freak on

And I'll love her til the end
I'm so glad that she's the one for me, oh yea

And I'm glad that she's the one for keeps
