I'm the kind of man 
Who really doesn't take the time to understand 
That what I did was wrong 
But girl you forced my hand 
And now girl look at me 
Got people saying 
I'm not that crazy 
Okay I take it back 
Whatever it was I said 
Oh girl I take it back 
Where in the hell was I when you started to pack your bags? 
Why didn't you talk to me? 
What about my letters? 
Did you ever get 'em? 

Still smell your scent all in my bed 
I'm at the place where we first met 
And I'm sending you a ticket 
And if you still feel it 
Meet me there 
'Cause when I look at me I'm like a puzzle Without the pieces I need 
Girl I'm in trouble 
I need you to come and save me 
Oh, I miss my baby 
I need you there 
Say you'll be there 
Ride a jet over seas 
Hotels are on the beach 
To be with you again is priceless 

Now I'm in the room 
Watching the clock every hour waiting to here from you 
I called the airline they said you'll be landing soon 
So I'm on my way 
I got a thousand things in my head I want to say girl 
I love you and I miss 
Would it be too much if I kiss you 
Baby let me paint this picture 
I ain't shit if I ain't with you 
No, no, oh no, oh no 
Should I listen? 
Is that what was missing? 
Tell me baby 

Still smell your scent all in my bed (in my bed) 
I'm at the place where we first met 
I'm sending you this ticket 
And if you still feel it 
Meet me there 
'Cause when I look at me I'm like a puzzle (When I look at me Baby) 
Without the pieces I need 
Girl I'm in trouble 
I need you to come and save me (I need your love) 
Oh I miss my baby (cause I need your love) 
I need you there (I ned you there oh Babe oh Baby) 
Say you'll be there (I'm lonely without you) 
Ride a jet over seas (I'll pay for everythihng) 
Hotels are on the beach (but that don't mean a thing) 
To be with you again is priceless (if you're not here with me) 

I'm at the airport waiting on you 
Wishing you'd show up 
I hope you do 
If you still believe 
You're my missing piece 
The guard is telling me 
Man I got to leave 

I'm at the airport waiting on you 
Wishing you'd show up 
I hope you do 
If you still believe 
You're my missing piece 
I know money can buy me anything 
Except for you 

When I look at me I'm like a puzzle Without the pieces I need 
Girl I'm in trouble 
I need you to come and save me (said I need you Baby) 
Oh I miss my baby (come and save me) 
I need you there (got a big ol house up on the hill 
Say you'll be there (but its so empty 'cause you're not here) 
Ride a jet over seas 
Hotels are on the beach 
To be with you again is priceless (I need you Baby)
