Girl you been kicking it with me constantly, for a while
You just can't wait to hear those three little words
Come from my mouth, yea yea yea

I just can't tell you
Or find the words for
The way I feel about'cha
I just can't be without'cha
I wanna say it so bad but something keeps telling me no
Contemplating, still debating
Should I just let it go

I just can't say it's love
But you already know what's up
I really can't put into words
Baby you got to feel me
And I hope you can hear me
It's only you I'm thinkin of
But still I just can't say it's love

You probably think I'm runnin game
But that ain't the case, I'm just not sure
See I've made that mistake before
Don't wanna hurt no more, babe
I wanna take my time with you, yea

I just can't tell you
Or find the words for
The way I feel about'cha
I just can't be without'cha
I wanna say it so bad but something keeps telling me no
Contemplating, still debating
Should I just let it go

I just can't say it's love
But you already know what's up
I really can't put into words
Baby you got to feel me
And I hope you can hear me
It's only you I'm thinkin of
But still I just can't say it's love

No matter if I wait
This still could be fate
Girl I get so frustrated
My mind, my heart can't take it
Just like the sun had the moon
Baby I want you
But I just can't say I love you
