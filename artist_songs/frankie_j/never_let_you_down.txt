I know we goin through a lot of thangs 
But then I'm really keepin you tight 
'Cause in the true light 
'Cause I wanna do right

'Cause baby I ain't trippin on the meaningless fame, hey 
Never let none test, one flesh

And we can get back up and we can ball if we should fall (if we should fall) 
Its truly a blessin... come directly from Heaven 
Through death and a ressurection
