Nine-one-one, I feel like I'm close to the edge now, but they can't help me. My heart's done, cause she wants to be friends now. Never been so weak. I feel like I'm down to my last breath. I got nothing to live for since you up and left. Listen

I can't live. I won't survive if you don't come back tonight. I need your kiss to keep me alive. Girl, my heart's too young to die.

Critical, baby that's my condition. Do you hear me now? There's no cure, cause it's you that I'm missin. And I just cannot give up. Listen.

I can't live. I won't survive if you don't come back tonight. I need your kiss to keep me alive. Girl, my heart's too young to die.

And no one's gonna take your place, I need to see your face so I can come back. Cause this ain't livin, me without you here in my arms. And you don't understand the pain, I'm just a beat way, this might be your last, chance to save my heart. Oh.

I can't live. I won't survive if you don't come back tonight. I need your kiss to keep me alive. Girl, my heart's too young to die.

I cannot live. I won't survive if you don't come back tonight (baby, just come back). I need your kiss to keep me alive. My heart's too young (nine-one-one) to die (I feel like I'm close to the edge now).
