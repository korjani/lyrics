I never thought this would happen
That my heart would ever learn to love all over again
And I only call you my girl
But over time you have become more than my best friend
And the truth is that I’m so deep in love
And I’m so glad that I never gave up
You hold the key to my heart

Te Amare
Forever more
Te Amare
It is you who I adore
Te Amare
I’ll never let you go
Te Amare
Te Amare
Te Amare
Me Amor
Te Amare

Don’t care to think about my life
If it was with someone else
I put away the doubts
I don’t ever bring him up
Since I put them on the shelf yeah
Heaven sent you down to earth for me
There’s a reason why we’re here to be
Together forever to love honestly
And the truth is that I’m so deep in love
I’m so glad that I just never gave up
You hold the key to my heart

Te Amare
Forever more
Te Amare
It is you who I adore
Te Amare
I’ll never let you go
Te Amare

Your love it doesn’t get no better
Your love is all I want forever
Even when seasons change
Even when it rains
It could never tear us apart

Te Amare
Forever more
Te Amare
It is you who I adore
Te Amare
I’ll never let you go
