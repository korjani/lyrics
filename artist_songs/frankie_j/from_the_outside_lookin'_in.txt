Well she was 5 foot 3
Unique with them brown eyes

Happy till the end with her
So you live in learn

About this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same
Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls
These type of girls
They come and go
Remember when we talked about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation
We had long ago
'Bout the same situation

From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all
You know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all

Yo we must of had a different vision of love
Tender kisses and hugs
Making me weak in my knees

Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us...
I used to miss you so much
