I was coming out my front door. 
When I looked to my left and seen 
The flyest chick I swear I'd ever seen before. 
She must be something special. 
I'd never seen nobody like her ever. 
Everything about this chick was (..). from head to toe. 
And then I noticed that she was smiling at ya boy. 
But before I holla, I gotta make sure that my game is proper. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus:] 
what do you do when you finally see. 
the girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
say something (don't let her pass by) 
say something (just look her in the eyes) 
hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time? 
I know we never met before but I. 
just say something (don't let her pass by) 
say something (cause she only comes once in a lifetime) 

I'm getting ready to step to her, but I noticed her friends 
Was looking at me like they really didn't think I should. 
A lonely man has got to have it. 
He can't let nothing in the world. stop it. 
So excuse me Miss, but can I get your number. 
I think your sexy. can I call you up sometime? 
I get that, baby girl take mine. 
Anytime you wanna call, it's all right. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus:] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes) 
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time? 
I know we never met before but I. 
Just say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (cause she only comes by once in a lifetime) 

I can't believe I found the one right outside my front door. (outside my door) 
It seems like I have heard about this a thousand times before. (a thousand times before) 
So I knew I had to build the nerve, I knew I had to find the words. 
The right thing to say. I just couldn't let you walk away. 

[Chorus:] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes) 
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time? 
I know we never met before but I. 
Just say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (cause she only comes by once in a lifetime) 

tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking. 
tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking. 
tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking. 
tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking.
