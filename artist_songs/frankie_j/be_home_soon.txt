Hello sweetheart, so how was your day
Well I'm just sittin' here
Thinkin' of you...
I feel like I'm a go crazy...

I can't stand no other minute
Away from your heart
I just wanna get on
The first plane home
And head straight into your arms
Yeah...

I know you miss me shorty
I'm missin' you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there
That I'll be home soon...yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be home soon...
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helping our relattion
So I'd rather be there with you...oh
I'll be home soon...
It's just these time got me stressin'
And I haven't been so patient
Cuz I'd rather be there with you oh...

[Verse 2]
Listen now darlin'...
Don't you worry 'bout a thang

Easy for you babe
But i know we're going to make it
Through this rain yeah...
Sometimes my job gets crazy
And it's hard for me too
But I've got to work hard
No matter the cause
And I do it all for you baby yeah...

Cuz I'm missin' you too...
So I swear and I promise
