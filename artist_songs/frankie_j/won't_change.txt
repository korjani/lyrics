i was young i was dumb
didn't know wha i was thinking
use to think that i could rule the world
thats the way...i be living
fast cars always shoping at the malls
never caring for your heart
always with my friend yeah..

till you came along 
and opened up my eyes
you asked me wha was goin on 
seemed that i had changed inside...oh my
said i was triping
and slowly I was slipping
in another bad situation
and i said to myself 
i dont wanna go that route

[chorus]

cuz i dont wanna loose you babe
you know that im still down
i dont wanna loose you babe
just keep me on the ground
i dont wanna loose you babe
you know that i wont change
cuz for u i'll do anythang and everythang
you know that i wont change a thang

and i gotta make it....up to you babe
