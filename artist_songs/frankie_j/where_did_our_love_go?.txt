Yeah yeah
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh 
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh

I'll take the chain off my neck
I'll let them repo my whip
They can take my crib my kicks and all this flashy ice on my wrist
Girl I'll go broke (for ya)
Even walk the streets alone (for ya)
I don't need no friends or relatives around all them people can go
('Cause I thought)
We be together
(And I thought)
We last forever
(And I thought)
That we were perfect for each other but you let them haters on us

Where do I go from here (Where do I where do I)
Where do I go from here (Where do I where do I)
Now that you disappeared (Now that you now that you)
Now that you disappeared
Where did our love go 
Where did where did our love go 
Why am I alone
Why am why am I alone
Tell me where did our love go

Don't wanna go to the club (no)
I don't feel like dressing it up (no)
Ain't gonna be poppin bottles with models 'cause i'm hooked on your love
You can tell Naomi and Diddy I won't be at their party tonight (no)
'Cause i'll be at the crib hoping you call me i'm going out of my mind

('Cause I thought)
We be together
(And I thought)
We last forever
(And I thought)
That we were perfect for each other but you let them haters on us

Where do I go from here (Where do I where do I)
Where do I go from here (Where do I where do I)
Now that you disappeared (Where did you dissappear)
Now that you disappeared
Where did our love go (oh)
Where did where did our love go (Tell me where did it go)
Why am I alone (Why am I all alone)
Why am why am I alone (oh)
Tell me where did our love go (Where did our love go wrong)

Where do I go from here
Where do I go from here
Now that you disappeared 
Now that you disappeared 

[Rap]
Tell me you love you always thinking of me
You kiss me,hug me,squeeze me,rub me
You soft and cuddly when you scream cut me
But we got crossed up and it got ugly
You turn mean I saw you with another dude damn near turned green I envy ya
This love thing so damn strenuous stay on my mind continuous
Around the clock I passed by your spot circle round the block 
but I ain't stalking you told them boots were mad for walking 
but I just thought that was the anger talking

Where do I go from here (Where do I where do I)
Where do I go from here (Tell me where do I go)
Now that you disappeared (Where did you disappear)
Now that you disappeared (Where did it go baby)
Where did our love go 
Where did where did our love go (Where did our love go)
Why am I alone
Why am why am I alone (Why am I all alone)
Tell me where did our love go (Where did our love go wrong)

Where do I go from here 
Where do I go from here 
Now that you disappeared 
Now that you disappeared 
Where did our love go 
Where did where did our love go 
Why am I alone
Why am why am I alone 
Tell me where did our love go wrong
