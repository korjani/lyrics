There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover,
Tomorrow, just you wait and see.

I'll never forget the people I met
braving those angry sky's
I remember well as the shadows fell
the light of hope in their eyes
and though I'm far away I still can hear them say
Sun's up 
for when the dawn comes up

There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover,
Tomorrow, just you wait and see.

There'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after.
Tomorrow, when the world is free

The shepherd will tend his sheep.
The valley will bloom again.
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again.

There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover,
Tomorrow, just you wait and see.

...

There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover,
Tomorrow, just you wait and see.
