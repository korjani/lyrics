Christmas comes but once a year for every girl and boy
The laughter and the joy they find in each new toy
I'll tell you of a little boy who lives across the way
This little fella's Christmas is just another day

He's the little boy that Santa Claus forgot
And goodness knows, he didn't want a lot
He sent a note to Santa
For some soldiers and a drum
It broke his little heart
When he found Santa hadn't come

In the street he envied all those lucky boys
Then wandered home to last year's broken toys
I'm so sorry for that laddie
He hasn't got a daddy
The little boy that Santa Claus forgot
