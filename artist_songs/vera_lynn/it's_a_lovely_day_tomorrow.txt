It's a lovely day tomorrow
Tomorrow is a lovely day

Come and feast your tear-dimmed eyes
On tomorrow's clear blue skies

If today your heart is weary
If ev'ry little thing looks grey

Just forget your troubles and learn to say
Tomorrow is a lovely day

It's a lovely day tomorrow
Tomorrow is a lovely day

Come and feast your tear-dimmed eyes
On tomorrow's clear blue skies

If today your heart is weary
If ev'ry little thing looks grey

Just forget your troubles and learn to say
Tomorrow is a lovely day
