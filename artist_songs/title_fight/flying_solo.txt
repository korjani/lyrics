Go face the facts
your facts are fiction
I'll nod my head, pretend to pay attention
never really understand.
Cause everything you say is nothing to me
how hard is it for you to see
that I don't care anymore.

I'm flying solo from now, forever
Lookin' back, the future will be better
I feel it, I feel it.

Don't give me all your problems
cause I'm not the one to solve them
you think that I care but I guess you're wrong
I don't want your sympathy, apology
cause that's not how it's going to be
I'm setting out, I'm heading out, goodbye.

You won't see my face, I'm leaving here
I won't be back this time next year
I can't slow down to your own sake.
I'm done with you, we never started
Don't get your hopes up, don't leave unguarded
I don't care anymore.

Don't give me all your problems
cause I'm not the one to solve them
you think that I care but I guess you're wrong
I don't want your sympathy, apology
cause that's not how it's going to be
I'm setting out, I'm heading out, goodbye

Don't give me all your problems
cause I'm not the one to solve them
you think that I care but I guess you're wrong
Don't want your sympathy, apology
cause that's not how it's going to be
I'm setting out, I'm heading out, goodbye
