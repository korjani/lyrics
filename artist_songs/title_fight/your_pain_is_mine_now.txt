Swept in like a dream
Drew the sting then I died
White light trembling
Shadows bring tears to eyes

Twisted in a summer mist
burned alive a while
Wrestled with your loneliness
echoed from a wire

Gatling gun
Your pain is mine now
See-through smoke
Clouds warping around
I know you're scared
But don't cry your eyes out
Gatling gun
Under your spell now

Swirling through a tunnel view
Tangled in the dark
Flirting with a kiss of death
A canopy of stars
You'll sleep beneath them
I'm in your room
I am your nightmare
I am the moon

Cry
Die
Boo Hoo

Gatling gun
Your pain is mine now
See-through smoke
Clouds warping around
I know you're scared
But don't cry your eyes out
Gatling gun
Under your spell now
