It was quiet while we walked through Kingston
Hand in hand, the streetlights led us to where you lived
We were alone (we were alone)
And all you could say was
"All good things must come to an end"

You said 
The words in my mouth were more alive than I was
I guess I don't belong here
I guess I don't belong
Why not tie a noose around my neck?
I'm sure it'd be much more subtle than everything that you said
I've played your games too many times and I've grown tired
Yeah, I'm tired

So deal with it
Can't sleep, can't think tonight
I'm stuck
I'm stuck
I can't get out of this
I can't get out of this
