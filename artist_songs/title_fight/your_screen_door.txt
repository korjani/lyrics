I grabbed my things and rode to your place.
I knew you'd be there.
Four twenty three-
on your porch swing talking with me.
And I'm thinking, "What am I doing?"
This is killing me.
I'm dying quietly.
Four twenty three.

I heard your name and thought I'd stop by,
Cut open your screen door,
And sneak in slow.
Just to say hello to you
And see how you've been doing without me.
Call you and see how you've been doing without me.
