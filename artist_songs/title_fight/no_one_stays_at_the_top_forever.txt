I try to find myself
In the shadows of my room
But I was suffocated by
Vacant walls

And solitude
Solitude

Knee deep, I'm losing sleep
Can't find yourself when you've lost everything
I'm hanging on to all your words
Beneath the sheets you buried me
I'm suffocating quietly
Is this record on repeat

You left me with the weight of the world to lift
