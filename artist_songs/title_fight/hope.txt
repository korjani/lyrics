I'll make it obvious, I'm done with this
I don't want anymore
I know it's no different than before
A waste of time with no time to waste
I love to hate mistakes you make
and I know you don't know anything

Enough is enough, word for word
I meant everything you heard
I hope you know
That it goes to show you're like everyone else I know
I hope you know

So even now, I'm still finding out
Just who you are and what you're all about
But I don't like what I see
and still I'm stuck trying hard
To call your bluffs and play the card
I'm all in, my hand is on the table

Enough is enough, word for word
I meant everything you heard
I hope you know
That it goes to show you're like everyone else I know
I hope you know, I hope you know
