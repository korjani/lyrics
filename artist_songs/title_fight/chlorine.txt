Silhouette 
of a violet view 
Felt it fade 
Was it too soon? 

Hollow 
You can't hold it in 

Poison in your mood 
Chlorine eyes from you 

Found your place 
in a model face 
Fell into 
the violent daze 

Hollow 
You can't hold it in 
Pour out 
all your emptiness 

Poison in your mood 
Chlorine eyes from you 
Decorated blue 
Opening a wound 

Wound 
Wound
