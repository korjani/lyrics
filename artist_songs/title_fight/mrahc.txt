Whisper
Floating kisses from a far
Hung your portrait on my wall
Out a spiderweb I crawl

Visible harm
Backwards charm
Stunting growth
Held too close
Saw you choke

Hazy
Sleepy in a heaven's sprawl
Unaware of my faults
Heard you sneaking
through the wall

Harm
Backwards charm
Stunting growth
Held too close
Saw you choke
