Last year, I tried to learn
What makes me so insecure
What better way to pass the time?
I lost myself in my mind

I just want to hear the words you speak
When I'm not around, what do you think?
I think I'm hopeless, I think I think too much
Bruised and broken covered up with blush

Tell me what's wrong
With forcing myself to write it down
Never made a sound
I never second guess I'm right the first time

I just want to hear the words you speak
When I'm not around, what do you think?
I think I'm hopeless, I think I think too much
Bruised and broken covered up with blush 

I was right the first time! [x2]

I'm the fly on my wall but I'm too blind to see
I'm the view from your room, come look straight through me
I'm the fly on my wall but I'm too blind to see
I'm the view from your room, come look straight through me
