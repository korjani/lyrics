I wish I could see you now
After all those times you let me down
And I'll tell you how I feel
And I'll return the favor after this knife's out of my spine
And I'll take back what is mine

Look back and rewind
To all those times that you lied
I wasn't good enough I guess
Think what you want
'Cause I'm better than you thought
You'll miss me soon

You're a mistake
And so I won't catch you when you fall
It's your fault
And I did nothing wrong at all

Take this knife
Out of my spine
I'll take back what's rightfully mine

I know as time goes, one day you'll need me
