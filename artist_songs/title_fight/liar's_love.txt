Losing trust in human touch
It's honest like a liar's love
Disappear as hands draw near
Avoid the longing sense of being one you trust

Don't count on me
I'm not what you need

Ostracized, a loss of pride
There's only shadows on my side
Lessons learned: no one's concern
Lends itself to wounds that won't
repair with time

Don't count on me
I'm not what you need

Temporary but can't be erased
Pushed away to a darker place
