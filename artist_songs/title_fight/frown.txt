It's hard to come to terms 
that things can't be taught but be learned,
like feeling when you question reason.
The ceiling came down this season.

Keep this a secret: 
I hope we never make it past our town.
Forever living with a frown.

I feel like I should be concerned
that things can't be saved once they're burned,
but for once I threw it in the furnace.
I watched it burn right between us.

Keep this a secret: 
I hope we never make it past our town.
Forever living with a frown.

And all along, 
all I ever wanted was someone to tell me I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
I'm gone.
