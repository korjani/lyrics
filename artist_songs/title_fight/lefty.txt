Bad luck never leaves.
Your jinx just floats around 
Like the taste inside your mouth,
or the sound when your skull cracks.
Feel the growing pains.
It means you're growing up too fast.
Telling white lies to black cats.
Stretch me out across the tracks.

While you were sleeping I was blood red,
sharp as a knife inside your stomach.
I'm squeezing tight; don't let the light in.
No medicine.

Daydream tendencies had you smiling soft and sweet.
Keep those blurry memories somewhere safe- 
you may need them.
You can make a wish,
but there's no rabbit out the hat.
Realize it's never coming back.

While you were sleeping I was blood red,
sharp as a knife inside your stomach.
I'm squeezing tight; don't let the light in.
No medicine.
