I'm burning down all of these memories
Throw the ashes out to sea
Forget that you said you'd never change anything

I hope it kills you to know 
that I'm doing worse than the day before

I force myself to sleep
But when I wake up 
you still won't be with me
But in my dreams you remembered my name

Let me be the first
Let me be the last
Let me be the last thing you forget.
