I never was able to say 
Just how I was feeling.
Can't let you see me in this state.
Everything is packed. I'm leaving.

Do you really wanna know?
Do you really?

I feel lost.
I feel boring.
I've been caught sleeping all morning.

Pull down the shades, 
I'd rather stay inside all day.
My own thoughts are in my way.
I'd rather sleep than have to say:

I feel lost. 
I feel boring.
I've been caught sleeping all morning.
I feel scared of knowing 
I'm just a single leaf in the wind blowing.

Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
