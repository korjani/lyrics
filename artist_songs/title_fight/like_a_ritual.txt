First time in a while that everything is fine.
I’d lie to you; I’ve been lying to myself all the time.
And your voice in the back of my head-
wishing things could be quiet.
And your voice, murdering the silence-
consistent like a ritual.

I’d stop and stare imagining that you’d be there.
I’d spend my days wasting my time constantly.

And your voice in the back of my head-
wishing things could be quiet.
And your voice, murdering the silence-
consistent like a ritual
