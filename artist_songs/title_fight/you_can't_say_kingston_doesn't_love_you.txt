Talking to myself
But I can't hear over your mouth
I'm thinking out loud
"What's keeping me around?
What's keeping me chained down to shapes and sounds,
Your parents' car, and your town?"

I'm nervous about staring across the room
And waiting for the walls to move
I don't see anybody else
And I don't need anybody else
I'm dirt beneath your feet.
Step all over me.

I don't see anybody else
And I don't need anybody else
And I don't see anybody else

Oh, use me.
