I walked by your house last night.
Yeah it's always raining.
It's way too cold for this time of year.
And to be honest, I couldn't care to fix this.
The weather is always changing and I swear that I don't mind.

You're spending too much time digging graves
and sharpening your knives.
All's well, wish you the best.
You disagree with thoughts you would suggest.

I drove through your town last night.
I can't believe you live there.
Everything not recognized.
When doors are closed, and you're stuck inside.
I heard that it is brighter if you try.

Can you hear me?
Loud and clearly.
