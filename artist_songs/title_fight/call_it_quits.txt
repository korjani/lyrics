I wish I could tell you what I think about you
But I can't
All these thoughts are overrated

Pile it up, keep it inside
now there's nowhere left to hide
Wish I could tell you, but I can't say it.
But I can't

Seem to lose, all this pride that I've gained
in the back of my mind this feels like a big game
I keep on losing and I don't wanna play
Call it quits

All these thoughts run through my head
at 5000 miles an hour
You know I'd say it if I could

But the first word out of my mouth
Is your name without a doubt
And I'll do anything for you
You know I Would (You know I would)

Can't seem to lose, all this pride that I've gained
in the back of my mind this feels like a big game
I keep on losing and I don't wanna play
Call it quits

You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 
You know I would 

Call it quits!
