I'd nail a Dreamcatcher above my bed,
If I thought it would keep you out of my head,
But that wouldn't help,
I'm reaching out for something else.

The words we never said,
are the ones we never sweat,
The words we never said,
are the ones we never sweat.

Nevermind, 
I'm reaching out for something else.
Nevermind, 
I'm reaching out for something else.

But this time you're out of line.
