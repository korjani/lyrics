It's hard to talk when the words are on the tip of your tongue
It's hard to make a move when you feel like the only one

I'm giving up on you
I've made up my mind
And now I'm going through with this
Don't try to take my thoughts
I still know what I said before
That I know my way, I'm out the door

It's hard to think
When mud leaks on your mind
I hope I get it right this time
I practiced it so many times in my head
This one will be fine

Never going to give up on you
Look in my eyes I know this is the truth
