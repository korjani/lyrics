"Sometimes I can be my own worst enemy... I am my own worst enemy... other times when
I'm alone at night I definitely find myself in the position to be very unhappy with myself...
This is one of those times..."

Go!

I stare into space and hope we're not alone
Am I searching for something that's better than home?
I've been working so hard
Stress is tremendous and pressure is endless
No one on this planet like me to be friends with
I've been working so hard
I've been working so hard

I'm underneath the sun
And I'm underneath the gun

I'm losing my mind and I know there's no remedy
I've become a failure who's living on memories
I've been working so hard
Loneliness can't be cured with no medicine
Look to the stars so they'll straighten my head again
I've been working so hard
I've been working so hard

I'm underneath the sun
And I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away

Yeah, I'm underneath the sun
And I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away

Sometimes
I beat up myself, I
Lock my own way, I
Cloud all my thoughts
Please go away
Oh, nevermind me
I'm checking out now
And won't ever come back
Now that my life doesn't exist

Yeah, you're right, how do it feel to be right, knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong

Yeah, you're right, how do it feel to be right, knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong

Yeah, I'm underneath the sun
And I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away

I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame...
