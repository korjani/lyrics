Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)

When I reminisce
Ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exists
Never be the same as it was 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun living life on the run
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle
So figure it out
Always thinking that you know 
Every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know (you know)
It's like love
Some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste
of hoping it could last

Another day
Another night
Inside a lonely world
Another game
Another fight
Inside a lonely world
Another wrong 
Another right 
Inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world 
Such a lonely world 

Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)

Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I never been a quitter
I remember high school; man I hated high school
It was like prison
With bullies always putting me down
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive them; now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneaking out when my momma's asleep
With my gothic girlfriend, making love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still I never want it all and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise if I lose then I'll figure it out
How the time flies, even with the blink of an eye
When your young you absorb like a sponge in the skies
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's amazing what you learn when you never been taught, y'know

Another day
Another night
Inside a lonely world
Another game
Another fight
Inside a lonely world
Another wrong 
Another right 
Inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world 
Such a lonely world

No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world)

No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world)

Another day
Another night
Inside a lonely world
Another game
Another fight
Inside a lonely world
Another wrong 
Another right 
Inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world 
Such a lonely world

Who's the man (in such a lonely world)
Who's the man (in such a lonely world)
