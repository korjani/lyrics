Give it up, give it up, give it up (haha) 
Give it up, give it up, give it up (woo) 
Give it up, give it up, give it up (yo Lethal) 
Give it up (give it up!) 

Nobody knows what they don't know
so never think you might know me 
And that's something to take home tonight 
Nobody knows the way the candle burns
and I've learned to play both ends 
And that's something to take home tonight 

If I tried enough and get high enough 
Most grown men don't cry enough 
So I'mma, cry myself to sleep gon' cry myself to sleep 
If I tried enough and get high enough 
Most grown men don't cry enough 
So I'mma, cry myself to sleep gon' cry myself to sleep
