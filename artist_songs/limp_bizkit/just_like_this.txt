Get up! Get up!
Like This, just like this 
Do you wanna catch the vibe that's keepin' me alive?
Following these fat ass beats till I die
Fill em with tension, the sick dimension
Rumble the earth with my lowered suspension
Watch the ground move
Let the sound prove
That it aint fake when the girls get naked
Don't call it a comeback
We bring that beat back
And we made sure that John kept them beats phat
A lyrical rampage burnin' your headset
Open your minds my rhyme ain't dead yet
I want you to stand up
Put them hands up
I'll break it on down cuz your pumpin' my band up
Like this!! Just like this!! 

[chorus]
Music is key
Its the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin at me 
And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
Its okay cuz its all the way it should be...
The rhymes so insane
Flowin' through your vein
Triggerin the neck poppin nerve up in your brain
I don't even know ya
But came to show ya
The bizkits limp when the night is over
We shake the whole place
Make this earth quake
And it aint fake when we start the riots
So rock the bells
Psycho females doin' time blowin' up the phone lines
Call it a stampede comin' to your town
We aint gonna hold back
We're comin to get down
I want you to stand up
Put them hands up
And break it down cuz your pumpin' my band up
Like this!! Just like this!!

[chorus...chorus]
