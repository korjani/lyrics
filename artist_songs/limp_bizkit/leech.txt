Tell me why ya came, tell me why you're here
Tell me why your voice is always ringing in my ear
You wanna be the man
Hangin with my crew
Who the hell are you though
I see you're always at my shows, always with my bros
Always finding places where I think nobody goes
I can't seem to shake you from this
So now I have to break you from this
Can't you just let me be

Aw, get it straight
Can't you take a hint, thought you had a friend
That's such a shame that you're coming around again
Man I'd really love to take ya out like Chuck Norris
Instead I'd kick 'em with a vocal, slap 'em with a chorus
Man I really shouldn't have to beg
What makes me sick is when your mommy and daddy hit the bed
Oh you seem to not get that picture
So I'll frame this script that i write ya
Can't you just let me be
