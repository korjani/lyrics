i'm dead from all the loneliness this is how i feel understanding everything 
has never been my deal maybe you have crossed my path to live inside of me 
or maybe you're the reason why i'm losing all my decency 
but i believe that you and me we could be so happy 
and free inside a world of misery and i believe that you and me 
we could be so... inside of you inside of me 
cuz this could be the one 
this could be the one
this could be the one
this could be the one 
i've been lookin' lookin, 
lookin' i've been lookin' for my mrs. right 
but she don't exist chemistry is everything 
and we're anything but this maybe i have crossed your path to sweep you off
your feet or maybe i'm the reason why you cry at night 
before you sleep but i believe that you and me 
could be so happy and free inside a world of misery 
and i believe that you and me we could be so...
inside of you inside of me 
cuz this could be the one 
this could be the one
this could be the one 
this could be the one 
what do you think? 
we could give it a try 'cause you never know maybe we could be soul mates 
but maybe not or maybe so 
if you never try then you'll never know the grass could be greener (could be) 
and it'll always be greener on the other side 
but you just never know this could be the one i do believe that you and me 
we could be so happy and free 
inside a world of misery and i believe that you and me, 
we could be so... inside of you inside of me 
'cause this could be the one 
this could be the one 
this could be the one
this could be the one maybe so maybe not who knows?
