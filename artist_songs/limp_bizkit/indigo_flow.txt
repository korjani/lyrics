Yo what up
Got Christian and Dino in the house
Fear Factory action
Kick off this new joint here for all my homies
Separating the true breeds
My friends and my family
Had the vision when the bounds now it's blowing up
Props to the Field Dog
With the funk through the campaign
Gold records and Champaign
Everlast for the tour on St. Patty's
Chino, man we had a blast with ya Deftones
Rock that microphones daily
Props to the maestro
Ross your an angel
Hey DJ wanna play that song
Lethal we love you like a brother
Want to take a trip to the Flip side Jordan
Nothing more then I could say
See ya walking hand in hand with the prophet
Danny you took us to that fat man
Harry, Tyler props for the golden introduction
We're coming from the town of the unknown
Jacksonville's on the map
Look us up
Raising eyebrows with the Jaguars kid
Better watch out
Line 'em up cheetah
(Indigo)
Yo Richard, Rob and Chuck
(Indigo)
Hook it up
When I walk out on stage
All headaches go away
Got the back from the sickest road crew
Chris and Bobby for sticking to it
Sugar Ray taught me life was all about drinking
Bow wow yippee yo yippee yea
To the funk doobi thanks for showing up
All my brothers in KoRn I love you
