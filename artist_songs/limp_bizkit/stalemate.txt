It's not my mind - [5x]
Yo J
And I get a little bit
Your veins flow with poison
Please acknowledge my present
This precious gift that I behold discarded like trash
To dominate, it's in your nature, you selfish brat
I can't believe you had me strung out all over you like that
One minute you're sweet the next minute you're sour
I taste the envious predictions, change with each hour
I've seen this before, you even decided to step into my little world
Strange things occurring
Happening over and
Over and over again
Now bitch you are cruelty
You bark your orders with such a degrading dialect
I can't believe you had me strung out all over you like that
One minute you're sweet the next minute you're sour
I taste the envious predictions, change with each hour
I've seen this before, you even decided to step into my little world
One minute you think you're all this
The next minute you think you're all that
But your playin' with the nova
Momma didn't show ya how to take it, you can by the man
When it's over i'll be hunting you down
Waiting for the pay back, your frown
Begging me for your mercy
I ain't down with the sympathy you see
And I always remember your tender love
Wipe me under the rug
Just so you can step on my spine
I'm gonna get mine - [2x]
Please dont wake me
I'm gonna get mine
I wish I was wasted
I'm gonna get mine
Please dont wake me
I'm gonna get mine
I'd like to rearrange your face
I'm gonna get mine
Please dont wake me
I'm gonna get mine
Please dont wake me
You're so sweet - [3x]
I'm gonna get mine - [3x]
Please dont wake me
I'm gonna get mine
Please dont wake me
I'm gonna get mine
I'll rearrange your face
I'm gonna get mine
I'll rearrange your face
I'm gonna get mine
You're so sweet - [3x]
You're always right and I'm always wrong
Not my mind
That's why I love you so much
Not my mind
You're so sweet
Not my mind
I love you
Not my mind
You're so sweet
Not my mind
I love you
Not my mind...
