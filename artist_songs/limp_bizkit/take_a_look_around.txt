All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'mma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it, ya shit can how we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
Do we always gotta cry
Do we always gotta live inside a lie
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that kid, so what you wanna do
And where you gonna run when you starin' down the cable of a mic
Pointed at your grill like a gun
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set, it's like Russian Roulette
When you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
Cause I'mma be the one till I jet

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason
I don't even know what I should say
Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run
Everybody wanna hide from the gun
You can take that ride through this life if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife, no sir
And now you want your money back
But you're denied cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Now I know why

Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
