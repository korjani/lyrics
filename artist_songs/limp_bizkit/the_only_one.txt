Hold up your movin' too fast 
I'm up for something that last
I ain't looking to screw on the first night 
Cause that's a no go
And if the vibes good, go to first base 
'Cuz the first kiss could be your last taste
I ain't lookin to screw 'till the vibes right

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yea I'm the only one you'll find 
That won't waste all my time, on nothin

Nothin, on nothin, nothin

My will is stronger than most
I will not let you get close
Untill I think you deserve me
Cause that's a no go
I'm gonna hold out, so in the mean time 
Don't expect much from a strong mind 
Untill I think you deserve me

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yea I'm the only one you'll find 
That won't waste all my time

I'm holdin' out, I'm gonna wait
Wanna make it past the first date 
A little time
Then we can do 
All the nasty things you want to 
Don't get me wrong
Just take my hand
And I really hope you understand 
That it's easier when every second counts
So we'll just have to wait

It's really no big deal
It's really no big deal

I'd hate to get you in bed
Find out your empty instead
No need to knock another homerun out
Cause thats a no go

And I'd hate to be so filthy 
If we weren't meant to be
No need to knock another homerun out

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yea I'm the only one you'll find 
That won't waste all my time

On nothin, nothin, on nothin, nothin
On nothin, on nothin
