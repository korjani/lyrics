I got the keys baby, put your mind at ease baby
Go playa, layin' the cheese baby
I know you bitin', bitin' my steez baby
But I came, came to please baby
Don't wait, lay the greeze baby
Don't flake, shake the knees baby
Your fella's mad at me baby, oh well, enemies baby
Who's braggin' they raggin' on me baby?
Who's breath is draggin' on me baby?
Who steps through all agony baby?
Who's checks are bigger than me baby?
Who thinks before it goes down baby?
Who rocks in every town baby?
I don't know if it ain't me
Must be a clone on this microphone baby

[Snoop Dogg:]
Jump in the who ride, slide to the rhythm of
Snoop D-O-double-G, a nigga from the Dub
I represent it to the fullest everywhere I go
Guaranteed to bust a ho, yeah I'm so original
I don't have to, I told you from the get go
I like to lay low with my niggas blowin' endo
We like to drink, talk shit, and spit at bitches
And that's the way we do it, sometimes we hittin' switches
In the lowrider slidin' to the hood and back
It's Snoop Dogg in the muthafuckin' Cadillac
They call it Snoop Deville for real
I get the money and I never ever pop no pills
I used to pop'em, I'm lyin' to these mothafuckaz now
I used to do all kind of shit when I was wild
They used to call me lil' bow wow now I'm big bow wow
In this mothafucka bustin' a freestyle
Snoop Dogg is in the place to see, do it with my nephew, Freddy D
Oohwee, in the place to see
Snoop D-O-double-G from the D.P.G.C

Red light, green light (Red light, green light)

Look who's talkin' it up baby
One more, chalkin' it up baby
Star maps, stalkin' it up baby
My dawgs barkin' it up baby
Who'd a thought I'd be layin' it down baby?
Who'd a thought I'd be turnin' your frown baby?
Never know about things these days baby
Till your cell phone rings and it's me baby
