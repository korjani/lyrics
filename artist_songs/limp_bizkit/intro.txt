Use your vehicle of salvation, my brothers, go buy a gun. 
And go give that gun to Jesus and say 
"Jesus...you go kill the deciples of Satan and you kill the nazis, Jesus.
" Gimme an amen. Amen. 
Gimme a hallelujah, brother. Hallelujah. 
Feel the pain of sweet Jesus. 
Gimme another amen. Amen. 
Gimme another. Amen. 
You've got to kill the noise. 
You've got to kill the pollution of Satan, brother, gimme a hallelujah. Hallelujah. 
Have you been healed? 
Have you been saved? 
Has it happened to you, brother? 
Thank the lord. 
Praise the lord. 
I love Jesus. 
I love Jesus. 
Kill the pollution...pollution
