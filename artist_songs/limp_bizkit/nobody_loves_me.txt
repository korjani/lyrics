Shut up
I'm so sick of them deadlines
I cannot stand why them maniacs are in them headlines
And even though I don't' know ya
Through my lyrics I'll show ya
The sanity's over
Cuz people say I'm bugged out
It's my business, stay the fuck out
All I know is that the beat goes on and on (beat goes on)
And will be the same, 'til the day I'm gone
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms
I'm so sick of the world now
It's all those people attacking my identity
Now the enemy's running at the mouth again
Saddle up when you step into the south, my friend
You're the big one, you're the good one
I'm the bad one, that's so sad son
Cuz I'm running no where
You see the black sheep everywhere
You need to drop that guard
Man, it ain't that hard
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms
Now what's the matter with this
Someone's sure to find me
No exceptions for this (no exceptions)
So many time I fall through
No one has ever warned me
Life seems so meaningless
When ??? your inner strength
Ohh, I'm such a piece of shit
Oh, you're so perfect - [2x]
Oh, you're so much better than me
So much better than me
You suck!
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms
