I seen ya sniffing on my...(On ma, on ma)
Yeah... I seen ya sniffing on my...(On ma, on ma) 

I see ya sniffing my armpit, sniffing on my new shit 
Always got your nose in everybody's business 
Nothing like a two face drama queen, gossip like a magazine
Loose lips sink ships when you ain't a playa 
If you want to talk kid you gotta walk kid
We can have it out kid bring it to the south kid 
Ain't nobody really trying to diss but you been high on my list
AND ITS TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 

(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)

I seen ya sniffing on ma... (On ma, on ma) 

I seen ya sniffing my armpit, sniffing on my stainless
You're a walking bong hit on the verge of brainless
Can't be a big shot, big dog, when you got a broke jaw 
Do yourself a favor: shut your mothafuckin' mouth 
Cuz when your times up there will be people lined up 
Spitting in your face with the five knuckle whined up 
Ain't nobody really trying to diss, but you been high on my list
AND ITS TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 

(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)
Oooohhhhh 
(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)

Trying to live inside a moment
Where the whole world goes away 
A sentimental kind of moment
Where it all just goes away 

Take a walk, take take a walk walk walk walk walk on the wild side [etc.]

Yeah... I seen ya sniffing on my...(On ma, on ma) 
(Wild Wild Wild side)

I seen ya sniffing my armpit, sniffing on my 3rd verse 
You ain't got the hint yet, stay away from Fred Durst 
You don't even know me, you don't know the Bizkit 
Want to get the facts to be straigtened, keep up all the hatin'
If you want to talk kid you gotta walk it 
Artifically keep it comin from your soul kid
Ain't nobody really trying to diss but you been high on my list
AND ITS TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 

(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)
Oooooooohhhhhhhhhh 
(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)

BRING THAT MUTHAFUCKER BACK! 
(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)

Bring that motherfucker back... 
BRING THAT MUTHAFUCKER BACK! 
(Adrenaline)
TIME TO GET THE HOOD OUT 
(My medicine)
