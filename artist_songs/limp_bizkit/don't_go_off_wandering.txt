Everyday is nothing but stress to me 
Constantly dwellin on how you got the best of me
Wanna know somethin 
I cant believe the way you keep testin me 
and mentally molestin me 
But would you think any less of me
if I said that i'd be there
would you think any less of me 
if I said I really cared 
of course you would 
cause you 
only want what you cant have 
as for me 
I'm stuck with my dick in my hand 

[chorus]
because you don't feel nothing at all!! 
you don't feel nothing at all 
Maybe there's more to life then it seems 
I'm constantly runnin from reality chasin' dreams 
Wanna know somethin' I cant believe?
just how much misery
comes with humility
Do you think any less of me 
now that I'm gone? 
look at me now 
everything is gone
I cant seem to do anything right, 
but I've figured out why you don't let me inside 

[chorus]

because you don't feel nothing at all!! 
you don't feel nothing at all 
You need nothin' 
from me now 
So you think
I'm useless to you now 
but I 
need 
one thing from you now 
I 
insist 
that you 
feel me now!! 
you said you needed me
You said 
You said 

[chorus]

because you don't feel nothing at all!! 
you don't feel nothing at all
