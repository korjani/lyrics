1..2..
1..2...what the fuck you gonna do?
You know I see right through you 
you act like you don't know me. 
You lie, you cheat. 
You steal, you lose!! 
wouldn't wanna be in your shoes. 
Always lookin' over your shoulder 
for the ones you stick, 
you sick little prick.
it looks like your times runnin' out. 
I'm creapin' up your back 
so whatcha you all about? 

[chorus]
I'm too fuckin' good,
and fuckin' proud!!
I'm gonna show you how 
bad it hurts 
to be a clown!!
You're the kind of guy with two faces. 
Just another life that's wasted. 
Here's a little fact, 
you do me like that. 
End up in the back 
of my trunk in a sack!! 
you'd better keep your hands off 
what's mine 
and anybody else's. 
When you're selfish 
your wealth is 
all you crave from the cradle to the grave!! 

[chorus]

I'm too fuckin' good,
and fuckin' proud!!
I'm gonna show you how 
bad it hurts 
to be a clown!!
I'm too fuckin' good,
and fuckin' proud!!
I'm gonna show you how 
bad it hurts 
to be a clown!!
I got a little bitty question... 
just what the fuck are you thinkin'?.
You think you're all that and then some?.
well you're not. 
I think you're dum ditty dum!! 
I take it back 
those thoughts are kinda whack. 
Don't really need that kind of karma on the track. 
Maybe freddy krueger 
will step into your dream 
and burn you like a demon
and leave your ass screamin'. 
To be exact I wanted to react. 
Mission of attack. 
Your head was gettin' cracked!! 
but you're a human bein' 
that's lucky to be breathin' 
and that's that!!...
that's that!!...
I don't trust nodboy
and nobody trust me. 
Never gonna trust anybody 
and that's the way its gonna be!!....
I don't trust nobody
cause nobody trust me. 
Never gonna trust anybody 
and that's the way its gonna be!!....
I don't trust nobody
cause nobody trust me. 
Never gonna trust anybody 
and that's the way its gonna be!!....
I don't trust nobody
cause nobody trust me. 
Never gonna trust anybody 
and that's the way its gonna be!!....

[chorus]

I'm too fuckin' good,
and fuckin' proud!!
I'm gonna show you how 
bad it hurts 
to be a clown!! 
I'm too fuckin' good,
and fuckin' proud!!
I'm gonna show you how 
bad it hurts 
to be a clown!!
