I'm so frustrated
Some things are making me so sick inside
Aw go with your heart, go with your heart
Yeah right
Quit tuggin' me
Aw, i'm just not good enough for you
Let's change
Let's be something everybody else is
Aw so much built up inside
It's fucking ridiculous
I don't know if i should freak tha fuck out on you
Or just sit back and laugh
You want more
You don't have anything
Me, me... i have everything
What more could i ask for? Nothing at all
Why did it have to be this way at tha end
