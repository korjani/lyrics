You wanted the worst 
You've got the worst 
The one, the only 
Limp Bizkit 
We could've stopped 
You wanted the best? 
Then don't get the fuckin Backstreet Boys CD! 
Cause in this house it's Limp motherfucking Bizkit! 
Balls made of steel 
But don't hit me in the nuts though 
Limp Bizkit's in the house! 
You ain't shit! 

Guest: Les Claypool (Primus) 
Hit me! 
Fire cracker 

So there you go 
Fifteen of your hard earned dollars, right out the window 
Most epxensive piece of plastic Ive ever come across 
Fifteen dollars 
Fifteen dollars 
On a shoddy piece of plastic 
There is it, Limp Bizkit in all its glory 

Fred Durst, the man, the myth, the compulsive masterbator 

You love him, you hate him, you love to hate him 

Hello? 

Once when I was afraid to speak, when I was just a lad 
My poppy gavew my nose a tweak, and told me I was bad 
Then I learned a brilliant word, saved my aching nose 

The biggest word, that you've ever heard, and this is how it goes 
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 
Even thought he sound of it is something quite atrocious 

Ah, those were the days 
I don't know 
You got any more of that ... 

So what did you think, you were getting a Celine Dion record? 
No no no young bucky 

You laughed, you cried, you just kissed your fifteen bucks goodbye 
Limp Bizkit? I dont think so 
Fred Durst? I dont know 
But what the hell, I got paid 
Goodbye now
