Found my lucky coin in Des Moine

I went from the garage 
to steppin' on these stages. 
Outrageous rhymes left my mind and soon became contagious. 
An mc with bad habits I am. 
I see a mic then I grab it, 
scary aint it? 
comin' raw with no corrections. 
savin' all perfection's 
for what I do with my erections so dream on!!
