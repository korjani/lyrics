I aint no joke
So you should get yourself a pen
And write yourself a little note so you don't forget again
When it comes to cash
I've been gettin' smoked
Lendin' out my money now im broke
Somebody's gettin' choked
Cuz now its time to pay the piper
Bums are the type of shit that are in a diaper
Don't make me have to call a sniper
And wipe your brains off my windshield you dirty bug
As soon as I get paid they come in masses
There's someone givin' classes on kissin' peoples asses
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
Don't even come around here askin' where my cash is!!

[chorus]
Me, I'm broke
Me, I'm broke
I aint no joke
I'll say it once again
If I get provoked there'll be knuckles on your chin
Some people never learn
Borrowin from me you might regret it
For one I aint no bank and you got shitty credit!!
As soon as I get paid they're comin' out the woodwork
Take your ass and get a job like you should jerk
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
But your not so find another spot where the cash is

[chorus]

..Gimme back my money you bum..
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say I'm a slacker
If IM a slacker then its through the eyes of the ones that are blind!!
Me, I'm broke
Poor old me
I'm broke
