I'd say that this is the darkest song I ever wrote
No hint of a smile or the usual quirky anecdote
No this is a song about someone knew what not to say, what not to do
So now I think I'll just be honest.

I hope that no one ever leaves
Cos I don't wanna be alone with me
Not with the things that rush up and down this symphonous spine

Here comes the love anxiety, can't let it grab a hold of me, not after last time

Why do you have to wear skirts and heels like that?
She's blinding anyway but now she's floodlighting up the match. 

Well it's 20 minutes 'til showtime, 
but the backstage is the stage tonight, 
so now, 
I think I'll just be honest. 

I hope that no one ever leaves, 
'cause I don't wanna be alone with me, 
not with the things that rush up and down this symphonous smile. 

Here comes the love anxiety, 
can't let it grab a hold of me, 
not like the last time. 

Here comes the love anxiety, 
it's gonna grab a hold of me, 
just like the last time
