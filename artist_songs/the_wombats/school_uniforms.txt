It all started on the school bus, 
You were 9 and I was 10, 
Remember you had a Walkman, 
All I had was a middle part and a pen 

Oh sweet Louise, 
Whatever happened to her? 

Then is all went downhill, 
You grew tall I stayed the same, 
I guess that's just puberty, 
Making us boys all play a losing game 

Oh sweet Louise 

I always found it hard to work things through, 
Those school uniforms made a joke, 
Made a joke of me and you, 
I'm glad I'm not back in school 

She got an older boyfriend (how could she?) 
Had a beard, 
Smoked Marlboro red, 
How can I compete with that? (how can he?) 
I don't even know the location of the bike sheds 

Oh sweet Louise 

I always found it hard to work things through, 
Those school uniforms made a joke, 
Made a joke of me and you, 
I always found it hard to work things through, 
Those school uniforms made a joke, 
Made a joke of me and you 

I remember short skirts, 
Long hair, 
My hormones flying everywhere 

I always found it hard to work things through, 
Those school uniforms made a joke, 
Made a joke of me and you, 
I always found it hard to work things through, 
Those school uniforms made a joke, 
Made a joke of me and you 

I'm glad I'm not back in school
