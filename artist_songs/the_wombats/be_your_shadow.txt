Tonight we'll both go M.I.A
In different towns but in similar ways
I've tried my best, best to forget
But I can't, I can't, I can't

Tonight we'll scratch each other's face
If it's in the moment no one complains
I tried my best to move along
But I can't, I can't, I can't

Kiss me with your fist it's all right
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just wanna be your shadow

Just one more uptempo tune
The suits don't care if their feet aren't blue
Are you aware of what's going on
In my heart, my heart, my heart
Those machine gun eyes, they fire crystals into me
You're such a violent high
And I'm such a loose cannon can't you see?

Kiss me with your fist it's all right
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just wanna be your shadow

Have a bus drive it over my rib cage
Snap my bank cards and throw them at my face
I'm permanent now I won't go
I just wanna be your shadow

And I just want to be the sum of your broken parts
And I just want to be your creature of the dark
And I just want to be the sum of your broken parts
And I just want to be your creature of, your creature of the dark

I just wanna be your shadow

Kiss me with your fist it's all right
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just wanna be your shadow
