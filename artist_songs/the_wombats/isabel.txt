Two tickets to the rabbit hole, please
I gave them half my earnings and all they gave me was this suite
She's fuelling up whilst talking down to me
God you must be the biggest caner this whole world has ever seen
Take what you want from me, Isabel

Isabel, you make it feel as though I've won and the dullest parts may never come
Isabel, I'm much better Isabel
When you're ripping my life apart
I think it's you that's the true rock star around here

It must be the oxygenated air
That keeps my confidence rising and keeps my mind without a care
And as Nights in White Satin hits its peak
You grab me by the collar and whisper what's in store for me,
Do what you will to me, Isabel

Isabel, you make it feel as though I've won and the dullest parts may never come
Isabel, I'm much better Isabel
When you're ripping my life apart
I think it's you that's the true rock star around here

So tell me sweetheart, did they teach you all of this in a school, love?
In a school, around here?
Because I'm out my depth now, you can't leave me all alone in this bed
Covered in your sweat and my fear
I could do with keeping you near
I could do with keeping you, Isabel

Isabel, you make it feel as though I've won and the dullest parts may never come
Isabel, I'm much better Isabel
When you're ripping my life apart
I think it's you that's the true rock star around here

Around here
Around here
Around here
