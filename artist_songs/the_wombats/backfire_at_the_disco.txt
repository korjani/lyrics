It`s 8`o clock and im feeling fine im out on a date tonight in a candle lit resturant down by the river side
Everything's going alright I guess 
She took down my number and home address 
Everything was going perfectly until... 

It backfired at the disco, she slapped me at the disco, I did something I'll never forget 

It was a chat-up line built not to impress 
More a sleazy remark on her whorish dress 
My wires crossed like they've never done before 
Well it's 3 o' clock and I'm feeling shite 
I'm going home alone tonight 
everything was going perfectly until...

It backfired at the disco, she slapped me at the disco 
I did something I'll never forget 
It backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the disco 
I made a move when it was well out of context 

It backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the disco 
It backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the disco 
Yeah, it backfired at the disco, when she slapped me at the disco 
It backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the disco
