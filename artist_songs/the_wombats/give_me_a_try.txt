I know that I like to let excess succeed
But I just need you in that fur coat
With only my necklace on underneath
And I don't care why this apartment's always cold
London can try, it'll never swallow me whole

And I swear,

We could be gigantic, everything I need
Vicodin on Sunday nights
This could be worth the risk, worth the guarantee
This could be the drug that doesn't bite
Just give me a try
Just give me a try
Been kind of hoping you might
Get up and give me a try

I know, sometimes I lose the plot and I cause a scene
What do you dream of on the west coast
When my head is aching in GMT
And I don't care why this apartment's so ice cold
Let London try, it'll never swallow me whole

And I swear,

We could be gigantic, everything I need
Vicodin on Sunday nights
This could be worth the risk, worth the guarantee
This could be the drug that doesn't bite
Just give me a try
Just give me a try
Been kind of hoping you might
Get up and give me a try

I'm shaving with your toothpaste
And trying to vacuum from the ceiling
The millisecond that you're away
I get the loneliest feeling

Just give me a try

And I swear,
I swear,

We could be gigantic, everything I need
Vicodin on Sunday nights
This could be worth the risk, worth the guarantee
This could be the drug that never bites
Just give me a try
Just give me a try
Been kind of hoping you might
Get up and give me a try
Give me a try

Just give me a try
Just give me a try
