I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
Something’s making that snow look so inviting
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
I miss the safety of home but perhaps this is what I need
Perhaps this is what I need

From all the laugh and scratch bars that de-value our cards with a smile
From all the a-listed stars that crush our weak hearts with their style
We’re young, we’re free, we’re ultimately in denial
That we’ll never get the flash car that does forty gallons to the mile

What’s left to lose?
Were you the search or rescue?

I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
Something’s making that snow look so inviting
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
I miss the safety of home but perhaps this is what I need
Perhaps this is what I need

From all the footballers’ wives that provide only sighs and a view
From all the cringe-worthy nights where we break down and cry for the rue
We’re young, we’re free, we’re ultimately out our minds
That we never get what we want without hard work and big compromise

I’m not bitter all the time
I don’t punch at airbags when there’s nothing left to fight.

I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
Look at that snow, are you seeing what I see?
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
Rushing towards me!

I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
Something’s making that snow look so inviting
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me
I miss the safety of home but perhaps this is what I need
Perhaps this is what I need
