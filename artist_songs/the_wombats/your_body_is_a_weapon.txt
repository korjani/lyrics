Sometimes I like to go uptown
Where flashy people flash around
It's extortionate and I don't care
You can taste the pretense in the air

And I wonder what you wear tonight
The shiny black dress with the slit at the thigh
Is this such fantasy that I should think
Someone like you could love a creep like me

Your body is a weapon, love
And it makes me wanna cry
My body is a temple of doom
Doomed not to be by your side

I like my job when I do it well
It's freelance work and it pays like hell
But I could get us a place with one bedroom
Who needs a friend when I've got you

Your body is a weapon, love
And it makes me wanna cry
My body is a temple of doom
Doomed not to be by your side

And I don't come here for the exclusivity
I just come here for the view
And the minuscule chance of some close proximity
Or an awkward conversation with you
Yeah that'd be cool

Your body is a weapon, love
And it rips me up inside
My body is a temple of doom
Doomed not to be
Doomed not to be by your side

Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I, one I love

Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I, one I love

Someone protect me from the one I love
Someone protect me from the one I love
From the one I, one I love
