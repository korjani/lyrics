They say love can take you far
Be your self and there you are
Once in a lifetime when will she be mine, heaven knows
Love can take you
Up the mountains, down below 
Day or night she won't let go,
Love like a warm wind
Sworn to the feelin'
Need to know

What does it feel like, when can I say
It's the furthest I've ever been and I found a way 
What does it sound like, when will I know,
How does it feel like, letting go, 
A memory of - I only know how to love

When I dream I'm in her arms
Feeling safe and far from harm 
She knows where I've been, places that I've seen, I need to know

Heaven tell me 

What does it feel like, when can I say 
It's the furthest I've ever been and I found a way
What does it sound like, when will I know, 
How does it feel like, letting go,
A memory - I only know how to love

Deep down inside she's here tonight by my side

What does it sound like, when will I know 
How does it feel like, letting go
A memory - I only know how to love 

I only know how to love
