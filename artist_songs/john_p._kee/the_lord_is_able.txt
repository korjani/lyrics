Now that it's over, hold your head up high
Just be encouraged, hold your head up to the sky
Every one of your obstacles, you can overcome
Shout Hallelujah for the battle's already won

There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper
He's able to keep you, the same shall free you
He's able to see you, see you through

Now that it's over, hold your head up high
Just be encouraged, hold your head up to the sky
Every one of your obstacles, you shall overcome
Shout Hallelujah for the battle's already won

There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper
He's able to keep you, the same shall free you
He's able to see you, see you through

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities
For we know deep in our hearts, He shall not, He won't forsake me
There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper

He's able to keep you
The same shall free you
He's able to see you

So lift up your head so God can use you
And He will come to your rescue
If you draw nigh to God
It's true that He will draw nigh to you

He's able to keep you
The same shall free you
He's able to see you

The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able

The Lord is able
The Lord is able

Through the storm and rain
Through sickness and pain
When your friends are few
The Lord will take care of you

The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able

The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able
The Lord is able

Through the storm and rain
Through sickness and pain
When your friends are few
The Lord will take care of you

The Lord is able
