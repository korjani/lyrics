I'm living this life just to live again
And with the Lord I know that I shall reign
I shall not stray...with Him I'll stay
He'll welcome His children home one day
Like a thief in the night He shall return for me
That's the day that He'll come and fly away
You'll see
Jesus will welcome me home

I shall see Him for myself
I shall meet Him in the air
(After the dead in Christ shall rise, we that are still alive)
Jesus will welcome me home

He'll welcome me (He'll welcome me) [Repeat]

Welcome [2x]
Welcome my
Welcome my good and faithful servant

He'll welcome, yes He'll welcome
He'll welcome, yes He'll welcome me [Repeat]

Jesus will welcome me
Jesus will welcome me
Jesus will welcome me home
