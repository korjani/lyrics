Oh Lord, I can't live
There is no life without you
You're the source of my being
On your arms I am leaning
I can't live without you

Oh Lord, I can't live
There is no life without you
You're the source of my being
On your arms I am leaning
I can't live without you

Brought me a mighty long way
It was your love that sought me
An awesome price you paid

You're the source of my being
On your arms I am leaning
I can't live without you

It was your love that taught me
Brought me a mighty long way
It was your love that sought me
An awesome price you paid

You're the source of my being
On your arms I am leaning
I can't live without you

Without your grace, your mercy
Just can't make it
