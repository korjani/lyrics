[Verse 1]
When you see me come around
I got you looking at me (got you looking at me)
I don’t need to spend my cash
Cos my swag’s not hard to see
Cos my swag don’t lie
You can’t deny
You feeling right yeah
You’ll be alright just being by my side

[Hook 2x]
No need for fronting (fronting girl)
Let me tell you something (something girl)
No need for long thing, cos you feel so good just standing by my side

[Chorus 2x]
If you see me drive by...holla at your boy
I got more swag..holla at your boy
I pop more bottles...holla at your boy
Chilling with models...holla at your boy

[Verse 2]
Hey girl
You got me thinking...there’s many things I can do to you
Hey girl
You got me wishing...I could take you home with me
Lets take one step at a time, 2 by noon
Be my girl, with you I rule
You are fresh and fly, don’t deny
Nothing feels better

[Hook 2x]

[Chorus 3x]

[Bridge]
If you up tonight and you feeling alright, holla at your boy (holla at your boy)
Your jeans sag low your fresh fly boy, holla at your boy (holla at your boy)
If you up tonight and you feeling alright, holla at your boy (holla at your boy)
You are a pretty fine girl and you got no boy, holla at your boy (holla at your boy)

No need for fronting (fronting girl)
Something (something girl)
Long thing, cos you feel so good just standing by my side

No need for fronting (fronting girl)
Something (something girl)
Long thing, cos you feel so good just standing by my side

[Repeat chorus till fade]
