It’s your boy Wizzy.. yea
And I am repping Emeazy.. yea
Yea oohhh oohhh
Maybe it was a dream but I know once we’ve been together
Girl I showed you love
You chose to promise me forever
I no go lie, I no be the type to scope you
I don give you my heart
Baby girl I will love you

[Hook]
I think I met you before girl
You light up my world girl
You must be a super star
I wanna know who you are
I wanna be where you are (where you are, where you are)

[Chorus]
It’s true the girls they love me why me
Baby I swear na you dey high me
Forget the girls they just try me
Baby I swear na you dey high me
It’s true the girls they love me why me
Baby I swear na you dey high me
Forget the girls they just try me
Baby I swear na you dey high me

[Bridge]
The way you whine a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You move a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You sexy a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You whine a (Oshe…baby na you dey high me)
The way you whine a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You move a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You sexy a (Oshe…say na you dey high me)
You whine a (Oshe…baby I swear na you dey high me)

[Repeat chorus]
