Oh nananana
Eh eh
In the early 90s
That was the beginning
Mama had me
She was definitely smiling
Finally a boy
She was very very happy
She prayed for those with the love of her life eh
She called me grace
She called me blessing
She looked into my eyes
Called me love of her life
I wish i could go back and feel what she felt
But she goes on her knees
And tell God what she felt eh 

Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy
Showers of blessings
God blessed her plenty
Thank God for blessing
Love of my life eh
Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy
We didn’t have much
She loved me still
When she thank God for blessing love of my life eh 

When I was a little boy
Mama told me
My boy chase your dreams
And keep believing
And the sky will be your beginning
When I was a little boy
Mama told me
My boy chase your dreams
And keep believing
And your peak will be your beginning 

When I was a little boy
Mama told me
Love will set you free
My boy please believe it
Cos this love is for real
When I was a little boy
Mama told me
My boy chase your dreams
And keep believing
And the love will set you free
