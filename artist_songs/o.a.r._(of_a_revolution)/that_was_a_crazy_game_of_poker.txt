Ohh myyyy
20 throw down in my fist of rage
and the man to my left has folded down
well Johnny doubled up with a royal flush
I had three jacks and a pair of nines
my mind is turning - just two shots more
there's not much left to play
Then dude walks in Black hat on top, what a mop
I'm lucky it wasn't a county cop
'Cause I'm just running out of time

Who's up for game two
what to do
my wallet's gettin' thin
and I just lost my watch last night
well I gotta problem
just one answer
gotta throw it all down
and kiss it goodbye
Yeah!

That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
but someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fall.
(never to fall)

Who's up for game three
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me
And I just lost it all
well there's a man sittin' next to me
Red with smiling eyes
It's funny
I don't have no money tonight
yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh

That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
but someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fall.
(never to fall)

Bop bop bop...
I say now skittleedat dat,
Well how 'bout that?
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back

And I walked into the bar yesterday
'Cause I had something to do, something to say
And Johnny walked in right behind me and I didn't turn around
'Til I heard the sound of his feet falling on the ground
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah
Jahova!

And I said, whatcha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go
So he opened the door and said do what you're here for
I said I'm wandering 'round the road four to four
And I said I been walking for about a thousand years.

And my feet are growing tired
My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die dah dah
Day day oh!

I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop
Don't give a shit 'cause I got the drop
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine

And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same
I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me

And to my left was a man, he had no chin
Didn't really think about starting to sin
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Because I took his money last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling--
I need a honey-bunny.
I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah jahova
jahova, is watching over me...
Day day oh!
