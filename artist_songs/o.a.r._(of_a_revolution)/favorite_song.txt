Here's my attempt to desribe
How you make me feel so alive
I'll break it down one time
So listen line by line

Listen line by line
Listen line by line

You're my Stairway to Heaven, you're Freddy Mercury
You've got a License to Ill, and girl it worked for me
You're Johnny Cash singing to a penitentiary
You're Graceland, The Band, and Petty falling free

You're Stir it Up, yeah you're Jamming, you're my Redemption Song
I'm Knocking on Heaven's Door and you're Forever Young
I'm just a kid in the stand waiting for the show
I clap my hands

Cause you're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
And it goes like this

Well It's a Beautiful Day and we were Born to Run
I might have 99 Problems but you were never one
I'm hearing Yellow this Mellow Mood is all around
You're London Calling, The clash, and I Won't Back Down

I Imagine the Blackbird is flying high
So Let it Be, i can feel it coming In the Air Tonight
I'm just a kid with my headphones up to ten
Play it again

You're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
You're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
Yeah, it goes like this

You're my Fire and Rain, you're Rolling in the Deep
You're state of mind's in the city that really never sleeps
A bad mama, no drama, you're Mary J to me
You're my Mariah with notes higher than anything

But you were hear, the Tears in Heaven don't know why
I didn't come any sooner you're Wonderful Tonight
So I'll just stand 'til the band plays an encore
Give me some more

You're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
You're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
You're my favorite song
My favorite song
You're my favorite song
