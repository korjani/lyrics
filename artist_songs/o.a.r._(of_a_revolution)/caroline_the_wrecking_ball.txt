There something about the way we fall apart
Like everything that matters, didn’t matter from the start
Everyone around us played a part
Wrecking ball came crashing through the window
Structures that we carry in our heart

And all I ever asked of you
Is just to be the woman that you wanted to
It’s all I ever asked

Just outside the city on a Sunday last July
The girl’s name was Brandy but we called her Caroline
No one even knew her history
Said she came from somewhere in the southland
Feels like she was coming straight for me

I was playing nine ball with two guys I knew from work
This junkie local starts acting like a jerk
Saw him put his hand up Brandy’s skirt
And I don’t know what happened next
In retrospect I lost my head and think I went berserk

By the time they pulled me off him I was almost coming to
Bleeding at the knuckles, she says nice to meet you
And the cops will probably be here in a flash
We hailed a cab we both got in
And watched that taxi driver slam his foot down on the gas

Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
But I ain’t nobody’s fool

Next few months we spent a lot of time up in the room
Laughed a lot, drank a lot, yeah we tried to shoot the moon
And in the morning time she'd always disappear
I agreed, I'd never ask her questions
With the chance of an answer I don't wanna hear

One morning, she crying on the stoop outside my place
She tryin’ to hide it, there’s sadness on her face
Oh is there anything I can do?
She said perhaps if you would drop this package off
I would hate to inconvenience you

Well they say a suckers born, every sixty seconds time
I knew I shouldn't do it, but I put it from my mind
And, oh if you knew that gal of mine
You’d understand, I got no hand in making that decision
Reason got no rhyme

Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
But I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's fool no more

I knocked at the address that she gave waited for a few
Looked inside the window and I saw a kid or two
Next thing I knew a burner in my face
There's just some shit you never can erase

Both my hands were shaking as the sun began to rise
I got back to my house, she was gone I'm not surprised
You can never ground a bird that needs to fly
Oh I got into that urge to move
Thanks to you, my wrecking ball Caroline

Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with you
But I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's fool no more
No more
