It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady running through my head
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I know this lady, way down in my country
She was so pretty thet my eyes threw disguises at me
An we would sit and wonder 'bout the future
But now i'm thinkin' that today sounds fine to me
Well i've been working for days on full time
I've got no money but everything is goin' fine
But i've been tired in my head,
said i've been tired in my head...

It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady running through my head
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed

I know this lady with eyes as blue as the sea
Now she would sit and stare directly through me
And that laugh would take me to the future
Throughout the past, there was nothing left for me
But i've been working for days on full time
I've got no money but everything is goin' fine
But i've been tired in my head
Said i've been tired in my head...

Its 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady runnin' through my head
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed.....

Its 3 a.m., I wanna go to bed
I got a lady running through my head
Ran outta money, i'm lookin for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed [x2]

Wanna go to bed...
wanna wanna go to go to bed...
wanna wanna wanna go to bed....
