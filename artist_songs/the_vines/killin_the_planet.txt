I can not sleep for the sound of the sirens
Ignorant bliss to a world we’re denying
Killin the planet yeah, so well

Look at the earth and you see that it’s dying
People the curse cause we keep multiplying
Killin the planet yeah, so well
Killin the planet yeah, oh well

Cause it’s always, it’s always the way
We forget how we lived yesterday
Now we’re always, we’re always around
To affect everything we surround

I can not see for the sight of the building
Or out to sea for the oil we are spilling
Killin the planet yeah, so well

What will we do when the earth cannot hide it
All of the waste and the way we defy it
Killin the planet yeah, so well
Killin the planet yeah, oh well

Cause it’s always it’s always the way
We forget how to give so we take
Now we’re always, we’re always around
To be here but it’s all coming down
