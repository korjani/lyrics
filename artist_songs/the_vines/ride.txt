That's the start, the middle, and the end
Aren't you glad the universe pretends
If I don't get this message home
Once again I'm gonna hate alone
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me, Oh
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me unless you 

Bored aloud ignore the right to be
Invite me down because we like to see
The colours through your loaded mind
Fuck the world and liberate our time 

Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me, Oh
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me, Yeah

I'm not waiting a long life
I'm not waiting alone 

Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me home
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me home
