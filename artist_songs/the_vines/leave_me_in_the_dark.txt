Leave me in the dark
Cryin at the moon
Everybody in a hurry
Without any clue

There is a feelin that I get around you
There is a feelin that I get alone honey

They got no reason that they get to hurt you
Cause everybody got a right to live honey

Leave me in the dark
Cryin at the moon
Everybody in a hurry
Without any clue

Leave me in the dark
Leave me in the dark
