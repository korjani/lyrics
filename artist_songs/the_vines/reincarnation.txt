Round and around and around in the neon
Round and around and around here we go
Round and around and around in the neon
Round and around and around don’t ya know

It takes seven days to leviate the strain
Before you start again
Time it never ends

Round and around and around in the neon
Round and around and around here we go
Round and around and around in the neon
Round and around and around ya should know

There’s far too many ways to mediate the pain
Before you count to ten
Time it never ends
