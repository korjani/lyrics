I hear the sound
Comin' up
Goin' down

Danger in the hollow
Sewer on the side
Waitin' for the morrow
Dope to get ya by

See for a mile
What I mean
To decide

Danger in the hollow
Sewer on the side
Waitin for the morrow
Dope to get ya by

You're forever dreamin'
And forever bored
Everything ya needed
I just cold ignore
