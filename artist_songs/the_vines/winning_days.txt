The winning days are gone
Because I know just where I'm seeing
Was given eyes I know
I can hear
Cause underneath there's gold
I need to get around to find it
And when I want to go
I can dream
I've been trying
All my time

I'm just seeing it rise
Cause it could be the land that's over me
So I just wanna let it breathe

Get up and go outside
It can help your mind too
Get up don't hide away

Cause I know where there's gold
(Get up and go outside)
I didn't know when I was flying
(It can help your mind too)
I'm sinking like a stone
(Get up don't hide away)
I can dream
I've been trying...
