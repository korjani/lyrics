Tell me where you’re goin’
I’ve already seen the other side
It’s all I know and nothin now can do me right, I pray

Lonely as the days I knew, babe
Tired of feelin strange and blue

Phone me in the morning
Count on me to let you down without a word or warning
I’ll be gone and living far away

Lonely as the days I knew, babe
Would I be O.K round you?

Sha, la, la, la

Tell me what you know and I will see if it rings truth
My mind is overflowin
I believe that we all meet again
