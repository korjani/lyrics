Don't listen to the radio
Hear something that ya ready know
I got no radio

Don't speak upon the telephone
Hear somethin' that you're never shown
I got no telephone

Get out the way today
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today
(Oh yeah I say)

Don't listen to the TV show
Feel someone that you ready know
I got no T.V.O

Get out the way today
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today
(Oh yeah I say)
