I don't know how the future started
We might as well all be retarded
Cut from an image turned to stone
Makin' me feel it to the bone

Deep in the jungle or Sahara
Real people carry on regardless
Left unaffected left alone
The sun, the earth, the moon their home

In the beginning
Or the old days
Surreal lives and mine are strange
Oh yeah I say
It's like futuretarded

C'mon baby don't say
C'mon baby don't mind
Every night every day
Everything will be right
