Anything you say now, darling, is gonna be the way we want it
Living in a sea of morons I don’t wanna see them go on (everyday)

Ah, Live by the music, live by the music

Anything you say now darling, is gonna be the truth they’ll promise
Even though they never mean it, they don’t wanna know your secret (anyway)

Ah, Live by the music live by the music
