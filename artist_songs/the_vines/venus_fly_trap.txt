She’s like a venus fly trap
Hunted your soul
Why did you need her so bad?
To lose control

Life is all I need
Life is all there is
Why go on trying something not for me?

He’s like the meanest wise crack
You’ll never know
Demean and make you feel so sad
And never show

Life is all you need
Life is all there is
Why go on lying? You will not forgive

She’s like a venus fly…
