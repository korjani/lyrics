There is one thing that I know now for sure
I don’t need to alone now no more
‘Cause you are the girl I want
I love you more than the sun
I’ll be with you every day now
I will Then you’ll realise my love no for real
‘Cause you are the girl I want
I love you more than the sun
I don’t really know just what it means
But you are the girl that I want
Alright babe yeah
