I left my home 
I left my home yeah, yeah 
Where I should go 
Where I should go yeah, yeah 

Nothin's gonna save you 
Nothin's gonna save you out there 

Went on my own 
Went on my own yeah, yeah 
Without my phone 
Without my phone yeah, yeah 

Nothin's gonna save you 
Nothin's gonna save you out there 
Nothin's gonna save you 
Nothin's gonna save you or give 

I can see the leaves of golden glisten in the sun 
Making time for everyone is what I should have done. 
Blue and green with eyes between are acting all the same 
You and me are never free until we're cast away 

But it really doesn't matter couldn't change it if I tried 
Though it really doesn't matter 
I'll do it till I get it right
