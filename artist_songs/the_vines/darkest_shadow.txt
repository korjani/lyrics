Got no memory so I don’t mind it
In the darkest shadow I’ve been hidin
Now the time has come for me to start again
Chase the meaning and the demon from my bed

Mary wanna mary go
Turn my heart now
Into stone
See her love and see her low
Mary wanna take me home

Got no synergy so I don’t like it
In the darkest shadow I decided that the time had come for me to start again
Every rhyme I’ve sung will leave you now for dead
