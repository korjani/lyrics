Days are long but the minds are strong 
In the factory 
Heads are down and all the people frown 
In the factory 
I'm so down I put my head around every noose I see 
Days are long but the minds are strong 
In the factory 

Eyes are mean but the walls are clean 
In the factory 
Patience now they're gonna string you out 
In the factory 
I'm so tired I never go outside every night I sleep 
Days are long but the minds are gone 
In the factory
