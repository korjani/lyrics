Straight from the heart
To buy, you look like nothing's up
Where the air labors your mind
You look the part

Too bad, I'm nothin' ever too
Where the air labors your mind
Who are we to bring the fire down?
Who are we supposed to please?
When you're friggin' round all of me
To something that I say
For your fire, yeah that sounds great
And I got a friend

It's whatever you wanna be
Now, you're alone and it's up to me
You get to be
More strung out than you thought you'd be
