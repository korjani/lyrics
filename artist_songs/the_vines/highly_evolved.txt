I'm feelin happy 
So highly evolved 
My times a riddle that'll never be solved 
Dreamin for somethin 
Reachin for somethin 
Just waitin for the sun to carry me in 

If you feel low 
You can buy love 
From a payphone 
I don't feel low 

My brother Bill 
He work for the market 
Life is an arrow now and he is the target 
Dreamin for somethin 
Reachin for somethin 
Just waitin for the sun to carry me in 

If you feel low 
You can buy love 
From a payphone 
I don't feel love 

Highly evolved 

I don't feel low
