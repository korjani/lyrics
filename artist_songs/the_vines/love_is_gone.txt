Say to me
Say to me
Say to me nothin’ wrong
Say to me

Say to me love is gone

Oh no ya life is a nuisance
Been weighin’ on my head
So down but I found a new song
Keep playing on my bed

Say to me 
Say to me 
Say to me nothin’ wrong 
Say to me 
Say to me 
Say to me love is gone

Love is gone yeah
Love is gone yeah
Love is gone yeah

Oh no ya wife doesn’t make sense
No time for what she said
So down but you found a new song
We’ll play until we’re dead

Love is gone yeah
Love is gone yeah
Love is gone yeah

Say to me 
Say to me 
Say to me 
Say to me 
Love is gone
