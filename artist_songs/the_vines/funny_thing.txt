I want you now
Come clear the cloud
Be like the same
Share life today
Yeah, but the funny thing Is that it hurts me most
No matter what I sing, no matter what I know
Yeah, it’s a funny thing kill ya self today
‘Cause tonight it will hurt
Though ya not to blame
Like the sun you still burn
I know what it takes
But I threw it out
To be worlds away
On a wicked sound
