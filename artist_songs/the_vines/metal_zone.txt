I met her on Monday
She looked like a God
And threw back in my face
My love now I'm gone

Stoned
In my metal zone
I take rock 'n' roll
To get radical

I'm not goin insane
I just need more fun
But dear going your way
I do what I want

Stoned
In my metal zone
I take rock 'n' roll
To get radical

Can you get it? [x8]

I've been tryin to find you
You keep movin ahead
Once could never deny you
Now I wish you were dead
