in the jungle you can sleep 
with the commandments at your feet 
where the devil lays his hand 

you don't even need to think 
I'm tearin holes without a sink 
but I know just where I stand 

lines from the story you put before me 
I don't know what to choose 
under the oak tree tin all around me 
I don't know what to prove 

yeah she felt you felt like hell 

in the jungle you're in the jungle 
you're in the jungle that's you 
in the jungle you're in the jungle 
you're in the jungle ooooooohhh 

and I'll be waitin for a hit yeah 
ain't gonna seem fair tonight 
and I'll keep havin other fits yeah 
because it makes me feel alright 
alright alright ooohhh ooohhh yeah right ooohhh ooohhh yeah 
so if you should need a hand 
write down the address of the land 
but I'm runnin out of time 

I'll tell you when it's time to leave 
you're never gonna get clean
