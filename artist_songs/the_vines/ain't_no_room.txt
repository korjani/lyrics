There ain't no room for me in the city 
The lights go down but it looks so pretty 
So take me away from the corner 
Let me hide away in the fauna 
With something at my side 

Forget it now forget it then 
We'll hang around without a care 

There ain't no room for me in the city 
The lights go down but it looks so pretty 
So take me away from the corner 
Let me hide away in the fauna 
With something at my side 

Going outta my head 
Was it something I read 

Forget it now 
Forget it then 
We'll hang around without a care
