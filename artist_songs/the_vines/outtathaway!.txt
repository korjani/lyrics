I get 
What I own 
Don't let 
The feelings that I choose 
'Cause everybody else do 

Gotta get outtathaway! 
No time for me to stay 
Everyone in the world dont affect you 

We think 
You're a lot different 
Your number ain't your thing 
Your life is on the wrong end 

Gotta get outtathaway! 
No time for me to stay 
Everyone in the world dont affect you 

C'mon 
C'mon 
C'mon 

Gotta get outtathaway! 
No time for me to stay 
When I speak out of line 
I don't believe in time
