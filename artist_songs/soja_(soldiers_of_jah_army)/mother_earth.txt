[Verse 1:]
They should have know this couldn't last forever
They should have known this cannot last so long
And yes they should of known when we go murder our mother
The consequence from the father is going to be strong

[Chorus:]
I know, I know only love will stand
Well the wickedness come, wickedness go
Only love will stand

[Verse 2:]
They should have seen when we go raping
Our mother Earth who was so fresh and green
That what we gonna give will be what we getting
And what we sow will be what we reap
If you take the blood out from her vein
Things they never ever gonna be the same
Who will repair who will bear the blame
For the cost of this dangerous Babylon game

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
They should have known Soldier would come
And spread the message, they should have known
The righteous won't sit and watch
They should have known I work for the father
I will defend my mother, they should have known
But know they did not.

InI know only love will stand
