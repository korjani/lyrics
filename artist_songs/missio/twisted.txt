My mother, she told me
"Don't get in trouble"
My father, he told me
He knew I would.
My brothers, they told me
"Don't give a damn"
My sister, she told me
to do something good.

I'm uncontrollable, emotional, chaotically proportional,
I'm visceral, reloadable
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted

My mother, she told me
"Don't be a quitter"
My father, he told me
He knew I was.
My brothers, they told me
"Do what you do"
My sister, she told me
to do something good.

I'm uncontrollable, emotional,
chaotically proportional,
I'm visceral, reloadable
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted

My mother, she told me...
My father, he told me...
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
