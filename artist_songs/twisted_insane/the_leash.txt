Everybody know my story and my glory, used to sleep in the street
Holes up in my clothes and broken shoes up on my feet
Never had no time to pay attention to your beef
But if you feelin' froggy, won't you go ahead and leap
Live with a demon and I see him every time I go to sleep at night
Kids tell me they're hungry, what the fuck is they gon' eat tonight?
People lookin' at me like I'm not there
Nobody ever believed in me
I'm deceased to everybody, rest in peace tonight
I'm your nigga that you ride goin' wit' ya
I bet you feelin' like a fucking cyclone hit ya
I really try to get to fuckin' my chrome lit up
I mean it I was in it like a styrofoam sipper
I got demons talkin' to me weighin' heavy on my soul
Weighin' down my actions like the monkey on my back
Someone hold my bottle while I fire off the bowl
Takin' a hit of the green and releasin' my semen, I'm tryna just relax
But people becomin' so negative, always offend you to laugh and
To pin you up, they better give it up
I kept pushin' with the devil in my head
I sit up on the floor and keep on starin' at the razor-blades
And thinkin' to myself that it'd be better if I'm dead
Not knowin' if I'll be around to see another year or two
Every time I think about my life, I need a beer or two
Most the time I wish I was invisible
And I ain't scared of no one just in case you niggas think that I be fearing you
So faded up off of the drink that you would think I'm off of lean
Niggas use they bitches, sit and wish the phone would ring
I always used to wish one day that I'd become a king
Puttin' my life in the hands of no one but myself and I'll be free
Don't make music for the critics, I make music for the fans
They're the ones who standin' with me by my side and let me know
Other people tell me that they're really happy if I made it
If you really wanna see me fly then won't you help me go up off the leash

Back one more time for the niggas thinkin' I was a done deal
Had to come back for one more spin on that fun wheel
Hit 'em up with like one more claps
Time, get up in the mind of your kind, you will find every gun's real
Nigga this shit's unreal, my son could've been with you
Ridin' up in the back seat when the hollow tips just missed you
On fire when the vampire bit you
Ain't nowhere for you to run, fuck your gun when that demon come get you
So many nights I spend awake, I don't sleep much
Faded in the hallway at like three in the morning
Lookin' at the mirror screamin' at the motherfucka that's lookin' back at me
Throw the bottle in it, break it, goddammit I'm zonin'
Wake up, don't remember shit, I do it every time
All I see is bottles all around, they just surround me on the ground
A nigga head is poundin' and I feel I'm drownin' and I'm down and out
Because a nigga fresh up out the County
Need to hook up, get my head out my ass
Get up off the couch, I need to get my own shit
Got up out the pen' and made a way all by myself
And jumped up in the studio and made a song called "Dome Split"
I was killin' niggas
Movin' all around this here country
I was livin' on the Greyhound with a 40 bottle and some lunch meat
Dumping on any motherfucker tryna run up and pump me
Bumpy Johnson nigga, it's not 21 Jump Street
Dreams of playin' sold out arenas
Wishin' that my granddaddy seen us
I am a pure wicked genius
Brain is lost somewhere on Venus
No music for the critics, I make music for the fans
They're the ones who standin' with me by my side and let me know
Other people tell me that they're really happy that I made it
If you really wanna see me fly then won't you help me go up off the leash
