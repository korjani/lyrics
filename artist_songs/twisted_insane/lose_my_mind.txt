[Twisted Insane:]
I blackout every time I overdose up off of liquor
I'm fucking up my liver but at least I got my spleen
No more drunk driving all up in the ditches on a mission
Try'na get it with the bitches on my team
I wish you bitches death and they tell me never do it
But I do it every time you hoes do get up on my nerves
Spendin' hours in the mirror on yo make up then you walkin'
Out I see you lookin' like a fuckin' ratchet bird
I'm an Android, motherfuck an iPhone
All you bitches die slow, what I gotta lie fo', nigga?
Blindfold, get up out the mic room, what the fuck you
Rhyme fo'? Bet you that my chrome's sicker
Bet you wish you would've stayed at home right now though huh?
I can tell ya bitch she wish she had a mouthful cum huhm?
Walked up in the room fee fi fo fum
Won't you stick my testicle up in ya mouth and hummmm
But I'm all up in this game and takin' shit like its a burglary
Where the fuck you livin', ho, you bitches haven't heard of me
I been doin' shit since half you niggas was in elementary
I murder all ya favourite rappers in the first degree
Fuck this maggot-ass, ragged-ass, swagger rap
Catch him at a show and get to swingin' like a battle axe (battle axe)
Run up on me rat-a-tat, (rat-a-tat)
Smoking so much think I got some cataracts
Hey batter batter-bat, I would really rather that
We put down the weapon just so I can really beat you up
If I pull a burner I 'mma heat you up
Take you out the oven, little butter then I eat you up
Take you and I bury you in grass (grass)
Maybe I 'mma leave some for my pit (pit)
Told you we would get into that ass
You could back up but you wanna represent the sick, BRAIN!

[Hook - King ISO::]
When I'm off that liquor and that hydro
I'm about to lose my mind
And make a nigga blackout I 'mma lash out
On you niggas like all the time
When I'm off that liquor and that hydro
I'm about to go so sick, flow so sick
Fuck whatever you was talkin' bout'
Because it don't mean shit (I be on it)
Because it don't mean shit (I be on it)

[Charles Xavier:]
I blackout every time I overdose up off of a hydro
You could find a nigga sleepin' somewhere in a dream
See another murder that you read about, believe I got a
Mean amount to hurt 'em, everybody on my team
Finna clean 'em out, the money and the cars and the women
For the bars and the venom, shoes on when I'm in the house
Hard when I'm in a mouth, scarred when I'm in about
Card get pulled for the bullshit you been about
You wolfin' but then I'm out stompin', conscience
Absent constant, laughin' then I count
Down to the bombs that blast, they cough
Collapse, get coffin last then I get about it
Like a nigga out-fit with skinny jeans
In the club, glow stick and a fifth of lean
This nigga thought he had a hit but he Billie Jean
See he never was shit, what I really mean?
Prolly 'cause I got a following like Halloween
Brainsick proper homi', see the monopoly
Aces should be swallow-ing when I call the queen
Then I gotta holler-ing like badabing-
Boom in a property, tomb for the corpse
Of course they know how to shoot the shit for sport
Run up and catch a body quick and do it with the fork
Check it I ain't leavin' nothing you ain't movin' to the morgue
It's straight to the walk-in
The walk-in freezer
That's the maze that you lost in
When I come up off them bleachers
Haters doin' everything to stick it to me
But I shake 'em off like seizures
I'm guessin' they ain't really get the picture fully
I'm a burn 'em all like fevers
