Life is so beautiful
But death is so wonderful

But I sit with a brain full of sick
Knowin' death comin', not runnin', this shit is tough as it gets
I could just sit back and pass, my life is just movin' too fast
And before you know it I'll be dead and gone, better follow it
They said I wouldn't make it to twenty
Said I wouldn't have bitches but bitch, I got plenty
They sayin' quit fuckin' hoes, you got too many
Kids but I'm lovin' to run in a bitch with no jimmy
Finna hit 'em when impossible, I could be the one on Mars
I feel like I do belong up in the stars
Always been livin' my life on the edge
But I promise this ain't the end, do not break out the cigars
I'm mentally scarred like I was [?]
Don't get caught up with 'he said she said'
But I keep an eye out for the police and bitch niggas
Put 'em up on a list to eradicate, I can just fuckin' decapitate
Most of you feel like you had to hate this nigga
Sick nigga, but I'm off in a different zone
I be on levels you only see up in your dreams
I can get mad at you, come back, call homies and clack at you, 
thought you was gon' make it home till we came and put two in your spleen
Know what I mean?
Death is so beautiful, life is so easy
Spend half my life full of alcohol feelin' so queasy
Pull up and fill up the Pinto with gas, I'm really not thinkin' you'll last
It's time for the livin' like George and Weezie, believe me!

Life is so beautiful
But death is so wonderful

Wonderful by the way that we die
But I'm lost with a vision, just wishin' that we multiply
But I'm knowin' my wishes will fall on deaf ears, my fear
Is nobody up in my funeral, tears fallin' out of their eye
Sunshine
But nigga, they might take you up under the moonlight
It's funny how I can sit back and make one rhyme
And all of a sudden I'm havin' a good night
You niggas is trippin', I'm 5150
But if I don't hit you with words, nigga...
Then I'mma be forced to hit you with some other shit
It's nothin' for me to sit back and get perv' with ya
Smile in your face, kill you off then you're up in a gutter ditch
I'm on a mothership, pushin' through different dimensions
Repentance my binges, malicious, so vicious I was on the daily
Makin' me take my time, fall back on shit that would
Get you hemmed up, I don't get how you go when you
Knowin' I'm sicker than rabies
And for the niggas that be thinkin' they be with it
And they really wanna be around the wicked
Don't be kiddin' when I tell 'em I'mma hit 'em
With the Voodoo...
Obvious I'm sicker than the people that you listen to
I hit it with the venom, I be givin' you
A pushin' to a limit, nigga, they ain't never been to
How do you do?
Death is so beautiful, life is so easy
Spend half my life full of alcohol feelin' so queasy
Pull up and fill up the Pinto with gas, I'm really not thinkin' you'll last
It's time for the livin' like George and Weezie, believe me!
