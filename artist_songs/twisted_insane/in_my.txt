Yea
I'm gonna do this shit like this homie
This is real, it's been long time and coming nigga
I've been trying to put this motherfuckin album out for 5,6,7,8,9 years homie
Shit, wanted this motherfucker to be a classic, a motherfucking masterpiece homie
You feel me on my shit nigga
You know what I'm saying, because on the real homie if a motherfucker don't feel me on my shit
Then they motherfuckers just hatin homie period, they motherfuckin lyin and shit or they motherfuckin hatin homie
You know what I'm talkin about, niggas can't even talk
Niggas can't youknowhatimsayin, niggas can't...

Niggas can't even talk about my gangsta cuz I'm steel
I'm still hittin switches and bustin a match of grill
Maniac in black and attackin niggas like a 6-4
Comin in on the top of the body of you and you bitch ho
I spit [?], so many bars and so many stars i see on TV
Can't even fuck with T-W-S-T
Believe me, I'm even the niggas that do it off the top
Hurts my brain, I can't believe you're rich and I am not
It must've been a plot rottin to get you dirty-poo-ass niggas
Cuz where I'm from, you'll be the last niggas
To ever get on a stage without gettin your ass beat
Not just as deep, nigga hit the streets and come to south east(south east)
Gangbangin, khaki saggin, chuck-t's
Just post up for one second watch how fast they bust these
Niggas I'm fuckin around out here, you say you have no fear
Better be true cuz niggas ain't fuckin around on here

You know what I'm sayin nigga that's real than a motherfucka
Nigga I've been doing this motherfuckin music thang nigga for so fuckin god damn long homie
So motherfuckin long nigga, you understand what I'm sayin,
and I'm still struggling like a motherfucka as I speak on this microphone right now nigga
And I'm still struggle like a motherfucka to pay my bills and eat my motherfuckin meals nigga
That's real

Niggas I'm around tellin me they always feel the drama (the drama)
Can't stand relationships and fuck my baby's mama
Just send them all to the drama and keep spittin
And fuckin these bitches one by one and keep hittin
If you's a [?], fuck you if you think I'm bullshittin
I'll take your ass to the house, throw you over the couch and stick the dick in
Infatuated with all your groupies cuz you love to go to the shows
And go straight to the mo mo's makin porno movies
Stick in, shit in and get Gucci
Piss in your mouth, shit in your mouth and then I get out
But not before I smoke up all your doobies
And stick the shit in your booty
One way trip to the factory
Smoking up so much weed that I think I got somebody after me
The fact is G, movin around the corner hittin' in my pimp [?]
[?]
And I still I do it all for the game, cuz niggas don't say no names
Yea I move but I'm still the same and man that's a [?]


In My Chuck Ts [x3]
