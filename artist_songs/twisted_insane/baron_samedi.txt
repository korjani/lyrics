They don't want to see this sort of nigga, what's ya purpose, I be on the move
I'm different, really I don't need it all, so nigga, I don't really got to prove
Nothin' I will get to bussin', I really don't wanna hear no kind of fussin'
If ya get to bluffin', I will call ya bluff and leave ya mama knowin' what it feels to lose, nigga
Slurrin' like I was just poppin' off of that bottle of Jack Danielsan
Wax on, wax off, give me that weed nigga, cigar and rum
Ya told me you wanted that turn up nigga that's hardly fun
Gettin' hella faded, now a nigga lookin' like he's so Bacardi done
Ritualism admitted, I might get a little creepy to some but
Never pass judgement, How in the world I [?] with you dumb fuck
Put a curse in you and make it worse for you so everywhere you go you lumped up
Any of you never have a friend and put ya body parts in a dump truck
Reincarnated, I'm Baron comin' in to kill 'em all
I don't ever wanna stop until I see bloodstains on the wall ("Baron")
Kill or be killed nigga, you make the call
Pull out the chainsaw and slice right through his jaw
Any time you bring a demon in it, you will always find a nigga lurkin'
The serpent, slippin' my dick up inside the beef curtains
(You certain?)
Who you think is gon' be first in line to put the work in? (-Work in)
And pullin' off and leave a motherfucka layin' hurtin' (-Hurtin)
I just really wanna know exactly what's ya purpose
[?] won't you have a nigga bring them to the grave
Come with me in the middle of the full moonlight
Say goodnight to the motherfucker because in the end they always will pay Baron Samedi

[Hook x2 - Redro Killson:]
If you wanna put a fuckin' body
In this bitch, you gotta pay me
If you wanna keep that nigga soul
I need blood, gotta pay me
Catch a nigga diggin' ditches
In the back yard like it's nothin'
Ain't sacrificed nothin'
But Brainsick niggas need somethin'
(Baron Samedi)

Introduce you to your death, you ain't gotta be afraid to take a leap
I be really doin' voodoo, won't you come in here and fuckin' take a seat?
Got a fancy for the necromancy, lookin' for the candy up under the sheet
I cut you all up into pieces so mind your business 'fore you're on my table as a feast, nigga
Die Hard like Bruce Willis but homie, I would never play with ya
Imagine me up in the cemetery with a shovel, scoopin' like a grave digger
Movin' like I'm an assassin, I'm a professor like I was Xavier
Savior, and I ain't ever gotta ask a bitch if it's okay with her
Dancin' around that fire, lookin' like I am wild, but it's really Voodoo
I can only imagine what people think about a nigga like I'm really cuckoo
(Cuckoo?) Yeah, nigga, Shaka Zulu!
Niggas be wolfin' all up on the internet, in person they run away and drop doo-doos
I'm Baron, nigga, why you starin' at me, with a cane and black hat
I be really into black magic, don't need no black cat
I be try'na tell that mothafucka for years so don't be lookin' at a nigga surprised when you hear that brrat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Put a curse up on you, somethin' simple, I don't know, like a nose bleed
Could be unbearable, the pain that you feel in your brain and your dome piece
When they pull up on you, hop out with the badge and say "Freeze"
NWA nigga, still Fuck tha Police!
Straight from South East, they gon'
Run and get bang out, green strains, got [?]
Nothin' for me to put the price on your neck
The most evil of all Loa when I strike like a boa
And I promise you and your family that I will bring you all death
Baron Samedi!
