That's it
Turn the page on the day, walk away 
'cos there's sense in what I say 
I'm 45th generation Roman 
But I don't know 'em 
Or care when I'm spitting 
So return to your sitting position and listen it's fitting 
I'm miles ahead and they chase me 
Show yer face on TV, then we'll see 
You can't do half, my crew laughs 
At yer rhubarb and custard verses 
You rain down curses but I'm waving, 
Yer hearse is driving by 
Streets riding high, with the beats in the sky 
All stare, eyes glazed 
Garage burnt down, the fire raged 
For 40 days and in 40 ways 
But through the blaze they see it fade 
The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces 
Then a figure emerges from the wastage 
Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze 
One hand clutching a sword raised to the sky 
They wonder how, they wonder why 
The sky turns white, it all becomes clear 
They felt lifted from their fears 
They shed tears in the light 
After 6 dark years 
Young bold soldiers, the fire burns 
Cracks and smoulders 
5 years older and wiser 
The fires are burning on fire, never tire 
Slay warriors in the forests and on higher 
We sing, hear the strings rising 
The war's over, the bells ring 
Memories fading, soldiers slaying 
Looks like geezers raving 
The hazy fog over the Bull Ring
The lazy ways the birds sing 
A new baby's born every day 
Few men may be scorned today 
But look at things the other way 
Cos it may well be yer final day 
And then the crowds roar, they slay, they all say 
I produce this using only my bare wit 
Gimme a jungle, a garage beat and admit defeat, 
Use war and past injury as my metaphor and simile 
Get all applications into me before the deadline 
Cos it's a fine line between strifeful crimes 
And a life of crime 
But you will reach the day, and it's all mine 
You can take it or leave it,
I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix 
In the afterlife gladiators meet their maker 
Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water 
To the next life from the fortress 
Away from the knives and slaughter 
To their wives and daughters 
Once more before the Lord judges over all of us
Cos in this place you'll see me 
Brace yourself, cos this goes deep
I'll show you the secrets, the sky and the birds 
Actions speak louder than words 
Stand by me my apprentice 
Be brave, clench fists.
