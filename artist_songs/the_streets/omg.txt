Looked at your status,
"In a relationship",
"In a relationship",
An earthquake hit me (Oi!)

Your status had changed,
You've never worked about this.
Couldn't drag my eye away,
The words on the screen
Nothing set between us but you just weren't that keen,
In a relationship,
Plain Helvetica.

Got to walk away and... let it go.
Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow a revelation, (Oh oh)
Then I get you, you get me honestly and,
Wow a situation.
Oh my gosh why did you leave it so late to tell me,
Wow a revelation.
Then I get you and you get me on the street and,
Wow a relation.

Looked at your photo, of folks I didn't know,
Folks I hadn't noticed seem close to you now,
We'd been hangin' out a lot,
I'd gathered that would have to stop.

All that build up for me,
All the weeks of us walking past tree after tree,
All the patience and doubt,
The relational maybe..
May as well bow you're in a relationship now.

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow a revelation. (Oh oh)
Then I get you and you get me honestly ,
and, wow a situation.

Oh my gosh why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow a revelation. (Uh oh)
Then I look at you and you look at me on the street and,
Wow a situation.

Looked at your status,
"In a relationship"
"In a relationship"
It devastated me.
Then what did I spy, I punched the fucking sky 
Among the normally ignorable requests at the right,
I'd of never of guessed a request so nice,
Now if you look at my status,
I'm in a relationship too... with you.

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow, a revelation. (Oh oh)
Then I look at you and you look at me honestly and,
Wow a situation.

I stand corrected I was pushing for the best I guess I took one look at you and I could fog out the rest if I've got what it takes, and it won't be wasted on fakes.

I paced myself,
I have faith this time,
I saw something for me,
I felt something right.

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow a revelation.
Then I look at you and you look at me honestly and,
wow a situation.

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow a revelation.
Then I look at you and you look at me honestly and,
wow a situation.
