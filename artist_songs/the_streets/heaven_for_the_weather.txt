I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

There's something in the sun this day, I feel it 
Or maybe it's just my hay fever 
The weeds are green, the sky is shining 
But it'll soon be night which is nicer 
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room 
And the devil gestures to you 
You've never seen such a Beelzebee 
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening 
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out 
What do you make of this doubt? 
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up 
Easy - I know what my speech should be 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

The devil beams a big beaming grin 
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin 
He holds up paperwork - sign the line 
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine 
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet 
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreat 
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin 
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin 
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars 
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating - 
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

You tell the devil in no uncertain terms 
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned 
What is this evil? And who decides this? 
When left to devices some humans try shit 
This is the reason we should all be tied up? 
We're just normal people exploring our minds 
We don't go around here putting poison in wine 
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right 
People are intricate, people aren't swines 
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds 
Sign on the line 
You sign on the line 
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me 

I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell for the company 
I want to go to heaven for the weather 
But hell seems like fun to me
