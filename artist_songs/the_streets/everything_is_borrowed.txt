This is my hour, I'm never going to bed. 
The sky is still black, but begs to be red. 
I just put my book down, but it begs to be read 
I'm not nod, I'm not napper, never rest my head. 
Some days I feel I'm getting smaller and smaller, 
But some nights, I seem to grow taller and taller. 
And we keep shrinkin' and shrinkin' but this will not finish. 
You're never nothing, if you didn't disappear. 
Just when I discovered the meaning of life, they change it. 
Just when I'm loving life, it seems to start raining. 
I pulled the sail safe switch, sea sail and I'm into the stars. 
I love the rain out my skies. The sky's now red, my eyes reflect jets. 
Smiling at this blessing, this life is the best. 

I came to this world with nothing 
And I leave with nothing but love 
Everything else is just borrowed 

I want to notice chances I've passed without notice 
I want to see details previously veiled. 
I want to grab that chance, carry it home 
So I can marry and know 
That I noticed every chance 
That I could have passed without notice 
I saw details that to all were veiled. 
And I grabbed those chances, carried them home 
And then I'll have had it with roaming 

I came to this world with nothing 
And I leave with nothing but love 
Everything else is just borrowed 

I want to speak every cliche but tweak if i've seen change 
In new way it could be said. 

If it's bleak, or if the week's leaking down the street 
Or if any days wasted I want to face facts. 
My time on this earth is my only penny, 
Wise is the gent counting every moment spent. 
I don't want to explain things, don't wanna fill in the gaps, 
I want to look at my friends and in that minute be at : 

Memories are times we borrow 
For spending tomorrow. 
Memories are times we borrow 
For spending tomorrow. 

I came to this world with nothing 
And I leave with nothing but love 
Everything else is just borrowed 

If spit like luck, you can only seem, 
To borrow it, you can't keep it. 
When the wind of change whistles into play 
Will I blink or flinch away? 
The wind of change won't whistle me away 
If I spin my tails and sail. 
And sail away, let yesterday become today. 

I came to this world with nothing 
And i leave with nothing but love 
Everything else is just borrowed 

As time will say, nothing but 
I told you so 

Memories are times we borrow 
For spending tomorrow.
