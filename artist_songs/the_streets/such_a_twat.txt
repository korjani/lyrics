Yeah safe man, you ok? 
Just calling to ensure you got back in 
Hope you coped yesterday, cos I felt well damn grim 
But yeah in the air on the plane my stomach was turning 
Man I was hanging 
head-to-sted on the headrest in pain 
Prayed away all my bad sins 
Lost count of the plain chardonnays before the fourth or maybe the fifth 
In future I need to abstain 
If only id had a bit of discipline 
But worth every bit of spare change 
Pure clowning down to the last drink 

(Hang on let me slam the door mate; just pause that thought for a bit) 

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
Coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
But I could've ruined it, I’m such a twat 

I’ve been pacing the place well paralysed since I got back in with my bags though 
Yeah I’m too aware that last night was way mad slack 
I know 
Carried in a gang I lost sight of Simone 
On her own back at home 
Distracted from the fact it weren’t right 
could have raised up the hand but no 
Simone was moaning and that about me playing away on this holiday 
She was watching the box at her dad’s house 
there, preparing spliffs away 
As I’m smacking glasses down at George Bests best session rate 

(Can you hear me? Na sorry mate your fuzzy mate I can’t hear ya) 

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
Coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
But I could've ruined it, I’m such a twat 

(I lost you for a minute yeah yeah I can hear you now) 

See I mean that the true thing though I suppose I chose myself to allow 
I was weak and stupid but as far as I viewed anyhow 
She couldn’t have been it for me, the only girl id ever go out with 

I didn’t want to waste my youth in a girl’s house to the sound of spliffs 
And when she got in a mood with me in that text about that thing 
I just switched off the phone when she started shouting 
Coming to a conclusion I couldn’t be bothered with anymore rowing 

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
Coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
But I could've ruined it, I’m such a twat 

(Nah nah nah) 

And then after shots made me lose the plot 
It all got a bit bizarre 
And that incident with the ice cream I forgot, it all ended in our vodka 
What I can remembers a blotch 
I got a fat bruise on my arm 
She weren’t even much too hot but she totally mugged me up like rah 
She knew exactly what she was doing and it all went a bit too far 
She was with that bloke in the white top in McDonalds car park 
And then she let me chat her up later on in that lovely little bar 

(Hello? Ahh fucking phones man) 

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
Coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
But I could've ruined it, I’m such a twat 

(Yeah I think we got cut off, yeah I got crap reception in my house.
I have to stand in a certain spot in my kitchen or it cuts out) 

Yeah you know I was potty to even let myself allow it 
I would if I could just swap what happened then for right now 
And if she ever found out how far it got it would be more than just a row 
This whole thing just got on top but its her that I want, no doubt 
So in a way its helped me doing wrong 
I know I’ve fucked up now 
This is where that dodgy shit stops 
She’s just gotta not find out 

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
Coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
But I could've ruined it, I’m such a twat
