[Intro:]
Ooohhh...
Shoooo...
Do, do, do, do, do, dooo...

[Verse 1:]
I'm a superman thanks to Lois Lane
Kissed away my problems when I went insane
Took me from the depths when I lost my name (oooh)
Give me something I could live for
Now everyone is wondering what's the change
They don't recognize I have so much to say
And I never thought someone could love someone
So much that they give up on everything
Jah knoooow...

[Chorus:]
I will be there when you need me
I will be there when you cry baby
I will be there when you need someone to tell you
That you're beautiful baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover till the sky turn gray girl
Cause you're beautiful baby

Yes, you're beautiful
Oh you're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful baby
Yes, you're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful baby

[Verse 2:]
Feel butterflies when I'm in your hands
You can turn the pavement into white sand
You can make a moment, a memory in a glance
And I can't believe anyone else
And everybody's talking
You're always shining
You never stop glistening baby
And I never thought someone could love someone
So much that they give up on everything
Jah knoooow...

[Chorus:]
I will be there when you need me
I will be there when you cry baby
I will be there when you need someone to tell you
That you're beautiful baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover till the sky turn gray girl
Cause you're beautiful baby

Till it's beautiful
Oh you're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful baby
Yes, you're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful
You're beautiful baby

(Beautiful)
Beautiful...
(Beautiful)
Beautiful... ooh

[Verse 3:]
There's a million people underneath the sun
That can find a million more but never find the one
There's a girl who did this and a socialite
Was on magazines, was the shy type
I'm a superman thanks to Lois Lane
Kissed away my problems when I went insane
And I never thought someone could love someone
So much that they give up on everything
Ooh-aah...

[Chorus:]
I will be there when you need me
I will be there when you cry baby
I will be there when you need someone to tell you
That you're beautiful baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover till the sky turn yeah man
Cause you're beautiful baby

Till it's beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful
You're beautiful baby
Yes, you're beautiful
Oh You're beautiful
Yes, you're beautiful baby

[Outro:]
I will be there when you need me
I will be there when you cry baby
I will be there when you need someone to tell you
That you're beautiful baby
Baby...
