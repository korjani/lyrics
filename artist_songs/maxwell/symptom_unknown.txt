There's an ocean, drained of all it's fish
took a bath, I just can't get clean
wonder when you'll show 
if not everything is inbetween
you and I were supposed to grow old
guess it was a symptom unknown

It was a power that knows just how you feel
we were prone to feel a love not real, oh yeah
wonder when you'll show
if not I'm gonna feel what I feel
you and I were supposed to grow old
was your symptom unknown

Baby some things are told
you and I were supposed to grow old
guess it was a symptom unknown
guess it was the things that you wore
guess it was the way it was cold
I guess it was yeah

There's a child that used to smile
there's a man that used to feel his heart??
oh why 
what am I supposed to do without you close
who am I supposed to try to toast
no, what am I supposed to do
ooh 
if you don't show
if, if you don't show
