It's you, it's you (ooooh,mmhmmm) 

[Verse 1:]
You come out from nowhere, disappear and reappear 
Houdini would be very proud 
I can speculate your fears, wonder on your tears 
But I just wanna hear your sound 
And I know you love to live extremes 
Your sword is made above your dreams, but tell me who's cut now 
There's a road that's paved and made 
With signs along the way, come through somehow (whooa, oh) 

[Chorus:]
I can be anything you want me to be 
I just wanna love you 
Show you exactly what you mean to me 
Honey let me love you 

[Verse 2:]
Listen to the way I feel 
When love can change you, love arranges you 
Heaven blessed the day God sent you here 
Hoping that love don't disappear 
Feel you in ways I can't understand 
Honey, baby, tell me I can be yo' man 

[Chorus:]
Let me be anything you want me to be 
Baby let me love you 
Show you exactly what you mean to me 
Honey let me love you 
Love you now, love you now (oooh, MmHmm) 

[Bridge:]
And even after years, I need you when you don't 
I remain more stubborn then I ever was before 
I bear the witness, bear the witness for you girl 
All that is good is 'cause of you off in the world 
I'll never go, I'm frozen, I'm standing here 
Won't move until the day I get you near 
Hear me when I say, you're the one I want 
If you take this rib don't let it go (oooh,oh,oh,oh,oh) 

Baby don't leave or ever go (no)
