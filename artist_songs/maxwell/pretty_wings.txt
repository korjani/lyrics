[Verse 1:]
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

[Hook:]
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to live, I had to live
I had to leave, I had to leave

[Chorus:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

[Verse 2:]
I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights better times better days
I miss you more and more

[Chorus:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
So pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
So pretty wings, oh, pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around

[Repeat until end:]
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around
