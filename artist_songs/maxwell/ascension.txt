Oooooh... 

It happened the moment, when you were revealed 
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been 
A fantasy real 
You gave me this beating baby 
This rhythm inside 
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved 
Give me paradise 

[1] - So shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it 
So don't ever wonder 
[repeat 1]

So tell me how long 
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe 
'Cause I can't live my life 
Without you here by my side 
Ooh... 
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life
