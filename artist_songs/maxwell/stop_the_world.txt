Someone stop the world, yeah
Seems like the moment has come and I'm gonna get you girl
The shadows are forming across your parts
The vision looks absurd, yeah
No one around to interrupt the feelings you stir baby

Imagine if it was, if this was you, if this was I
So perfectly designed to be here all night
Let the world rage outside
'Cause when I'm here with you the world stops for me
The world stops for me

And then extraordinary, ordinary things
Things I can't explain with subtext, the world stops for me
And girl you know just what I mean, I, I need you girl
Sing me a song, sing it soft, sing it long, girl stop my world, oh

Imagine if it was, if this was you, if this was I
So perfectly designed to be here all night
Let the world rage outside
'Cause when I'm here with you the world stops for me
The world stops for me

Someone stop the world, stop it, stop it, stop, ooh
Someone, someone stop the world, stop the world

We about to stop the world tonight
We're about to love, we ain't got no worries, no battles
I'm gonna be with my girl tonight
We about to stop the world, stop the world, stop the world
(We about to stop the world tonight)
We're about to love, we ain't got no worries, no battles

You are my own, yeah
(We about to stop the world tonight)
Make yourself at home
(I'm gonna be with my girl tonight)
And lay here all night long, yeah
(We about to stop the world tonight)
Oh yeah
