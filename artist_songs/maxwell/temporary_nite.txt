Earthquake in the makin
I'm gonna love you 
when you persist with all that shakin' 
what you expect me to do 
it's more than just the bacon
it's sumthin about yo' insides too 
you know I been waitin' 
waitin on the wall for you 
so if ever you should question

If I'll spend the nite with you 
you and me what we gonna do
a temporary nite for two
don't change a lonely afternoon

I been misbehavin' 
I been thinkin nasty thoughts about you
I'm sorry baby
I enter said I was an angel 
who could be w. a fine as fine as you 
move that body go ahead adn cast that corporal spell
adn if they ask me baby I promise not to tell...

If I'll spend the nite with you 
you and me what we gonna do
a temporary nite for two
don't change a lonely afternoon

Its your style, your soul adn 
those personalities 
temporary nite
It's not the typical, no bull baby 
want you as a wife 
want you all my life yeah
if ever you should question....

If I'll spend the nite with you 
you and me what we gonna do
a temporary nite for two
don't change a lonely afternoon
