It's been so long since I have got you lady 
Since I have had yo brown legs wrapped around me 
The smell of she just drives me crazy 
Imagine what the sight of her can do 

[1] - Suitelady don't worry 
Ain't no end to what this ring wants to begin with you 
I've waited suitelady 
Cause no man can tear asunder 
What my can groove 

I never thought myself the kinda guy 
The kinda man that would ever want to settle down 
Statistics say it's crazy, passion won't survive 
But something says nawh deep down deep down inside 

[Repeat 1]

Groove love can groove me and you awwhh 
Suitelady 

I don't mean to be dramatic baby 
I only wanna understand you baby 
So will you marry me?
