Took a high from a low 
Took my icy freeze and thawed the cold 
An inspired undisclosed 
It's a privacy that y'all should know 
Never wonder cause I know 
Ain't no other got this flow 
Lady lover, lady soul 
You're my discovered pot of gold 

[1] - I found a cure for this 
Cococure for this 
It's got me plushed on some luxurious 
Cococure 

It's a happy in a sad 
It's a more that's less 
It's a glad, drive me crazy (ooh baby) 
You're my mommy, you're my dad 
Lady lover never go 
You're the part of my heart that is soul 

[Repeat 1]
