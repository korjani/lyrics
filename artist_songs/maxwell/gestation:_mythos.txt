She became filled earlier 
As the late of destiny carved her creation 
To the unsuspecting few 
Holding in and hiding the pregnancy 
She continued the dance, she moved 
A year before now the dance would draw to an end 
And the cleansing would need to begin 
This next breed would be the bridge into the millenium 
I was brought in then 
I was then blessed to aid the midwives 
Thirty nine weeks crawled 
And it seemed as if this walk would never run 
Until she pulled a plushe filled push 
And out from her came them 

Each a radiant distinctive 
Familiar as I have never seen in gazes before 
They were filled blessed like thrills 
I wondered their names as she thought 
To me a thought in confidence 
That she would make the news known soon 
Dispelling shame 
She assured me of no crime 
As I was lost in the beholding 
When the world looked upon 
The coven they wondered the father 
They suspected the mother, they insulted 
For some connection 
When in fact they were the bond 
It took a moment as they would find individual lovers 
Out of each of the babies 

I looked on, hoping they would understand the growth 
Not quite sure if I'd ever begin to myself 
I would soon learn that ones here before me 
Would usher in the next trinity of beings 
I would soon learn that this 
Was the scratch on the surface yet to be formed 
Was I prepared? This would begin the domino effect 
Of a million questions unanswered
