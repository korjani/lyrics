[1] - Lay all night, here on top 
If you want to 
I'm giving you all I've got, every drop 
Don't you want to 

Minus my negative 
Change what I thought I'd never 
Spoke a kiss, verbal bliss 
And I was made a much mo' better 

Cause where you touched was such a no-no 
A blushe filled plushe 
I loved it oh so, 
I love it oh so much 
It's suiter than candy 
Could all this lust be a symptom of you 

Lay all night here on top if you want to 
I'm giving you every drop 
Don't you want to 
Everwanting to want you to want 

Burn the cold, take the snow 
Make July out of December 
Light the night in afterlife 
And make this soul a much mo' better 
Cause where you touched 
How could you know 
A blushe filled plushe 
I love it oh so much, 
Could all this lust be a symptom of you 

[Repeat 1]

Everwanting to want you to want
