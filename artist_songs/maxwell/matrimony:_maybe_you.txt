[1] - Maybe you might be more than 
Just a one night lady 
Maybe you might be matrimony 
Trying to save me 

Maybe you may be the lady, lady love 
I'm prayin, dreamin, livin and thinking of 

[Repeat 1]

Teach me 'bout me 
Tell me what you thought 
I thought, you thought, I thought 
Use me, drain me 
Of all the things you want 
You know girl can't be bought 

[Repeat 1]

Maybe you might be 
Sweet matrimony 
A one-derful in-two a family 

[Repeat 1]
