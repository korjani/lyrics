[1] - If it's cool we can do a little sumthin' sumthin' 
Let me grove with you so we can kick a little 
sumthin' sumthin' 

Even though she pays me no attention 
All I wanna show is my affection 
Lose myself inside her ebony 
But she ain't even checkin' me so 

[Repeat 1]

Honeydosugachocolate dumplin' yeah 
Sista with a certain sumthin' sumthin' 
Flava with a cocoa kinda flow 
Baby, baby act like you know 

[2] - So if it's cool I wanna rock with you 
Slip you my mellow smooth 
Rock you until we blue 
Only only if it's cool 

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1 until fade]
