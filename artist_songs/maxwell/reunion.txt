So long I've searched for you 
So long but now it's true 

Girl it's our reunion. reunion 
It's our reunion, reunion 

I'm always here I'm in yo ear, yeah 
Love stereo so don't you fear, don't fear 

Cause it's our reunion. reunion 

Since last we loved 
No-one's come near 
No girl can ever compare 
To you my dear 
Girl it's our reunion. 
Reunion. Reunion, Reunion 

It's our reunion 
We're back together
