(Yeah, look at you)
Look at you
You look fine
How do you do
Been a while since alone in your room (room)
Been around, but haven't found
No one like you (no one like you)
Don't you know girl
There's no one like you

And you hear me
Hear my emotions creep slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Now with your soul tell me
Silently

Tell me (you) know each thought without a word
You see me through (you see me through)
Sorry now (sorry now) that I ever doubted you
I don't know what I can do
To make you come true
Think that you should know
There's no one like you and how you are

Your mind and heart
Nine times the soul (ooh)
Nine times the soul
There's no one like you

Can you hear me (hear me baby)
(emotions) Scream slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Now with your soul tell me
Silently

Tell me
Silently

Ahh baby

(me)

Love the way you (ho)
With your mind lady (ho)
My body soul (ho)
If you aint told
You got to know
I'm willin' to show you if you want to know

(know me)
Hear my emotions scream slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Hear intertwine scremin'
Silently

Screamin' silently
(don't you scream)
You're my divine
(don't you scream)
Slowly
(touch you, hear what you want baby)
Don't speak
Say with your heart (say it to me)
Silently

Tell me
Silently
(woo-woo-woo-wooo)
Silently

(me)
