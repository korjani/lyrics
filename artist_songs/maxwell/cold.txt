I'm being cruel, baby
I had to go and think that I could be more best
Left alone then with you next, it develops none the less
Hell hath no fury than the flurry of your snow

Global warming ain't got nothing on this chic
She's not to play with, you can't just leave this
You can't just think that you can quit this
She'll make you regret this

She's on top and she means business
As God is my witness my summer's gone frigid
My summer's gone frigid
I know you can hear this

How can you be so cold? How can you be so cold?
Good God the girl's gone cold, oh my the girl's gone cold
How can you be so cold? How can you be so cold?
I'm gon' freeze fo' sho', oh Lord you're so cold, so cold, so cold

Tell me baby why I can't believe, yeah
Something as good as you could ever love me, oh
Lighter than air, you felt like a ton of bricks
You dropped out from the sky filled with mercy

How can you be so cold? How can you be so cold?
Good God the girl's gone cold, oh my the girl's gone cold

God bless you baby, oh you're too good to me
Too good to be anything the mortal man can call on
Do it baby, do it baby

How can you be so cold? How can you be so cold?
Good God the girl's gone cold, oh my the girl's gone cold
How can you be so cold? How can you be so cold?
I'm gon' freeze fo' sho', oh Lord you're so cold, so cold, so cold
Oh Lord you're so cold, so cold, so cold
