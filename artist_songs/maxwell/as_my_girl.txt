Hey babe, it's been a long while 
Baby, baby, been a mighty long time 
I watched you, even though you would not see baby 
(Check it) 
Glad to see that you're still so fine and 
I remember you back when 
Girl you blew my mind 
And I saw you, even though you would not see 
Lady, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, baby 

[1] - Be as you are 
Girl it's okay with me 
You're such a star 
Maybe one day you'll see 
That whatever you are 
I'm just hoping you'll be, as my girl, girl 

Oh I need to be back 
Back by your side 
Sugar back way back when 
Kissing was a crime 
I miss you and I know you miss me 
Baby, oh 
Baby, baby, baby 

[Repeat 1]

Babygirl, showing off cars with the laughter 
You're my world (my world) 
Paradise from deception 
How about you and me ever after as my girl? 

[Repeat 1 till end]
