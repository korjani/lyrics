Confusing as this is 
I hope my kiss can rectify 
The lack of part time bliss 
A weightlessness inside 
Your life, Your life, your life 

[1] - Oohh waah let's drown deep in us 
Oohh waah make no fight, no fuss 
Oohh waah come drown deep in us 
In us, in us, in us, in us 

I'll wear your liquid kiss 
And watch as if inside 
Dispel the negative 
As if a myth alive 
Why should I let you go 
How could I let you go 
When we be up here all alone 
Hula hula baby 

[Repeat 1]
