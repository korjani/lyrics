[1] - Let me groove with you momma 
Cause I can't take it any longer 
C'mon n' dance with me baby dance with me 

I got my eye on you 
I watch the way you groove 
You look so very cool 
The way your body moves 

I like the way you shake your body all around 
So damn glad you came but I just wanna get down 
So 

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

But don't you know 
That I like the way you shake yo' body all around? 
I don't wanna play no games I just wanna get down
