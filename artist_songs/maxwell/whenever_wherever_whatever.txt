Lead me on girl if you must 
Take my heart and my love 
Take of me all that you want 
And if there's a thing that you need 
I'd give you the breath that I breathe 
N' if ever you yearn for the love in me 
Whenever Wherever Whatever 

Wish I knew if I could 
Be the one that you would 
Love forever n' a day baby 
And if there's a thing that you need 
For you n' your blood I would bleed 
N' if ever you yearn for the love in me 
Whenever Wherever Whatever 

And if there's a thing that you need 
I'd give you the breathe 
N' if ever you yearn for the love in me 
Whenever Wherever Whatever
