We won’t let our spirit break
LONG AS SHE’S STANDING
Even though our nerves are frayed
WE WON’T GIVE UP THE GHOST
Keep on through thick and thin
LONG AS SHE’S STANDING
We have something on which to cling
WE WON’T GIVE UP THE GHOST

We were born to suffer for posterity
Not for god or country - FOR FAMILY
We did what we had to, so remember
We went down a path that no one chose

We’ll keep trying to believe
LONG AS SHE’S STANDING
That there’s good in humanity
WE WON’T GIVE UP THE GHOST
We’ll continue to look for strength
LONG AS SHE’S STANDING
Even if we have none left
WE WON’T GIVE UP THE GHOST

Digging out, not knowing what’s next
Digging in, put to the test
Standing strong, our beacon prevails
In the face of all this iron rain

Born into this chaos, NO REASON OR RHYME
Born into this downward spiral, WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME
Born into this hellhole, NO REASON OR RHYME
Irreplaceable lives cut short, WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME
