Invest time, invest life 
Invest it all, reinvent yourself
Before you know it 
Your essence is renewed with something fresh 
Your will, your way
Will earn respect in your day
Let the glory sharpened knife 
Carve the future of your life

Let's not praise the past, just a fact
Built to last
Old school or the new 
Doesn't mean a thing if your heart's not true
Greedy ones faded fast, we're here 
Built to last 
For the fun, not a fad 
The love and the truth so powerful

Work out the snags of the past 
Work out the snags that won't last 
Mistakes have finished my brothers 
Mistakes will guide all the others 
Your will, your way
Might shape a better day 
Eradicate the stagnancy 
Eradicate it like disease

Let's not praise the past, just a fact
Built to last
Old school or the new 
Doesn't mean a thing if your heart's not true
Greedy ones faded fast, we're here 
Built to last 
For the fun, not a fad 
The love and the truth so powerful
The love and the truth so powerful

As we've seen around the world
We won't go away
'Cause we'll always feel this way 
We're here to stay 
And our impact will be felt
We won't go away 
If we feel it, we feel it
We're here to stay
Built to last
