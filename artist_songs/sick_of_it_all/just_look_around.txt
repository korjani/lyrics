The question they keep asking me 
How can one so young be so bitter and angry 
Well, the answer is plain to see 
Maybe if they weren't so blind they'd see what I see
I see the homeless livin' out on the street 
On every corner they're asking for money 
I try to help them whenever I can 
But sometimes I can't afford to help myself 
I see diseases and modern plagues of our times 
The greed of our leaders has made them blind 
To our problems 
They spend millions overseas,
People right here are fightin' wars everyday

I see the whites that hate the blacks 
Blacks against the jews, race against religion
And there all too blind to see 

When we fight each other it puts all of them at ease 
It keeps us so busy, so they can do what they please 
Election time comes and they're out for votes 
That's when you see and hear from them the most 
This is what they're calling a democracy 
That's just another word for hypocrisy 
We keep fallin' for the bait 
When we realize, it's always too late

I see the whites that hate the blacks 
Blacks that hate the jews, brother against brother
And they're all to blind to see 

As the rich get richer, the poor goin' hungry 
I've seen the toll it takes on the workingman's family
Education system that's obsolete 
Can't hold a kid's interest or keep 'em off the street 
See a father's fear, hear a mother's cry 
What kind of a nation lets their children die 
Government's corrupt and full of red tape 
Then you're gonna ask me why I hate 

Why don't you open up your eyes so you can see 
Open up your ears so you can hear 
Take a look around and you will find 
Take a look around and you will find out why
