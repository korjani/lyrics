Cities of money, dried up, no longer running 
palace corroded, condemned like all the 
people that were captive in the trouble that 
doubled the self destructive jungle 
never had the chance to rise above and 
see what's on the other side 
what's the use to put trust in another man 
what's the use to put trust in another's hand 
when the trust has been erased 
and the gate just slams right in your fuckin' face

Life's games - hard to play 
what's given, is often just taken away 
burned out of the game 
we let all our evil just guide the way
Misdirected energy intimidates authority as planned
Working for solutions 
and whoever's not part of it 
is part of the problem 

Fat cats and police 
the wolves tear at the sheep
colors are shown 
loyalty blown 
the wolves tear at their brothers and sisters
and slaughter upon slaughter will act as fertilizer 
it feeds the weeds 
a symbol of resilience to tyranny

Working for solutions
