Don't think of the could've beens 
Don't think of what should've been
Weed out your weaknesses 
piled up issue makes a mess 
Don't think you had a chance 
don't dwell on lost romance 
Nothing is guaranteed 
or caters to stupidity 

They say life is what you make it 
can't go back and try to change it 
learn to live with your regrets 

Choose a path choose it right 
it's all there in black and white 
disassociate joy and wealth 
just don't even kid yourself 

They say life is what you make it 
can't go back and try to change it 
choices that were made 
opportunities 
push away the pain and move on 
with no delay 
move on accept the shame 
learn to live with your regrets 
move on with no delay 
move on accept the shame
it's all behind you anyway
