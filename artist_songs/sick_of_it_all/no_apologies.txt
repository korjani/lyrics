Respect is earned through dedication
Work in progress never stops.
Insult me with your hatred
And I say what have you got
Nothing, Nothing where it counts.
It's a weak mans notion that I owe you.
Open doors not enough
Now you want to be carried through.
No regrets!

Don't blame me for your failures
I've had more than I can count
In reality its not about me
Just take a look inside yourself
Nothing, Nothing, Nothings sacred.
Don't tell me that I owe you.
Open palms and empty lies
Are what we've seen from you!
No regrets! 

We'll Never ever lay down
No apologies
Don't wanna hear the lies
No apologies.

We've got a right to be
Cant let em take you out
We're not about to give up our convictions.
No apologies.
The powers in your hands
No doubt.
