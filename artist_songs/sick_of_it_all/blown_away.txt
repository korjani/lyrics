Down is where they want to see you
Down is where they want to keep you
Down, somber and silent
Faith is used against you
Faith is a line that they feed you
Faith is only a word
Don't believe their empty lies
Fear is how they grip you
Fear is fixed inside you
Fear of unacceptance
Same old story will we ever learn
Fall for the cliches all over again
With a calculating coldness it never ends
Their indifference just blows me away
Down is where they want to see you
Down is where they want to keep you
Down, somber and silent
Faith is used against you
Faith is a line that they feed you
Faith is only a word
You can only save yourself
Fear is how they grip you
Fear is fixed inside you
Fear of unacceptance
I can tell you what's at stake
'Till I'm blue in the face
Your blind acceptance blows me away
What is it that we haven't said or haven't done
Or are you turning a deaf ear to these words
You sit unknowing with your pathetic apathy
You may have grown to accept this, but not me
You shut your eyes to the truth
But I've seen the evil that men do
The answer staring you right in the face
Another generation fooled
It blows me away
Blows me away
Blows me away
Blows me away
Blows me away
Blown Away
