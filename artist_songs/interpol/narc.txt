Touch your thighs, I'm the lonely one
Remember that last sweat, because that was the right one
Oh, all your mysteries are moving in the sun
I show some love and respect
Wanna get some love and respect
Baby you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight
Cause it's just you, me and this wire, alright
Let's tend to the engine tonight

Oh

She found a lonely salve
She keeps on waiting for time out there
Oh love, can you love me babe?
Love, is this loving babe?
Is time turning around?

Feast your eyes, I'm the only one
Control me, console me
'Cause that's just how it should be done.
Oh, all your history's like fire from a busted gun
I show some love and respect
I don't wanna get a life of regret

But baby you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight

She found a lonely salve
She keeps on waiting for time out there
Oh love, can you love me babe?
Love, is this loving babe?
Is time turning around?

We slips into the bedroom
Babe, you know me, this is alright.
Holding we'll make soon
Will sustain us through the night
Inside my bedroom baby
Touch me, oh tonight
Poses, we'll make some
Will reveal our sense of right

You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You could be in my space
