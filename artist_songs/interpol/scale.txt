I have a sequin for an eye
Pick a rose and hide my face
This is a bandit's life
It comes and goes and them's the breaks
Under a molten sky, beyond the road, we lie in wait
You think they know us now?
Wait 'til the stars come out
You'll see that
Well, I made you and now I take you back
It's too late but today I can define the lack
I made you and now I take you back
Sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
I can still feel it when you lie
Pick a rose just to hide my face
Well, if there's something I should know
I seek no science when there is no shape
Under a molten sky, let the days collide
Well, I made you and now I take you back
Sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
