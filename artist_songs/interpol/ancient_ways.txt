Ooh, fuck the ancient ways
They are heretofore
Shown no claim

Got the time, won't seek
They are oh still coming to paint the street
(At the station)

The city feeds us all like babes
And we've taken a bow
(At the station)

Shape the fight through sound
Become dutifully bound
To the ground

Fuck the ancient ways
They are ringing doorbells
They ran it by waste
(At the station)

The city needs us and all our names
Enterprise in her eyes
(At the station)

But beneath us an empire grows
Every stage we align
(At the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are to be beaten by the weight
(At the station)

Come be people and enjoy our glow
Every change we allow
(At the station)

The city sees us all like babes
And we've taken a vow
(At the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are beaten by the weight
(At the station)

Should we seek them for the sake of it?
May we greet them right away
