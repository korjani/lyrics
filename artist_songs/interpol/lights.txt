All that I see
Show me your ways
Teach me to meet my desires...
With some grace

All that I fear
Don't turn away
And leave me to plead in this hole of a place...
Cause what if I never break
Estuary won't you take me
Far away
Far away

All that I seek
Please police me
I want you to police me
But keep it clean
Uhhh...

How have you been, my day
Now let's take them away
(That's why I hold you)
Strong as you've seen
Old as you behave
(That's why I hold you)
You will always obey
(That's why I hold you)

All that I feel
Capital ways
Teach me to grieve and conspire
With my age

All that I can see
Domestic spree
A seething routine
I could never navigate
Maybe I like to stray

No heart unseen will be left so clean
Not today
It's like you want it that way

All that I see
Is peaceful eyes drawn away from me
Drawn away from me
(Drawn away from me)

We would like to take the sights
(That's why I hold you)
And bring silence in disguise
(That's why I hold you, dear)
We would like to meet the buyer
(That's why I hold you)
That is all your life

That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you dear....
