Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
Vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
The soul can wait
It's still pretty
What with all these leaves
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
But if it's still pretty
What with all these leaves
We'll be fine, oh
And supervise
Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
And you vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today
I know you try
You fly straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
Girl, I know you try
You fly straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
But here comes the fall
So much for make-believe, I'm not sold
So much of dreams, deceit, I'm not prepared to know
Your heart makes me feel
Your heart makes me bold
For always and ever
I'll never let go
Always concealed
Safe and inside, alive
Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
In a passion it broke
I pull the black from the gray
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today
