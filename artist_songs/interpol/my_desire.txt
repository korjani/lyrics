Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
We do what we can
Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the earth
These others roam
Besieged by desire

Come on baby you played me out
You play me out
That looked like your chance to me
But you play me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire

Come on baby
Play me out
You lay me out
That looked like your chance to me
You play me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

I've been there
I've been here
Erased

Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Some of us fall to the earth
These others ran
They flee my desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You lay me out
So it's time for a change of heart
You played me out
So I have gave you up
You won't find no scars on me

I've been there
I've been here
Erased

I've been there
I've been near
Erased
