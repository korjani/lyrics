It would be so nice to take you
I only ever try to make you smile
No matter what, we're gonna keep you occupied
But only at your place
Only at your place

It would be no price to pay
I only ever lie to make you smile
All kinds of dust are gonna keep me satisfied
But only at your place
Only at your place

Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find the wrong way
Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find

It's over
It's over
I feel like, the feeling is like
It's over
Why is it so hard to stay away?

Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll play to find that I'm gray
Tonight a special
I only memorize those dates I deny

And I forget why we'll say
Let's seize the day
You won't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you want to
Someday

It would be no price to pay
Hit me again

Don't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you want to
Someday
