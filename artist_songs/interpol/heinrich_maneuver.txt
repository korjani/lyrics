How are things on the west coast?
I hear you're moving real fine
You wear those shoes like a dove
Now strut those shoes we go roaming in the night
Well how are things on the west coast?
You keep it moving to your soul's delight
Now I've tried the brakes
I tried but you know it's a lonely ride
How are things the west coast?
Oh I'd move heaven behind those eyes

Today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings
But I don't want to take your heart
And I don't want a piece of history
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore
My god
'Cause today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings

How are things on the west coast?
Hear you're moving real fine tonight
You wear those shoes side to side
Ah, strut those shoes
We'll go roaming in the night
Well how are things on the west coast?
Yeah but you're an actress
I don't identify

Today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings 
Say it
But I don't want to play the part
And I don't want a taste of victory
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore,
My God
'Cause today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings

Say it 
'Cause today my heart swings 
Yeah today my heart swings

Let it come 
'Cause I've got a chance for a sweet sane life
I said I've got a dance and you'll do just fine
Well I've got a plan with forward in my eyes
Let it come. 
Well I've got a chance for a sweet sane life
said I've got a dance
it moves into the night
Well I've got a plan with forward in my eyes

But today my heart swings
