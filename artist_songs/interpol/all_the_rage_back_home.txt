[Verse 1:]
When she said hey love come over my head abounds
Oh the feeling
And she wept, hold me again, I made no sound
Oh the beating
Then she swore love is never done
So easily
Then we went over again, my head abounds
Oh the feeling

[Pre-Chorus:]
She said you don't need time
Be tame, you won't meet your mate inside
My faith won't lie
He said you don't need mine
Behave, you wanna leave my lady lovers
Of my eighteen summers alone
She said, you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't leave me shakin'
Leave me shakin'

[Chorus:]
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

[Verse 2:]
When she said, love come over my head abounds
Oh, what feeling
She said, you oughtta refine
Be paid, you're gonna see my face in lights
My faith won't lie
My sweet, you don't need mine to 
Come away and just say you'll love me,
Say you'll love me alone
She said you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't see me shakin'
You have been mistaken

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back...
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home
