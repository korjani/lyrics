I just wanna see you people burn in this fucked up world ‘cause now is my turn. 
So, I will bring the shadows up to you, turn your world into something new. 

They call me the evil one, you better hide. 
I’ll take the control of your feelings inside. 
I’m the serpent of Eden, the father of lies. 
I’m the fucking devil, I don’t need no disguise. 

Every time that I close my eyes, I can see the truth inside. 
If I lose control, I will lose myself. 
I wont give up till the end of all has come. 
Every time that I close my eyes, I can see the truth inside. 
I believe in you, you believe in me. 
I won’t give up till the end of time. 

Bow to your master. You’re gonna die. Let us start the dark war, burn down the sky. 
No one can save you, accept your fate. Be prepared for my dark reign of hate. 

Hey, what the fuck is going on? 
You overstepped a mark, when you killed my holy son, 
So now, you better run away from me ‘cause I’m fucking almighty. 

How the hell can you dare to mess with my creation? 
Feel my glory and face your damnation. 
I am the light, the spirit inside. 
I will destroy you tonight. 

Every time that I close my eyes, I can see the truth inside. 
If I lose control, I will lose myself. 
I wont give up till the end of all has come. 
Every time that I close my eyes, I can see the truth inside. 
I believe in you, you believe in me. 
I won’t give up till the end of time. 

Wake me up inside! 
Wake me up inside! 
Wake me up inside! 
I don’t wanna lose myself, love myself. 
Wake me up inside! 
I don’t wanna lose myself. 
Lose myself tonight! 
Wake me up inside! 
I don’t wanna lose myself, love myself. 
Wake me up inside! 
I don’t wanna lose myself. 
Lose myself tonight! 
Lose myself tonight! 
Lose myself tonight!
