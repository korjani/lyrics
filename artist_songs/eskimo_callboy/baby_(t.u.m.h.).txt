Let’s go! 
Baby, I need a chance to make you understand. 
I live my life for you till the biter end. 
I confessed my love to you. 
In my dreams I have faith that you feel it too. 

All my life I’ve been into you. 
So take a deep breath when I say to you: 
Baby, I just wanna make it stop. 
Right now! 
This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared. 
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with. 

It’s tearing up my heart when I’m with you. 
But when we are apart I feel it too. 
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain. 
With or without you. 

So tell me, how can I make you feel my love? 
When will I be the one that you’re dreaming of?
This love is more than I ever felt before. 
And I know you’re the one that is worth fighting for. 

All my life I’ve been into you. 
So take a deep breath when I say to you:
Baby, I just wanna make it stop. 
Right now! 
This chase took a big part of me, 
but you never really cared. 
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with. 

It’s tearing up my heart when I’m with you. 
But when we are apart I feel it too. 
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain. 
With or without you. 

Tearin’ up my heart and soul. 
We’re apart I feel it too. 
And no matter what I do I feel the pain. 
With or without you. [x2]

It’s tearing up my heart 
It’s tearing up my heart 
It’s tearing up my heart when I’m with you. 
But when we are apart I feel it too. 
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain. 
With or without you. 

It’s tearing up my heart when I’m with you. 
But when we are apart I feel it too. 
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain. 
With or without you.

Let’s go! 
No matter what I do, I feel the pain!
