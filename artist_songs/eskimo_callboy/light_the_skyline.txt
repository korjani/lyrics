I gave my heart
you tear it apart
under the ocean
you can’t see the stars
seconds to minutes
hours to days
longing for truth
in your heartly embrace
so let me see
there’s someone somewhere
it doesn’t matter
how far I have to go
so baby
I just want to take you somewhere
I wanna take you to place
where the sun doesn’t shine
don’t touch the meat on my burger baby
or I’ll ram a cucumber in your fucking head
motherfucking bitch
suck my goddamn butterfinger
crapface diet whore
the george forman lean mean fat reducing grilling machine
go to hell I want my fat back
motherfucking bitch
suck my goddamn butterfinger
crapface diet whore
I gave my heart
you tear it apart
under the ocean
you cant see the stars
seconds to minutes
hours to days
longing for truth
in your heartily embrace
so let me see
there’s someone somewhere
it doesn’t matter
how far I have to go
so baby
I just want to take you somewhere
I wanna take you to a place
where the sun doesn’t shine
in your eyes
can’t find the truth
in this mess full of lies
in my heart
I see the stars and
they’re falling apart
and every second every moment I gave so much
noticed the whole world was never really good enough
one heart, one breath
everything’s just a lie
every second every moment
I gave so much
noticed that the whole world
wasn’t good enough
I gave my heart
you tear it apart
under the ocean
you cant see the stars
seconds to minutes
hours to days
longing for truth
in your heartily embrace
it doesn’t matter
how far I have to go
so let me see
there’s someone somewhere
it doesn’t matter
how far I have to go
so baby
I just want to take you somewhere
I wanna take you to place
where the sun doesn’t shine
in your eyes
can’t find the truth
in this mess full of lies
in my heart
I see the stars and
their falling apart
