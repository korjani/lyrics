Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the voodoo circus.
I swear you'll never forget us.
Get low with all of our fellas.
Oh, I got a feeling that I cannot describe.
Can you see the scary faces veiled in that blurry lights?
They wanna play Hide and Seek.
If you lose you are dead.
Follow the voice in your head.

And everything that I gave to you.
Everything that you gave to me.
We always wanna be more.
More than eyes just can see.
And everything that I gave to you.
Everything that you gave to me.
We always wanna be more.
More than eyes just can see.

I swear they' re never gonna get us.
Get low with all of our fellas.
Oh, I'm the voice in your head..
I tell you how to behave 'cause I'm the master of your dreams.
I make you feel like a slave.
If you try to escape Ima treat you like a toy.
Agony is just for the joy.
Can you feel the magic under spotlights of death.
Sometimes being famous feels like a gun to your head.
Can you feel the magic under spotlights of death.
Sometimes being famous feels like a gun to your head.
Feels like a gun to your head
