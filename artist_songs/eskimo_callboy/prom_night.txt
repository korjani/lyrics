Out of my league

Whohoho
It feeels alright
To fall in love
With a girl out of my league
Whohoho
It feels alright
But it hurts to see her with him

And I'm gonna take it
Cause I'm nothing for you
I'm invisible

Fucking cockwhore

Now the time has come tonight
Even if I'm drunk
Come and dance with me
Even if I dream
Feels like eternity

Come closer

To fall in love

Out of my league

Whohooo
It feels alright
To fall in love
With a girl out of my league
Whohoho
It feels alright
But it hurts to see her with him

Touching your pussy
That's one of my favourite dreams
I'm nothing, just nothing for you
My everything, it's just your gorgeous
Body

Prom night, our hearts are getting closer
Tonight it feels alright
