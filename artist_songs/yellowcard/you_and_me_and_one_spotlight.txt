It won't be long now
The music's on loud
We'll sing this song out
And then we'll lie down
Ill hold you close then
Ill let you know when
The space and time bend
And then we'll fall in

Go put on your best tonight
It's you and me and one spotlight
One more show one last time
We are ready

Say you will be all around me
When your body sets your heart free
Say you will be all around me

Ill look for your eyes
To keep me inside
When everything dies
But one last sunrise
And when we stand there together not scared
I'll dry your last tear
And then we'll just have

Go put on your best tonight
It's you and me and not much time
So watch the world burning bright

Say you will be all around me
When your body sets your heart free
Say you will be all around me
Say you'll get me before the ending
Take my body set my heart free
Say you'll get me before the ending

Go put on your best tonight
It's you and me and one spotlight
One more show one last time
It won't be long now

Say you will be all around me
When your body sets your heart free
Say you will be all around me
Say you'll get me before the ending
Take my body set my heart free
Say you'll get me before the ending
Say you will be (you won't be long)
All around me (you won't be long now)
