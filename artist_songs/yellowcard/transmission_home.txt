I'm here reaching out again,
Lead into the wind on my knees
My fear is a memory
It's a reverie and I'm free

I wanna take this crown from my head,
I wanna build something with my hands

I will send a transmission home
To say that I've been out here too long alone
And I wanna come down now
I will send a transmission home
To say I should have called in so long ago
And I wanna come down

Life comes at the speed of light
But there's a place in time for me
When love runs into every day,
Over every place that I've been

I wanna wipe these stars from my eyes,
I wanna search and see what I find

I will send a transmission home
To say that I've been out here too long alone
And I wanna come down now
I will send a transmission home
To say I should have called in so long ago
And I wanna come down

I will send a transmission home
To say that I've been out here too long alone
And I wanna come down now
I will send a transmission home
To say I should have called in so long ago
And I wanna come down
Now
