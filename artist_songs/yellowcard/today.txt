Today is the greatest day I've ever known,
Can't live for tomorrow, tomorrow's much too long.
I'll burn my eyes out,
Before I get out.

I wanted more,
Than life could ever grant me.
Bored by the chore,
Of saving face.

Today is the greatest day I've ever known,
Can't live for tomorrow, I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out,
Before I get out.

Pink ribbon scars that never forget,
I tried so hard to cleanse these regrets.
My angel wings were bruised and restrained,
My belly stings.

Today is,
Today is,
Today is,
The greatest day.

I want to turn you on,
I want to turn you on,
I want to turn you on,
I want to turn you..

Today is the greatest..
Today is the greatest day,
Today is the greatest day,
That I have ever really known.
