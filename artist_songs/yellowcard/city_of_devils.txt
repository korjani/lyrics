Man once sang to me
Look at you saving the world on your own
And I wonder how things gonna be
'Cause the time here it passes so slow
In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live
Find somebody to learn
Boy you gotta love someone more than yourself
I can feel the fire of the city lights burn
It's hard to find angels in hell

[Chorus]

Flying along, and I
Feel like I don't belong and I,
Can't tell right from the wrong, why,
Have I been here so long

In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live

Questions I can't seem to find
To the answers I already have
And you can't see the sky here at night
So I guess I can't make my way back

[Chorus]

What if I wanted you here right now
Would you fall in the fire burn me down
If I wanted you here right now
Would you fall in the fire burn me down
If I wanted you here right now...

In a city of devils we live
In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live
In a city of...

[Chorus]

I don't belong
Don't belong
I've been here too long
Too long
