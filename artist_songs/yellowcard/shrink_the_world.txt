If I could then I'd,
Shrink the world tonight,
So that I would find,
You and me inside. 

A life in love,
A picture of,
A place I'm nowhere near.
A bleeding heart,
A good head start,
To anywhere but here.
Just let me out,
Please let me out,
Before I turn into a box of things,
Reminding me,
How much I'm missing out. (I am missing you.) 

If I could then I'd,
Shrink the world tonight,
So that I would find,
You and me inside.
Of the last good scene,
A film that changes things.
Breaks us, makes us sing,
Leaves us wondering. 

And through the wall my fist you call and then you always run.
So what's it for, the love and war, it's only fair for some.
You saved the girl you saved the world,
Well that's not true it seems.
A lesson learned, speak out of turn,
I bite my tongue it bleeds. (Bite my tongue it bleeds)

If I could then I'd
Shrink the world tonight
So that I would find
You and me inside.
Of the last good scene,
A film that changes things.
Breaks us, makes us sing,
Leaves us wondering. Are you wondering? 

If I could then I'd
Shrink the world tonight
So that I would find
You and me inside.
Of the last good scene,
A film that changes things.
Breaks us, makes us sing,
Leaves us wondering. 

If I could shrink the world tonight.
If I could...
