Hey Mike, if you’re listenin’
I’m callin’ home to tell you how it is
It’s real bad, it’s cold out here
It’s been a long and lonely year
(It’s been a long and lonely year)
It’s been so long

Don’t give up
Don’t give in
Don’t give up
Be my friend

Hey Mike, when the check arrives
I hope you’re gonna buy your girlfriend something nice
A fat ring, a slick new ride
Just let her know it should have been mine
(Just let her know it should have been mine)
Just let her know

Don’t give up
Don’t give in
Don’t give up
Be my friend
Don’t give up
Don’t give in

I’m ending up better for this in the end
You’ll get a letter addressed to a friend
A friend who’s like no friend that I’ve ever known
When this is over…
I’m ending up better for this in the end
You’ll get a letter addressed to a friend
A friend who’s like no friend that I’ve ever known
When this is over I wanted to know
His dark side shows, his dark side grows
Dark side grows

Don’t give up
Don’t give in
Don’t give up
Be my friend
Don’t give up
(Hey Mike, if you’re listening
Be my friend)
Don’t give in
(Hey Mike, if you’re listening
Be my friend)
Don’t give up
Don’t give in
(Hey Mike, will you please return my call?)
Don’t give up
Don’t give in
(Hey Mike, will you please become my friend?)
Don’t give in
Hey Mike, is your shinny car fast enough to catch a shooting star?
The one that we all wished on
