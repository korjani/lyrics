I took a flight headed North
I wasn't waiting anymore
And there I was hoping high
If I could only make you mine

I was safe
In my fortress alone
Then you came
And tore it all down

I wanted to show you
The depth of this dream
The one where I see you
And fall finally
But you're like the winters
That you've always known:
Warm on the inside, while I
Sleep in the Snow

I took a flight headed home
And maybe now we'll never know
But I would lose everything
If it would bring you back to me

I was safe
In my fortress alone
Then you came
And tore it all down

I wanted to show you
The depth of this dream
The one where I see you
And fall finally
But you're like the winters
That you've always known:
Warm on the inside, while I
Sleep in the Snow

(Ooooh, oooh)
(Ooooh, oooh)

(Ooooh, oooh)
I've always run right through
The moments that count
But somehow with you I slow down
(Ooooh, oooh)
And what ever happened
That drove you away?
I know now I can't make you stay

I wanted to show you
The depth of this dream
The one where I see you
And fall finally
But you're like the winters
That you've always known:
Warm on the inside, while I

Wanted to show you
All of my dreams
Things that I buried
And no one could see
But you're like the winters
That you've always known:
Warm on the inside, while I
Sleep in the Snow

You think 
You can leave
Me here
But I know
You'll be back
Next year
You think 
You can leave
Me here
But I know
You'll be back
Next year
