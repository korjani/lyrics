Christmas night, another fight
Tears we cried, a flood
I've got all kinds of poison in, of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryin' to right a wrong
“Just walk away,” those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker, oh they flicker and they float
And I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing, I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling and I always will

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me

May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on
