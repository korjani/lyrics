If I could write to the kid I was before, 
I'd tell him you'll get everything you ever wanted, 
But you will still want more.
Someone's going to tell you
Who should want to be 
So you'll forget the vision that they didn't want to see
And when they give up, cause they will give up say
Here I am alive.

[Hook:]
They say you don't grow up
You just grow old, 
It's safe to say I haven't done both 
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive.
So many people close to me cut me down, 
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground.
But here I am alive.

If I could write to myself
When I was on top of it all, 
I'd say you're going overboard 
and when you're falling 
You're gonna feel so small, 
Someone's gonna tell you that you deserve the worst, 
They'll say you're never coming back
And tell you that you're cursed.
And when they give up, cause they always give up.
Say, here I am alive.

[Hook:]
They say you don't grow up
You just grow old, 
It's safe to say I haven't done both 
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive.
So many people close to me cut me down, 
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground.
But here I am alive.

(Alive alive alive alive alive)

And when they give up, cause they will give up
Say: Here I am alive! 
When they give up, cause they always give up
Say: Here I am alive! 

[Hook:]
They say you don't grow up
You just grow old, 
It's safe to say I haven't done both
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive.
So many people close to me cut me down, 
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground.
But here I am alive.

Here I am alive! 
Here I am alive! 
Here I am alive! 
Here I am alive!
