We seem to have the world
Here in our hands
It's smaller than we thought it was
But now I understand

Some of us survive
Some will get torn
If I lose my confidence
I'll borrow yours

See me now
Hear me out

Look for me tonight
And swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

Take every single year
From then until now
Fables start to change and my head
Reaches through the clouds

When I'm standing trial
I will need you
'Cause every wish we made is finally coming true

See me now
Hear me out

Look for me tonight
And swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

Mirrors show me upside down
The clocks are counting backwards
Here without you I could drown
You pull me to the surface
Ticking time is running out
But we've got symphonies still
Left inside us

Look for me tonight
And swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell
