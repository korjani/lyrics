Storybooks I thought
Were written for my heart
From my fingers fall
With you gone I break
Drifting off in space
Can you hear me call?
I need you, need you
I need you
I need you, need you
I need you

As all these mornings turn
Into brand new days
Everything still hurts
You're so far away
I would dig a hole
Through the earth and crawl
To get to you
To get to you
Wicked dreams they come
When I sleep alone
So I stay awake
Thinking oh oh oh
How I miss her so
How long must I wait?
I need you, need you
I need you
I need you, need you
I need you

As all these mornings turn 
Into brand new days
Everything still hurts
You're so far away
I would dig a hole
Through the earth and crawl
To get to you
To get to you

As all these mornings turn 
Into brand new days
Everything still hurts
You're so far away
I would dig a hole
Through the earth and crawl
To get to you
I need you, need you
I need you
I need you, need you
I need you
