He likes vampires and hit list radio
But turns it off when he hears this one song he knows
And you breathe the windows down
You're driving I-4 as you make your way back home [I-4 - Florida Interstate]
You ride in silence because he will not let go
And you breathe the windows down
It's a new place that you have found

[Chorus:]
I've been up late writing books
All about heroes and crooks
One of them saves you from this
The other one steals you and then, sure, things, fall
And all sure things fall.

Do you remember how we used to get so high
It didn't work at first we tried it two more times
And we could breathe the windows down
I was thinking of the temperature outside
Cool like the water that was running from our eyes
And we could breathe the windows down
It's a new place that we had found

[Chorus]

He can take you all the way to church this time
But don't forget you summed it up in 15 lines

I've been up late writing books
All about heroes and crooks
One of them saves you from this
The other one steals you
Of all of the places I looked
And all of the pictures I took
One of them's here with me now
I'm finally finding out how, sure, things, fall
And all sure things fall.
