Are you there?
Putting all the words together
Painting your new masterpiece
Ocean air
Carrying reminders of that
Perfect pair we used to be

Someday
Everything ends
Can we begin
Finding our way back before
We're too late
And lost in between
The truth and the dream
I've never been more ready to move on

Changing keys
Giving up on me to find familiar things
And try blending in
Know this please
I will not forget the sound of you and me
When we were friends

Someday
Everything ends
Can we begin
Finding our way back before
We're too late
And lost in between
The truth and the dream
I've never been more ready to move on

Bring walls down
Hear all my sound
Let me back in
Love me again
