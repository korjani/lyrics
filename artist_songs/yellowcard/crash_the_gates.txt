Something here, it never looks right
We've been fighting on the front lines for so long
I go digging in the graveyard
To find the remnants of your heart but it's gone

And I won't wait for my revenge
I will seek to see the end
And I won't sing a battle cry
I will let the sleepless lie

Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn
Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn
Sing, "Oh oh oh"

Now it's crying all around us
Smoke rising from the ground up and I stare
You go digging in the graveyard
But the remnants of my heart are nowhere

And I won't crave to feel contempt
I will feed from these forget
And I won't claim a victory
I will revel silently

Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn
Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn

Sing, "Oh oh oh oh"

Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn
Sing, "Oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"
Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn
