Your California washed away
Left us all their bills to pay
Without a friend, without a doubt
We walked it off until we drowned

Well at least we caught some waves
We spit them back at you

And now it feels so saturated
Oh I'd rather be serrated
With my oily legs and long blonde hair
Elevator meets you there

Would you hold me?
Do it, I think I would
Love me?
Won't but I know I think I could

Your New York's city's up all night
Coming down from '99
(But Oh I Love the aroma)
They're city boys, my silly friends
Endless bells and whistling
(Ahhhh)

In the sticks we're barefoot friends
We chew on leaves
And quote Huck Finn
(But Oh I never have told ya)
But Oh all the lights, I know it's a riot
But I can't help the fuss, I'd trade it for quiet

Would you hold me?
To it, I think I would
Love me?
Won't but I know I think I could..Go on
Hold me down, it's over now, I suppose
Your right hand your left brain
Is dialed and fed on control
Hold me down, it's over now, I suppose
Hold me down, it's over now, I suppose

Would you hold me?
Do it, I think I would
Love me?
Won't but I know I think I could
Do it, I think I would
Won't but I know I should

Do it, I think I would
Won't but I know I think I'd
Do it, I think I would
Won't but I know I think I'd
Do it, I think I would
Won't but I know I think I'd
Do it I think I would
Won't but I know I think I should

Your California washed away
Left us all their bills to pay
New York's city's up all night
Coming down from 99
At least we made some waves
We spit them back at you!
