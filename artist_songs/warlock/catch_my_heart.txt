Tonight, the starlight flows into my window
I'm watching the wheels turning round

Tomorrow sleeps in the same old lonely places
Just an empty dream filled with yesterday's faces
Can you tell me, where are my memories ?

I was a dream on fire
I was a dream on fire, burning for you

I wanna dream on forever with you boy,
But I feel so blue.

Catch my heart !
Catch my heart !
Don't you leave me here, so alone

Catch my heart !
Never, never, never, never, never
Catch my heart !
Oh, I can feel it falling down to the ground

Catch my heart.

Too long, too strong
I'd trade all this madness
For your company

When fortune and fame meet,
They ask their price and you pay
Success is the name of the game
But where are my memories ?
