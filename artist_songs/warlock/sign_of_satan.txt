See the evil signs
See some bloody crimes
Now hell's just begun
Satan's having fun

Every house in the street
Has evil seeds
The nature of the beast
Is in our breast

See some children cry
See young women die
In your neighbourhood
Streets are full of blood

Every house in the street
Has evil seeds
The nature of the beast
Is in our breast

Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Crying
Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Dying

See some madman's eyes
They tell you no lies
A million little knives
Destroy a million lives

Every house in the street
Has evil seeds
The nature of the beast
Is in our breast

Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Crying
Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Your dying

Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Crying
Watch out
No-one will listen to your
Watch out
Your dying
Watch out!
