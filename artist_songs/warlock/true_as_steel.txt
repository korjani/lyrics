Go ahead all around the world
Step by step, our flag unfurled
Let your spirit rise
Got to fight for glory
On the wings of an eagle
We're flyin'

Breakin' free
And you're gone
Yes we're movin' on

Stay hard !
True as steel
Stay hard !
We're goin' down in history
Stay hard !
True as steel
Stay hard ! Stay hard !

Hear the bugle call in golden starlight
We're on highway to heaven
Don't hide like a thief in the night
You've got a heart of gold
Courage and pride

Breakin' free
And you're gone
Yes, we're marching on

[BRIDGE:]
We will rock your feelings
You can hear our song In the air !
