Okay

Dreams of Xanadu
Like a rainbow in the sky
I wil lead you to heaven
Close your eyes just let me try

You will listen to my voice
You will listen to my whisper

Sweet emotions fill my love song
And it's only for you
It's only for you

Every song I sing
Is a love song for you !

This song I sing
Is a love song for you !

A love song for you

How I cherish your touch
Believe in you so much
You're my island in the setting sun
And the waves just drift along

How I feel for you
I cannot forget you

It's not hard to understand me
The way I show my love
