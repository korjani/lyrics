Takes a life-time of battle
To wipe down this slate
But it don't really matter
I'm a soldier of fate

Takes a life-time of pure desire
A passionate saint
To watch the children lie dying
Outside of heaven's gate

My heart is a lion
That no-one can tame
But I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling in love

Oh love don't let me walk away from
Love don't let me be afraid of
Love don't wanna fade without love
Oh I must make time for love

I'm standin' on a field of fire
I'm a rollin' thunder
No-one can save
But it don't really matter
To a fortunate slave

The flames gettin' higher
I pray for rain
And I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling in love

Oh love don't let me walk away from
Love don't let me be afraid of
Love don't wanna fade without love
Oh I must make time for love

And my heart is a lion
That no one can tame
But I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling in love

Oh love - don't let me walk away from
Love don't let me be afraid of
Love don't wanna fade without love
Oh I must make time

Love don't let me walk away from
Love don't let me be afraid of
Love don't wanna fade
Without love

Don't let me walk away
Don't let me be afraid
Don't let me walk away
Don't wanna fade without love

Without love ...
