Starlight
Now it's the time
Now I will try
To realise my desire
To strike back

Tonight
I'm prepared for this time
To kill demons of crime
I will fight
Fight for my right
For many years
I've been under a curse

I swear...I've been under a spell
The time is right
I will flee from this hell
Ooh everywhere I see
Ghosts all around
(I'm hellbound) (I'm hellbound)

Moonlight
I'll take my weapon
Of attack
(And) without fear
Of death I wait

Midnight
I feel ghosts
Are all around
(but) I hold my ground
To survive

Fight, fight, fight
I will fight
Fight for my right
For many years I've been
Under a curse

I feel, I've been under a spell
The time is right
I will flee from this hell
Oh, everywhere I see
Ghosts are all around
I'm hellbound
(I'm spell-bound)
