You're only seventeen
Today or tomorrow
You expect a
Surprise

Full of erotic
The first that you can see
But you don't know
She's full of lies

When she passes you by
You believe that she's alright
Your eyes aren't
Seeing clear

When she can sign
She takes possession
You don't know
Her combat mission

Oh it's a dark fate - for you
Dark fate for you
Dark fate for you
Oh dark fate for you

Your fate is sealed
At that moment
When you meet her

Slow but sure
You feel so sad
You can't go back

You're only seventeen
Today or tomorrow
You expect a
Surprise

Full of erotic
The first that you can see

Your eyes aren't
Seeing clear

When she can sign
She takes possession
You don't know
Her combat mission

Oh it's a dark fate - for you
Dark fate for you
Dark fate for you
Oh dark fate for you

Your fate is sealed
At that moment
When you meet her

And slow but sure
You feel so sad
You can't go back

Slow but sure
You feel so sad
You can't go back
