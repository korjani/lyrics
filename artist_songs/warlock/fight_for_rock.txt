Every book on the shelf
Every teacher in school
Every man in the street
Has another golden rule

East and the West
Politician liars
Last S.O.S.
They set the world on fire !

Hear the message
Don't touch my music !
We're ready to fight

Fight for rock !
Fighting for rock
Fight for rock !
We're dying for rock

Steal my money
Take my job and my car
Do anything you want
But don't push your luck too far

East and the West
Politician liars
Last S.O.S.
They set the world on fire !

Hear the message
Don't touch my music !
We're ready to fight

[BRIDGE:]
We are the rocking forces
Soldiers of a different kind
We go to war if you want it
And wipe you out !
