Sun is rising up on the the east side
A chance for everyone
I've been dreaming of the city for long time
Far from my own town

(You) I see
(Will see) My dream
(Your dream) For real
(Come true)
(You) I will
(Will rise) Will rise
(Above) Above
(The rules)

(Love release our mind, you are what we want)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear
Not gonna mess around
(Time has taken our life you are what we need)
Mum and Daddy will be so proud
City please don't let me down

Starlight
Can you give me the fame
Can you hurl me the game
Oh oh starlight
(Starlight have what you need)

Starlight
Can you give me the fame
Can you hurl me the game
Oh oh starlight
(Starlight have what you need)

Time has come for me to be someone
A rich man, a superstar
And faith is all you need to be the one
Far from my own ground

(You) I see
(Will see) My dream
(Your dream) For real
(Come true)
(You) I will
(Will rise) Will rise
(Above) Above
(The rules)

(Love release our mind, you are what we want)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear
Not gonna mess around
(Time has taken our life you are what we need)
Mum and Daddy will be so proud
City please don't let me down

Starlight
Can you give me the fame
Can you hurl me the game
Oh oh starlight
(Starlight have what you need)
