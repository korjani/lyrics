Went too fast I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck

I wanna be your manchild
Let's all go it hog-wild
She said I'll see you later
I always gravitate to her
Let's all meet at the station
No heavy concentration 
We could all hook up there 
The kids are all alright there 

Should we go out later
Showtime for strangers

Dontcha give a fuck anymore now
She's givin up on you now
Do it for the kids they say
It ain't about you anyway

I say we're all grown up now
And sex ain't so safe now
It's all in the groove they say
Doesn't matter anyway

Keep me runnin' like a deer in the headlights
All for nothing I thought
Just the ransom I had bought

About the day I tried to tame her
Never tried to blame her
Just a game that I had bought

Let's all meet at the station
No heavy concentration
The kids are all alright there

Went too fast I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck

Should we go (should we go) out later
(Went too fast I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck)
Showtime (showtime) for strangers
(Went too fast I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck)
