Sometimes I think I'm scared
Sometimes I know
I feel like making love
Sometimes I don't
I feel like letting go 
Maybe not
I feel like giving up
Is all we got

Sometimes is all the time
And never means maybe
Sometimes is all the time
Maybe 

And I'm moving on
And I'm moving on (Sometimes I feel alone)
And I'm moving on
And I'm moving on

Sometimes I make believe 
When we're alone
Machines have taken hold
Can you get me to a telephone
It's just the little things
You used to see 
Am I still that man who makes you who you want to be

I never noticed
How lovely were the aliens
Lovely were the aliens
I never noticed
Lovely were the aliens
Lovely were the aliens
