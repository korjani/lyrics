What is the purpose of tonight my baby
It's my fortune domain act
I need to feel where you're my baby
Are you ready to create

Something new

I don't want it to be a sign
let me take you away

Can't you see the light
I guess we found our way
I love to see your smile
All your faces stark again

Can't you see the light
I guess we found our way
I love to see your smile
All your faces stark again

I don't want it to be all the same

(Can't you see the light)
I guess we found our way

I love to see your smile

All your faces stark again

I don't want it to be all the same
