Trying not to hope too hard for what I want
Trying not to go too far with all the dreaming

Oh, the disappointment, so hard to handle
I'm still in the dark, lighting candles

Late at night I lie awake, think I should go
Catch a train to stranger towns
Where no one knows me

Oh, the disappointment, so hard to handle
I'm still in the dark, lighting candles

Oh, the company you keep, and things you do
SOmething in my heart will not give up on you

Now that I have got somewhere, where will I go?
Love's a train to city lights
Where someone knows you

Oh, the disappointment, so hard to handle
I'm still in the dark, lighting candles
I'm still in the dark, lighting candles
