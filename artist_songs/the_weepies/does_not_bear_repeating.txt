Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

This is not the way I thought it would be
Thought it would be much lighter
This is not the way I thought it would be
Thought it would be much brighter

I thought I saw stars, but it was a rain falling
I thought it was a fight, but it was a game, all in
I thought it was a once, but it was again and again, 
and again, my friend indeed, does not bear repeating, oh
wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo

I could blame somebody else for my heart
For the part that's broken
I could blame somebody else for my heart
But I kept that spoken

I thought I saw stars, but it was a rain falling
I thought it was a fight, but it was a game, all in
I thought it was a once, but it was again and again, 
and again, my friend indeed, does not bear repeating, oh
wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo

To not lie down on solid ground,
not slink around this time
That's over head, boy, that's under head
but the fire makes you the dragon instead

This is not the way I thought it would be
Thought it would be much lighter
This is not the way I thought it would be
Thought it would be much brighter

I thought I saw stars, but it was a rain falling
I thought it was a fight, but it was a game, all in
I thought it was a once, but it was again and again, 
and again, my friend indeed, does not bear repeating, oh
wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
