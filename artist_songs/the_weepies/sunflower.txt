When the sky is grey
Hope just hides away
I'll be your sunflower
When you can't stand up
Even love is not enough
I'll be your sunflower
I shine for you
You know I'd do
Anything for you
When you're in the dark
When you need a spark
I'll be your sunflower
A flint of yellow light
Take me in at night
I'll be your sunflower
I shine for you
You know I'd do
Anything for you
Anything for you
Anything for you
A little smile but your mouth is tight
Gentle pedals crowd around your eyes
I wanna be the company you keep
I wanna be the one you come to when you fall asleep
If there's a place to grow
In your heart let me know
I'll be your sunflower
I shine for you
You know I'd do
Anything for you
Anything for you
Anything for you
Anything for you
When the sky is grey
Hope just hides away
I'll be your sunflower
