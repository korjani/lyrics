I watch the sun go down, I watch the sun go down
Then I wander around, then I wander around
It's here then it's gone 
Love doesn't last too long

I didn't even have time to get it straight in my mind 
To catch up from behind, to see that I was blind
And I wish I was wrong
But love doesn't last too long 

All you lovers in the dark can forget what I said
'Cause it still goes on in my heart
And it still goes on in my head

Rivers to the sea, rivers to the sea
How it is right now is how it's always gonna be 
It's here then it's gone
Love doesn't last too long

I watch the sun go down, I watch the sun go down 
Then I wander around
Then I wander around
Then I wander around
