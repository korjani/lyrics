I went to the market 
though it was threatening rain
I was late to the station
so I missed that train
And the streets filled with umbrellas 
and we all looked the same
But I'm the one who's waiting 
'til the sun comes out again

I was made for sunny days
I made do with grey, but I didn't stay
I was made for sunny days
And I was made for you

Found a book you gave me 
When we were first in bloom
When I thought that you might save me
from the dark side of the moon
Instead we both went walking
through the shadows and the gloom
And we never did stop talking
And you still light up the room

Oh, the nights are longer
Oh, you make me stronger
And the late light lingers on the grass
And the nights are dark but then they pass
They don't seem so deep
I'm still losing sleep but I don't mind,
no I don't mind

Got you a winter jacket 
that our baby wears around
And we chase him through the springtime
and the sleeves drag on the ground
And every hour we're working
and work and play are bound
And every day is Sunday
'cause the sun comes dancing down
