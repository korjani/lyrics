You named me judge the day that I was born
You asked too much to fix what you had torn
Things got out of hand, now I understand

And I'm out of your range
Now it's kind of strange
How we change orbit in our lives
You were kind of a moon outside of my room
I could just feel you nearby
Now I feel you gone
'Cause I know which side you're on
And it's not mine

I walk the line between now and then
It's deep-sea diving with no oxygen
Guess I went somewhere to hide
Far behind my eyes
I willed you there to see
But you never came for me

And I'm out of your range
Now it's kind of strange
How we change orbit in our lives
You were kind of a moon outside of my room
I could just feel you nearby
Now I feel you gone
'Cause I know which side you're on
And it's not mine
And it's not mine
And it's not mine
