[Chorus 1]

3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat

Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Slap
Clap Pat! Clap your hand...
Pat it on your partner hand... right hand
Clap Pat! Clap your hand...
Cross it with your left arm 
Pat your partner left palm
Clap Pat! Clap your hand...
Pat your partner right palm 
Clap Slap! Clap your hand...
Slap your thigh and sing a little song

[Chorus 2]

My mama told me if I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My Aunty told her, I shoulda told her
No I'm not kidding
That's what she told her

3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat

Clap Clap! 
Clap your hands and prepare to Pat
Take your right arm 
Pat your partner?r palm with your right palm

Clap! 
Take your hand back and clap
Clap!
Take your right arm 
Cross your right arm with your left arm 
Pat your partner?r left palm with your left palm
Clap!
Now back with a clap 
Take your hand to your palm and slap your thigh 
And watch the fun materialize 
As you sing this little song: 

[Chorus 2]

(whisper)
[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 (x2)]

That's what she told her
I don't believe It
Yeah right
Can you believe it?

[Chorus 1]
