Yea Baby I'm ready for Christmas
out of all the reindeers you know your the master mind
Run Run Rudolph when you start to fall behind

Run Run Rudolph
Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free raign down
Run Run Rudolph
Cuz I'm feelin' like a merry go round

Send santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?
All I want for Christmas is a rockin' eltric Guitar
And then away went Rudolph racing like a shooting star

Run Run Rudolph
Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
Run Run Rudolph
Cuz I'm feelin' like a merry go round

Play that guitar
Send santa to a girl child what will please you most to get
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a paper jet

Run Run Rudolph
Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
Run Run Rudolph
Cuz I'm feelin' like a merry go round

Run Run Rudolph
Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
Run Run Rudolph
Cuz I'm feelin' like a merry go round
