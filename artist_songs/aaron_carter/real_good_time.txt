[Talking:]
Sometime, someplace
Everybody has words
Fallin' out, and making up
Uh-huh

[Chorus]
Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, adjusting to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time

(Yeah, yeah)
1, 2, 3, 4

You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative
When we have our darker days
We just go our seperate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane

[Chorus]

Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truely justified
When I hear you tellin' lies
I just wanna terorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighbourhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane

[Chorus]

(la la la la la la la)

[Chorus]
