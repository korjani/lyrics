hey hey hey hey hey [X2]

party time, gimme the beat, 
wave your hands from side to side, 
here we go

Some people live for the weekends
seems like such a waste
Counting down 'till the fun begins
what about the other days?

there's Monday night
(there's monday night)
and Tuesday night 
(and tuesday night)
Wenesday, Thursday
Why wait?
365 days!
