Hey girl
Keep your head high
I never said I
Wouldn't be back when I'm
Leavin' on the red eye

Gotta do this show so I can get my dough
Lookin' up at the house on top of the hill
Where we can drop and get ill
A little spot we can chill
Or hide out whenever things get real
Shorty, wontcha tell me how ya feel
If I will
How can I be sure
If your love remains here
Well, I gotta go
Until we get this clear
Ya just gotta know
When you're not there I be so tight
No matter what I try, it won't go right

My shorty
Cause you got my back
My shorty
You keep it real like that
My shorty
I wanna be where ya at
My shorty
That's why I feel like that

Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

On tour 2 months 8 weeks 60 days later
I threw so many groupies off
One I even made her cry
Had to tell her I really didn't hate her right
Couldn't wait awhile
'cause we had to say goodbye
I never thought that I
Would never see that day that I
Fall for her the way that I did
So I will say that I
Never stray cause I find a better way when
I hold it down and keep it tight
Could never say goodbye

My shorty
'cause you got my back
My shorty
We keep it real like that
My shorty
I wanna be where ya at
My shorty
That's why I'm FELLIN' like that

Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

My shorty...
My shorty, ain't around

My shorty...
My shorty, ain't around

Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

Shorty ain't around...
(My shorty ain't around)
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
