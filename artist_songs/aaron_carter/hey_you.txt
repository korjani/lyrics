Seen you around, heard you really like me

I see it in your eyes
So what do you say

Hey you, whaddya know
You got your hands in your pockets
And you walk real slow
Hey you, whaddya say

Gonna make your day
Hey you, are you talking to me
Wanna tell you what I want
Wanna try, wanna see
Hey you, hey you
Whaddya say, whaddya say

Hey hey hey hey

Hiding away. Hopin' that you'll call me
I can't seem to get you off my mind
There you are, standing on the corner
You said "Hi, I lost your number.
Gimme a sign!"

I know you really wanted me baby
I see it in your eyes
So what do you say

Hey you, whaddya know
You got your hands in your pockets
