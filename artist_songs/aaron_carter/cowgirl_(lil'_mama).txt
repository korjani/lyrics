Okay, this is how it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the play-ground
Chillin', my father honked his horn at me
Said I have a show in Texas
And I gotta leave
Texas, wow I've never been
Maybe I can find a new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up my bags on my way
Signin' autographs as I run to catch the plane
I seen her, chubby cheeks with long braids
Cute face, same age
She played hard to get, as I offered out my name
She just walked away with a smile

Oh my little cowgirl

Okay, now the plane landed
She's been on my mind so much I can't stand it
My manger kept rushin' me to go
I tried to look for her. I'd give a ticket to the show
I thought I see a cowboy hat. But everyone was ready
And our luggage was packed
Hesitant for leavin' my heavensent cowgirl
We ran off to the hotel
As I practisin' in the hotel lobby
She was on my mind full time
The fellas tryin' to cheer me up
I came down with a case of Puppy Love
I went back to havin' fun
Dancin' makes ya thirsty
Plus it was time for lunch at the hotel restraunt
Order me some burgers and fries
Then to my surprise, walked in my cowgirl

Break it down little lady

Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on

Break it down little lady
Break it down little lady
Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on

And now I'm on the stage
Performing infront of a capacity
Screamin' guys and screamin' girls
But still no sign of my cowgirl
As I head to the other front part of the stage
There she stood, with a smile on her face
My cowgirl, took her by the hand
Brought her onstage and I started to dance
With my cowgirl
