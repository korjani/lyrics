I remember the day we met 
Almost like a fairy tale 
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet 
I never gonna forget 
Now my knees went weak 
When you said "hi" 
And then you held my hand 
And look me in the eye 
I almost died, deep inside 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
I heard about how wonderful love can be 
But in my mind I never could have dreamed 
Such a fantasy 
Maybe it's destiny 
I share myself with you in a special way 
I'm not a little boy 
I never gonna leave you 
And I'm gonna say 
That everything is okay 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x] 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile.
