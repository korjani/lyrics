(Come On)
That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
Sing a song, you know we don't stop

Yo my man. Get behind the wheels
Time to cruise. You snooze, you lose
Let me introduce you to my friends
In the other car right behind us
And my other friends in the car
Right behind them, start a Caravan
Crank it up and let it pump
We're gonna make a kriss kross jump
It's the drivin' anthem
And when it's time to hit the road
Feel the heat, crash
Ready to explode

When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me
Didyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so

Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all
Everybody like that y'all
Everybody come and follow me

The caravan rolls out to the movies
We need atleast 10 rows
As we roll east

And then it's time to
Go to the Backstreet show
Or the Britney Spears show
Cuz it's starring me, yo
We'll be in the crowd
Hypin' up the party
I want the best reception
For each and everybody
So when I hit the stage
Show me love, don't be rude
And afterwards get my brother
Burn rubber dude

When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so

Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all
Everybody like that y'all
Everybody come and follow me

That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up

That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
Sing a song, you know it don't stop

In every single city
People singing in their cars
From mommies to daddies
Who drive cuz they're daddies
In every single bus, baby
To and from school
Everybody feels a rush
And it's time to act cool

When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so

Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all
Everybody like that y'all
Everybody come and follow me
