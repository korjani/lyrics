I wanna see ya bounce

Welcome to the party 
This is one of a kind
Like a hot chilli pepper
It'll blow your mind
Don't know if you can take it
So now we're gonna shake it
And if you can't
getcha in house arrest

It's like this 
We've got the crazy notion
DJ's treating us with a jumpin' potion
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air
Oh yeah

Ya gotta get up
to get it down
(Come on, come on)
When the beat kicks in
and you feel the scream
Just don't stand around

Are you ready to jump
Gonna funk around
??
Let the fun begin
Don't stop now cause I wanna see ya bounce

[Chorus]

Livin' it up
Cause we're here to party
With a bouncey, bouncey
Gonna make you happy
Playin' the disco bongo with me
And a bouncey, bouncey
Come dance with me
[X2]

Stop the tracks
Can't you see it's not enough
Find the bliss
And he's coming on tough
They say turn it down
What'd ya say
No way

The sounds are pumpin'
From the DJ
Crank it up
Cause we're gonna ??
The original Millenium
We're gonna rock it
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air
Oh yeah... 

Ya gotta get up
to get it down
(Come on, come on)
When the beat kicks in
and you feel the scream
Just don't stand around

Are you ready to jump
Gonna funk around
??
Let the fun begin
Don't stop now cause I wanna see ya bounce

[chorus]

Ya come on
Everybody jump up and down
Let's get it on
I wanna see you have a good time

Bounce

Ya come on
I wanna see ya shout it out
I wanna see you bounce
Let's shake the floor
Here we go, we're gonna bounce
Throw your hands up...

[chorus]
