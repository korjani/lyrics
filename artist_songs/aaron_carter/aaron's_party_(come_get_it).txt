[Talking:]
Here's a little bit of old school for ya, 
That goes a little something like this...

I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year

All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though

I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone

Have a good time...

The door bell rings cuz the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Nobody can do it like Aaron can)

First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I'm guessin' where I'm goin' cuz I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said

People all around you gotta 
(Come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud 
(Come get it) 
Jump all around, come on 
(Come get it) 
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what 

Na na na na... Na na na na...

Things are goin' great 
Then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellows, yo, ya gotta get out

(Hey man I heard this was an open house) 
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)

Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion

I turned around and 
Another kid broke the lamp 
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later 
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her

People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it) 
Jump all around come on
(come get it) 
What?
(come get it)
Say it again here we go, uh
(come get it) 

People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
From the left to the right, make noise
(come get it) 
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what

Aaron C's in the house, here we go 
Come with it

Break it down
(go go go go go...)

Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double 
I'm dead (your done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree

Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin around the house 
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test

The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left 
(AARON!!!???!!!) 

Grounded

[Chorus]

Aaron C's in the house, come on 
(come get it)
Uh uh what what

[Fades...]
