Calling you lovable
How are you feeling now?
Making it all above
Falling for you somehow

I can't refuse you walking along the lonely way
Wish I could hear you everytime but all you say

Is I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good
I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good

Calling you lovable
How are you feeling now?
Making it all above
Falling for you somehow

I can't refuse you walking along the lonely way
Wish I could hear you everytime but all you say

Is I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good
I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good

Calling you lovable
How are you feeling now?
Making it all above
Falling for you somehow

I can't refuse you walking along the lonely way
Wish I could hear you everytime but all you say

I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
I'm doing so good
