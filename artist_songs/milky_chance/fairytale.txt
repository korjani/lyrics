You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

Now we should run away
I can hear them tapping on the ground
Where do we wanna go?
I know an ambush where we won't be found
And so we went to the place, honey
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there was no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon
And all the shining lights
In the night

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale

Hope you gonna stay

You are my fairy-tale

Hope you don't run away
