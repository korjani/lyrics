Only jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be

Blood is running down the river
I feel like fond of destruction

Is destiny playing a dirty trick on you
When you were not the one you wanted to be

Can't you see the pain inside
Over the years we can hide
How long will you be able to stand yourself
If you think no one is stopping you

Only jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be
