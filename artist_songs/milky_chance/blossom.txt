Yes I'm tired of all this talking
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
But who am I, oh to say this
'Cause everything you hear is just words, yeah

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
Cause the truth is

'Cause all I need is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

And I'm tired of constant sorrow
'Cause everything you get is just worse
So what's the point of going somewhere
When everyone you see is just nothing but confused

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
Cause the truth is

'Cause all I need is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

'Cause all I need is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
