Give me something I haven't seen
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all

Give me the time but not an age
Give me a look but not the rage
Give me the feel for where I'll go
Give me it all

Give me the way it could have been
Give me the ghost that's on the screen
Give me the way but not the means
Give me it all

Give me something I haven't seen
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all

I called you up
3 times last night
Running through the streets
Bloody, from a fist fight

Keep you warm
Keep you there
Wanna keep you all

See you there, wanna see you some day
As you look back, I'm pulling away
You caught the bus and I caught the train
All that remains are words in the rain

Ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh 
Ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh 

Give me the shade of a thunder cloud
Give me a good-bye said out loud
Give me the day with no memories
Give me it all

I know you could be here with me
By the rain and the palm of the valley
But you're there by the tube stop in the freezing rain

See you there, wanna see you some day
As you look back, I'm pulling away
You caught the bus and I caught the train
All that remains are words in the rain, rain

Ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh 
Ooooh, oooh, oooo-oooooh 

So solo, I see you there
You fall like a fifty weight
The time goes
I'll be right there
I feel, I feel there's a fork in the road

Oh-Woah-woah [x2]
