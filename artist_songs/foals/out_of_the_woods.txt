It's times like these when I'm on my way out of the woods,
Never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good.
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods.
I'll never be afraid again now I'm out of here for good.

It was just a dream,
The most beautiful place I've seen.
The white caps and the pines,
Ripped our nations in the sea.

It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods,
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good.

Now I've finally found,
All my friends are in the clouds.
Alone now, in my head now,
All alone now, in my head.

It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods,
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good.

Now I've finally found,
All my friends are in the clouds.
Alone now, in my head now,
All alone now, in your head.

And I've waited just so long,
To sing you this final song.

Time keeps ticking, time keeps pushing, time keeps rolling along.
