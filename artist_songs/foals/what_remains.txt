Oh, I see you in your cobra nest
All dressed up in your Sunday best
In the opal morning light
See your gun there, shining bright
Shining bright
Now the storm is on its way
Coming here to break the day
Steaming rain
Oh, you go shoot me down
Take my halo, yoke and crown
Yoke and crown

'Cause I've been to the darkest place I know
You, my dear, shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones

Now you go softly soft
Picking out better bones than your own
Oh, I see you creep in the dark
Sticking pins into the rain
To wash away

And I've been to the only place I know
It's just bones
So you, my dear, shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones

Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones

So how can love bear to see you, bear to see you go alone?
Black and blue, this beating heart's got the same blood as your own,
As your own.
So you, my dear, shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones
And I've been to the darkest place you know
It's just bones

Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
Just bones, bones
