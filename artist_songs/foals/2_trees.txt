Help yourself, help the rest
Give blood away, give blood today
Each drop away
Help yourself, help the rest
Inhale exhale
Lungs paper frail
Light up away, go

Don't let go, just breathe slow
So hold on, it will pass
Don't give up, don't let go
Grey clouds, they'll, they'll break up

Rest yourself, rest your head
Be still, play dead.
Learn to acquiesce
Forget all the rest
Free yourself, free your head
Don't shy away,
Open your veins
In wet summer rain, go

Don't let go, just breathe slow
So hold on, it will pass
Don't give up, don't let go
Grey clouds, they'll, they'll break up

Just breathe slow.
