Sun up we wait
All day
Sun up we wait
All day all day

The hell outside kept away
If only we could move away
From here

This is how
We build a place
An aviary for today
An aviary for today

Let's disappear till tomorrow
Let's disappear till tomorrow
Dis-a-ppe-ar
dis-a-ppe-ar
dis-a-ppe-ar ar ar ar

Blow up these play parades
Let's go
To an aviary far from home
To an aviary far from home

A one hand clap is me and you
And you and you and you
While the hell outside kept away
If only we moved away

Dis-a-ppe-ar
Dis-a-ppe-ar
Dis-a-ppe-ar ar ar ar

Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away

Sun down now we have built
Our place
An aviary forever
An aviary forever
Forever forever
