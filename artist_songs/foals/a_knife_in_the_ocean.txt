When I come to walk the line the fire may come but we'll be just fine
When I go to walk the line the fire, it will come but we'll be just fine
Mouth of the ocean, be well spoken, watch your P's and Q's
Now that we're older, the future is colder but what is there to do?
I'll walk the line, I'll be just fine, I'll be right back on time
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it, we'll never be undone

Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

And now our parents are long departed, who can finish the songs they started?
Bodies are broken but it's just a token of what is surely to come
Unstitch the suture, please pause the future, so I can collect my things
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it, we'll never be undone

Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

When I go to walk the line the fire, it comes but I'll be just fine

Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, all lost and, oh, all lost, to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
All that's left, all that's left is the echo of a roaring sea
Long gone, long gone to the trace of a memory
What came of the things I once believed?
All that's left, all that's left is the trace of a memory
