Step out, aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you

Step out, aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you
Oh, I'm coming down for you

But I'm falling, deeper down I go
And I'm falling, down the grounds beneath the road
Now I'm falling, deeper down I go
And I'm falling, deeper now I known
And I'm falling, deeper down the shore
And I'm falling, as the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below

Step out, aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you

Step out, aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you
Oh, I'm coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you...
