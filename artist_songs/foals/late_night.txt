Oh I hope that you somebody, 
someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again 
when I was in doubt
Oh now Mama, do you hear me? 
I'm calling out your name
Oh now Mama, do you hear me? 
I'm calling out your name, 
I'm calling out your name

I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found
And I know the place another way, 
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear? 
It's coming after me
I'm calling out your name, 
I'm calling out your name

Stay with me, stay with me

Did you throw your heart away? 
Oh I know just what I say
Did your phone cut in the way? 
Being still downtown I say
And I know you ran away, 
oh I know but I'm feeling okay
And I found love and fear won't go, 
and I found love and feeling won't go
See you walk away, feeling okay now, 
happy now, happy now?

Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
