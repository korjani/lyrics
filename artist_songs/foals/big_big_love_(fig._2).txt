See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
Cracks in our hearts and heads

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we till
Crash down fury red
Crash down fury red

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
Cracks in our hearts and heads

Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
All could be well

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

A place where we can hide

Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
All could be well

Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
Oh electric shocks, no
