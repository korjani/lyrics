You want to push me like I don't mind
You want to break me but not this time
You underestimate the moment you shove
You've got no idea what I'm capable of
No, no you don't

You think I'm going to back down
You better think again
I've always said
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
You're going to suffer
Hit me, I'll hit back harder
The bigger you are, the harder you fall
It's your darkest hour
Hit me, I hit you harder
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back

You are the darkness and I am the light
You are the fallen and Heaven don't lie
So, so, so step back you're crossing the line
If I told once I've told you one thousand times
No, no you don't

You think I'm going to back down
You better think again
I've always said
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
You're going to suffer
Hit me, I'll hit back harder
The bigger you are, the harder you fall
It's your darkest hour
Hit me, I hit you harder
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back

Strike back [x6]

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
You've got my back against the wall
You've got my back, you're going to fall

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
You're going to suffer
Hit me, I'll hit back harder
The bigger you are, the harder you fall
It's your darkest hour
Hit me, I hit you harder

The bigger they are
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
The harder they fall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
The bigger you are, (the bigger you are) the harder you fall
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
When my back's against the wall
I strike back, I strike back, I strike back
