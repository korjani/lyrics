God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ the Savior
was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we had gone astray

[Chorus:]
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy!
O tidings of comfort and joy!

From God our Heav'nly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Bro't tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name

[Chorus]
