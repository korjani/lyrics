Love is skin and bones we don’t want to be 
Wasting all our breath on things that we don’t think that we’ll need 
Love is skin and bones no one else can see 
Behind the door we are unhappy that’s between you and me 
That’s between you and me 

Love is skin and bones, too many mouths to feed 
We’ve made an art of neglecting what we don’t want to see 
Love is skin and bones trying to set us free 
I can feel the pulse is dying in captivity 

Someday, someday soon we’re going to open our eyes 
Break out the windows and fly, I want to see it 

Love is skin and bones screaming inside of me 
Like a siren on the crest of the emergency 
Love is skin and bones for the world to see 
To remind us that the heart will never hold our pity 

Look over my love while she sleeps tonight 
Look over my love while she sleeps tonight, tonight 

Someday, someday we’re going to open our eyes 
Break out the windows and fly, I want to see it 

Someday, someday when all the words feel wrong 
You’ll have a heart beating strong, it will go on and on 

Someday, someday when all of the words feel wrong 
You’ll have a heart beating strong, it will go on and on.
