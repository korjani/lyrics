Must have thought I was so strong
Might have ever thought I was the one for this all along

But I can't even dream
Or imagine how it seems
To carry the weight of this crown

[Chorus:]

It's not as easy as it seems
To carry the weight of your dreams
Hiding in the shadows
It's not as easy as it seems
With Pharaoh and angel and everything in between (counting on hope)

I might have come to a similar conclusion
Only mixed up in the wake of confusion
That the glamour was mine
Though the power divine
To carry the weight of this crown

I don't know why I see your fire
Carry me over
Stay this way...
