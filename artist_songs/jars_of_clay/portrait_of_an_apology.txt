Look what I've done
This picture I've painted
It looks like my heart
Or what still remains

Convinced of the weight
Your interpretations
Are not what I see
I wish they could be

I remember it much redder
I remember it much brighter

[Chorus:]

Can you stay for a while
Try to imagine this
Could you be for a while
I can't remember it
Could you fall for a while
I can't escape from this

I'll try to explain
The way that the frame
Doesn't quite fit the image
Or surround the edge

It stands on display
What do you see?
Behold all the new grey
What's become of the old me

I remember it much redder
I remember it much brighter

[Chorus]

Calling, crying, ashamed of what I am not
Really failing, falling into this cage and I can't escape
I can't escape

Look what I've done
This picture I've painted
Doesn't quite fit
Or surround the edge
I remember it much redder

[Chorus]

I can't escape, I can't escape, I can't escape
