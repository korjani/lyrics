World without end, are you ending? 
Labeled a friend you’re unfriending 
Disposable me, pose-able you 
Any position we want to do 

Another song you forget by the ending 
Plastic we don’t know we’re spending 
My favorite shows have all cancelled 
And every patent is pending 

Look in my eyes, touch my face 
We’re limping along in the human race 

Our jeans have become complicated 
The promise of love is downgraded 
Faith in available excess 
Proof we were destined to care less 

It’s life on the wrong side of rapture 
Dismiss what we can’t manufacture 
Compassion just sounds like complaining 
Hit the keys but the notes aren’t sustaining 

Look in my eyes, touch my face 
We’re limping along in the human race
The sound of your heartbeat is out of place 
We're limping along in the human race

We lost everything in the fractures 
Uprootings and wanted departures 

Look in my eyes, touch my face 
We’re limping along in the human race 
The sound of your heartbeat is out of place 
Limping along in the human race

So, look in my eyes, touch my face 
We’re limping along in the human race
