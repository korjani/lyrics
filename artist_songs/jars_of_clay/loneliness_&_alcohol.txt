The sound of television creeping through the halls 
Left in the wild like a tree pulled from the dirt 
You fill the sky with burning arrows from your heart 
Throw your bottles out to sea and watch them float away 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
You bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol 

Hide your diamonds in the dirt in careful rows 
Let your doubt unravel all their, all their pretty bows 
‘Cause your heart is broken by the things you love 
And your light, it carries but it’s not enough to change the weather 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
Bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol 

You get buried under all these lines, all this light, all these lies 
You get buried under all these lines, all this light, all the time 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
Bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
Bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol
