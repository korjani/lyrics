[Intro:] 
I wanna send this one out to vanilla ice cream pudding pie
That stayed with me in the hood do or die

This one goes to my almond joy
My banana that never split
The one that stuck with me when I ain't have [?]
Before I had the bling bling
I thought I'd end up in Sing-Sing
Who would have thought
That we'd be doing our thing
I know I did a lil cheatin
But once I got caught (I broke)
I sent a dozen roses, you sent them back and told me to go to [/]
But girl you know that

You take me as I am
Even though my fam don't understand
That's why I put that rock up on your hand
You take me as I am
Even though my girls can't understand
Why I choose you as my man
Cause you take me as I am
My man
You're my girl [x4]

When I was rocking jellies
And had lil belly
Who would have ever thought you'd think
I was sexy [so sexy]
I stayed with an attitude, I admit I cam off rude
But still you loved me
I know I get on your nerves sometimes
And I don't know why

You take me as I am
Even when my girls can't understand
Why I choose you as my man
Cause you take me as I am
You take me as I am
Even though my fam don't understand
That's why I put that rock up on your hand
You're my girl
You're my man [repeat]
You're my lady
My baby
You're my baby
My honey

You're my ocean my breeze when
I'm blowin my [?] at night
You're the sun that shines when the darkness strikes at night
You're the love of my life, you're my girl
You're my wife, you're my everything
You're mine and I'm yours, you take me like I am
Wait a minute
Can't believe you take me as I am
Even when they don't understand why you love me
I choose you as my man
Cause you take me as I am
You take me as I am
Even though my fam don't understand
That's why I put that rock up on your hand
