You picked me up when I was down with nothing 
And gave me something, I can't face the world without 
You showed me just enough to fuel my fire 
My desire, never wanna live without it 

Both of us need something like we had before 
We can't keep fighting like this anymore 
This love affair is breaking my heart 

All the pushing and the shoving 
When we know that we ought to be loving 
And the lying and the cheating 
When we ought to be loving and squeezing 
Come on come on 
Lay down your guns and surrender 

Remember days we thought would last forever 
Nothing better but we let them slip away 
Cause in the end we make the bed we lie in 
Lets start trying 
What's the point of talking about it 

Never seems to make it better 
If we can't get on together 
Take a chance and try a brand new start 

All the pushing and the shoving 
When we know that we ought to be loving 
And the lying and the cheating 
When we ought to be loving and squeezing 
Come on come on 
Lay down your guns and surrender
