Well, I thought nothing was wrong, nothing was right
I turned to you but you were no where in sight
I left it too late and maybe I hurt your pride
I should have thought of you, now you've changed your mind

And just like a well your love has run dry
Loneliness was falling from the sky

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone

Well, I missed all the signs, never read between lines
And all I can say to you is that my love was blind
It's breaking my heart knowing right from the start
You tried to reach for me, now we had to part

And just like a well your love has run dry
Loneliness was falling from the sky

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

Well, I'll tell you no lies, you've opened my eyes
Made me feel like a man again
You've walked out that door and you left me alone
I broke down and I cried 'cause I don't think I can make it alone

Oh, listen, I would sail the deepest ocean
Just to be by your side again
And all I want is for you to love me
Just say you love me again, again, again, again

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I'm like a man with no heart, I just don't belong
I can't help it when your love is gone
And it's all I can do just to carry on
I can't help it when your love is gone

I can't help myself when your love is gone
Your love is gone
