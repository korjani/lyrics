Ah yeah, let me tell you all about it
I've been thinkin about you night and day
Sure been restless since you went away
You took something from me against my will
Touched a nerve in me thats tingling still
You just snuck up behind me
When my resistance was low
And nows a hell of a time to find i can't let you go
Got your first letter just the other day
Since I got it I can't put it away
I just sit and read it over and over and over again
As if the words that you wrote could bring this hurt to and end

Well you just left me here waiting
Left a wound that won't heal
God your so far away you don't know how i feel
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
And I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know I'd die to be with you tonight

I count the hours each time till your gone
I don't have to let you leave me
It makes no sense at all
If i have to follow you all around the world
I'd be willing to do anything to get to you girl

You just left me here waitin
Left a wound that won't heal
God your so far away you don't know how i feel
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
And I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know I'd die to be with you tonight
Ah yeah
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know I'd die to be with you tonight
Oh
I'd die to be with you tonight
Ah ha ha ha
I'd die to be with you tonight

I count the hours each time that your gone
Oh
I'd die to be with you tonight
I don't have to let you leave me
It makes no sense at all
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
I'd die to be with you tonight
I'd die to be with you
