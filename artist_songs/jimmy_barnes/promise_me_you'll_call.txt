When you came along you were everything
Nothing else compared to the love you gave
Say it's going to last, say you'll never leave

Now that love's around you are everywhere
Nothing else I found like the love we shared
Say it's going to last, say you'll never leave

If I gave you all that you want
If I gave you all that you need
If I gave you all that you want
Will you promise me, promise me you'll call
Won't you promise me you'll call
