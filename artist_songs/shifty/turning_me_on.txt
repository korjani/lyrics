[Chorus:]

These other girls, have been there too,
Nothin' that I wouldn't do, for you, for you,
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on)
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on)
You just keep on turning me on

[Verse 1:]

Now I've never had the feelin' that I get from you,
It's hard to believe but I know it's true,
You leave me breathless, you're precious, you're beautiful in every way,
At first I second guessed it but our love won't fade,
Every day I grow closer, with every word you say,
Me and you have got something that no one's taking away,
There were times that I thought I was in love before,
I've been let down, I'm less now, shifty's got an angel and it's all for you,
It's all for you, I ain't worried cause you know exactly what to do,
And when everything's wrong you make it all ok,
I come home stressed and you take it away,
It's the little things you do, that mean so much,
I need your love, your kiss, your touch,
And it never gets old, I still feel the rush,
You got everything I want and I can never get enough.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]

Now there's me and you, and everyone else,
I remember when I used to only think about myself,
But you changed that fast, love is changing me,
I used to be a playa then we came to be,
True chemistry, I believe you're my destiny,
Cause I'm free when you're next to me,
You're a lady in the living room, a freak in the bedroom,
Oh so for real when I'm bumpin' to neck tunes,
You can nibble on my neck, don't stop too soon,
Let me know before you cum so I can cum with you,
This is sexual healin', and I'm a sex fiend, 
So let's stay together like my name was Al Green,
Yea, I got you, like I told you so, 
I'ma hold you in my arms and never let go,
And at first I smiled, and then you blushed,
You got everything I want and I can never get enough.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

The way you move, just turns me on,
You steal my breath, you turn me on,
You keep me up all night long,
You just keep on turning me on,
The way you move, just turns me on,
You steal my breath, you turn me on,
You keep me up all night long,
You just keep on turning me on.

(alright)

[Chorus x2]
