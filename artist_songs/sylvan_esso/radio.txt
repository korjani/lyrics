Gimme a new single
Make me a new baby
Gonna eat all the candy while you straddle and lay me
Gonna to know all the words before you come on top
And I sing them back at you while you try to nap
While the world rides on, we're so happy to be listening to our radio
Our saviour, oh
While the world melts on down we're so happy to be listening to our radio, now break it on down slow

Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
3.30
Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio

Now don't you look good sucking american dick
You're so surprised they like you
You're so cute and so quick
Singin' I've got the moves of a tv queen
Folk girl hero in a magazine
Faking the truth in a new pop song
Don't you wanna sing along

Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
3.30
Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
3.30

Highway blues and gasoline fumes, it's all I seem to make while I'm playin' my tunes
I know the rules
I ask for it too
But I just keep on yelling, keep on running, never stopping
Do you got the moves to make it stick yeah to get the clicks yeah
Technicolor our every move
Can you keep them coming like a machine yeah
The old Blue Jean, yeah
What can we do to get you on the news?

Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
3.30
Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
3.30

Slave to the radio, wait till they forget you though, slave to the radio

Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio
