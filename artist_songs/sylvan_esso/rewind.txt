Bailing in the red, blue, green
I'm learning how to think
Learning how to shake that thing
Learning how the grown ups dream
Those friends you're making on the screen
They teach you how to be, to be
You reinvent and feel that quick
And then you're back in love again

Watch them, take it on back
Take it on back, do the rewind, yeah
Moving so fast, backward attack
Do it again, light up the room
Watch them, bring it on back
Bring it on back, do the rewind, yeah
Moving so fast, backward attack
Do it again, light up the room

Original to the other side, whatcha try to be?
Are you a rewind baby with so much to lose and no present?
Are you a rabid player and a one shot ski?
Or are are you splashing up a fantasy?
