Hey, mami, I know what you are, mami [6x]

She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast
Oh our lady she don't know how she go
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walk like a babe, hey

Her image it lasts and I know
She floats along as she goes
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town

Hey, hey, mami, hey, hey, mami
I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want
Sooner or later
The dudes at bodegas
Will hold their lips and own this shit
Coming to terms on a chivalry tip
But our hero—she don't know the gravity she owns
As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall

Hey, mami, I know what you are, mami [4x]

She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast
Oh our lady she don't know how she go
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walk like a babe, hey

Look at that ass and I know
She floats along as she goes
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town

Hey, hey, mami, hey, hey, mami
I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want

Sooner or later
The dudes at bodegas
Will hold their lips and own this shit
Coming to terms on a chivalry tip
But our hero—she don't know the gravity she owns
As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall

Hey, mami, I know what you are, mami [4x]
