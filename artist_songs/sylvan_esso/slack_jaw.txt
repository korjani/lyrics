I got all the parts I wished for
I've got everything I need
Sometimes I'm above water
But mostly I'm at sea

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

It's not like I got hurt or broken
Or ruined on the way
It's an ache and it shines through me
A swallow in a cage

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

Is it a sign? Or just a landmine?
Or a feeling roaming free?
It's overtaken me
Gonna hold it 'til it dries up
Or pocket it for another day
If it's me I cannot give up
I'd rather that she stayed

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

I got all the parts I've wished for
I got everything I need
Sometimes I'm above water
But mostly I'm at sea

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back
