I've never taken this curve
Drivin' this fast before
A glowing stop sign
But both lanes are mine
No seat belts attached to my door

Well my speed meter don't work
So I'm gonna to guess ninety-five
Well maybe I'll fix it
And maybe I won't
It depends on my being alive

Well my bottle of bourbon is gone
It flew away all by itself
So if ever you find it
My photo will go behind it
In memory of me on your shelf

Well it's been raining all day
And it's been raining all night
A slip 'n slide highway
And I'm moving sideways
I'm loose but my steering wheels tight

Well my '63 Ford is a bull
She's four thousand pounds at least
But metal surrenders
When oak trees meet fenders
And engines go through the front seat

Well I lost control in the curve
And a gas line broke in the wreck
I walked from the ashes
With just a few scratches
My crucifix warm on my neck

Well my good Lord was with me tonight
Just ridin' beside me tonight
And now we're just talking
We're hitch hiking walkin'
We'll see you in Concord tonight
