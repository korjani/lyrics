Tell her, tell her what I'm thinkin'
Tell her, tell her what I'm dreamin'
And, hey, she just might just understand
Baby would you listen to me
Come across the kitchen to me
And I will tell ya best I can
'Bout how I know you love me
And how I want to love you back

People, people, people, they make it sound so easy
They say just do what your heart tells you to
But sometimes you cannot feel it
Sometimes you cannot hear it
Sometimes it won't talk back to you
And yeah I know you love me
And yeah I want to love you back
And how I know you love me
And how I want to love you bad

Far away I hear the rhythm of a song
Far away I get the feeling I belong, and so do you
And it goes like this

Oh no, no, don't want to leave you
Oh no, I want to keep you
Oh but I want to let you be
Oh no, I don't want to hear you 
Say I don't want to be near you
Oh but I've got to set you free
And how I know you love me
And how I want to love you back
And yeah I know you love me
And yeah I want to love you bad

Far away I hear the rhythm of a song
Far away I get the feeling I belong, and so do you
And it goes like this

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
