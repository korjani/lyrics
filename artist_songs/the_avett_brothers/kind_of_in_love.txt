She's as sweet as the summer time
And strong as the sunshine
And I don't want to know her
I let myself down

I'm cold as a winter's storm
I'm soft as a grind stone
And I can't do a thing
To flag my life down

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' 
that I'm kind of in love with you?

She's good as a mystery
A salesman for misery
And I am bankrupt
In debt to my knees

Big brown eyes and curly hair
I wonder if she sees me stare
I can't say why I've fallen
Babe, please have mercy

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' 
that I'm kind of in love with you?

We sink like a ball and chain
If I knew more than your first name
Those eyes you got can't fool me
I know how this goes

We'd wrap ourselves in conversation
You tell lies and try my patience
Bite my tongue in frustration
Or you slap my face

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' 
that I'm kind of in love with you?
