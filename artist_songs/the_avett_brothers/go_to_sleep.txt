Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man

Twenty-one days lost at sea I fought
For twenty-two years non-stop I've talked
Through the desert, pissed drunk, and confused I walked
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand

Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man

Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me
They sing my funeral song in harmony
I just want to walk home unaccompanied
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me...
La, La, La, La, La, La (I hear them singing)
La, La, La, La, La, La (Singing for me)
La, La, La, La, La, La (Oh!)

Well I wish things were different, true, and deep
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me
You know they told me I could just take my money and leave
I hope the people on the ground will understand
I hope the people in the crowd will understand

Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, La
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, La
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
