Baby, I asked you not to keep me waiting.
I told you now to keep me waiting.
Now the afternoon is fading on.

Donna, Bella Donna have you seen me?
Have you ever really seen me
Like I want for you to see me now?

Lonesome like you were when you were sixteen.
When maybe even I weren't listening.
Did I help when I was kissing you?

Donna, Bella Donna are you listening?
And were you ever really listening
Like I want for you to listen now?
