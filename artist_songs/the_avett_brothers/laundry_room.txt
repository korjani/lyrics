Don't push me out,
Just a little longer
Stall your mother,
Disregard your father's words.

Close the laundry door,
Tiptoe across the floor
Keep your clothes on,
I got all that I can take
Teach me how to use
The love that people say you made

Stop your parents' car
I just saw a shooting star
We can wish upon it
But we wont share the wish we made
But I cant keep no secrets,
I wish that you would always stay

Last night I dreamt the whole night long
I woke with a head full of songs
I spent the whole day
I wrote 'em down, but its a shame
Tonight I'll burn the lyrics,
'Cause every chorus was your name

Break this tired old routine
And this time don't make me leave

I am a breathing time machine,
I'll take you all for a ride
