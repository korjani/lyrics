The sweetest surrender of winter
She put up a flag it is waving
The thunder of summer is rumbling in.

And I haven't seen you in days.
And my how that feeling has changed.
Oh I have been homesick for you since we met.
I have been homesick for you.

I've got to take to the sky. 
And I'll tell you what that means for you and I,
If I die it's for you.
If I die it's for you.

I never lived til I lived in your light
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight 
Of you baby blue, God blessed your life. 
I do not live 'less I live in your life. 
I do not live 'less I live in your life.

The realest thing I ever felt
Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell.
I was a child before 
The day that I met Eleanor.

Kiss of the wind in the hills,
The clearness, the morning, the late evening thrill
Blurry and grey like the roar
The wheels on the highway above them I soar.

When I'm in my sweet daughter's eyes
My heart is now ruined for the rest of all times
There's no part of it left to give.
There's no part of it left to give.

I never lived til I lived in your light
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight 
Of you baby blue, God blessed your life. 
I do not live 'less I live in your life. 
I do not live 'less I live in your life.
I do not live
