I open my door and here's what occurs.
A pretty little gal with pretty little curls.
Leans to the side, leans on my mind.

I don't want to live, but I sure don't want to die.
I'm stuttering again and tellin' her goodbye.
Oh m-m-my, Goodb-b-bye

Will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.

She walks up to me with something more to say.
Then hello and goodbye I hope that you're okay.
Well I'm doing fine I'm doing fine.

Will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.

I wish you'd see yourself as beautiful as I see you
Why can't you see yourself as beautiful as I see you?

I open my door and this is what I see.
The hope inside a girl just looking back at me.
Ohh my Goodbye

Will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.
And will you come again? It's hard to say.
I surely hope so.
