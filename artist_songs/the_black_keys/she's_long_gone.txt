She was made to blow you away
She don't care what any man say
You can watch her strut
But keep your mouth shut
Or it's ruination day

Well now, she's long, long gone
Oh now she's long
Yeah now she's long gone like
Moses through the corn

Her eyes are rubies and pearls
And she's not made like those other girls
Her lashes flap and they smack men back
Like springs they bounce off of her curls

Oh now, she's long, long gone
Na na, na na, na
She's long, long gone
Like Moses through the corn
