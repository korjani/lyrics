You're different
I like it
You're from another planet, huh?
I'd like you to take me there
You can fly your alien spaceship

You're different
Don't hide it
That's what made me notice you

There you were
Sitting by yourself
There you were
Hey, hey, hey

You are a white light
Stepping out of the dark
You are a white light
But you cover it up

Do you wanna fly me miles away
And be alone, alone?
Cuz I don't mind if we never go
Never go home
Stepping out of the dark

We're shoulder to shoulder
Leaving for your universe
And I can't control you
(No I don't no I don't)
Yeah, I can't control you

And there you are
So self-contained
There you are there

You are a white light
Stepping out of the dark
You are a white light
But you cover it up

Do you wanna fly me miles away
And be alone, alone?
Cuz I don't mind if we never go
Never go home
Stepping out of the dark

You are a white light
Stepping out of the dark
You are a white light
But you cover it up

Do you wanna fly me miles away
And be alone, alone?
Cuz I don't mind if we never go
Never go home
Stepping out of the dark
Cuz I don't mind if we never go
Don't mind if we never go
Never go home
