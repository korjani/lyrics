Drinking whisky from a plastic cup
As if it’s gonna make you
Make your mind up

Indecision by your own admission
What you gonna do?

Don’t go looking at me as if I know
Can’t work out what you mean
I’ve got emotions of my own
A tidal wave of feelings to ride

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
We can’t make this work
It may be over but there’s something you should know
You’ve got my love, boy
You’ve got my love
You’ve got my love, boy
You’ve got my love

You could travel until you find yourself
Spend your money on expensive hotels

Indecision by your own admission
What you gonna do?

[Chorus]

You've got my love

[Chorus]
