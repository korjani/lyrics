I will write you letters that
Explain the way I'm thinking now
I, I will return to you
What I have taken long before
I, I will return again
When it gets dark and day is done

And lay me down
In the hollowed ground
Down by your side I will stay
So lay me down

And if you wanna stay with me
Then let me know before it's light
I, I will recoil myself
Into the black and darkest night

And lay me down
In the hollowed ground
Where my father waits I will stay
So lay me down

And lay me down
In the hollowed ground
Down by your side I will stay
So lay me down
