Well I never want to land
'Cause I'm high on you
Beyond all sleight of hand

And tell me if you're sure
And I won't pretend to fall down anymore
'Cause you're all I really want

Headlong, I'm falling in headlong

And act a little braver
And the lies that try to trip you
Will be my slaves

And tell me if you're sure
And the precious, precious waiting I've endured
'Cause you're all I'll ever want

Headlong, I'm falling in headlong
Headlong, I'm falling in headlong
