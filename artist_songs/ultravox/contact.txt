What's wrong, who's right?
Sad machines won't talk to me tonight
No questions looking for answers
No voices except inside my mind

Talk to me, somebody
Talk to me, talk to me
Just looking for contact, my friend

React, rewind
Relive this conversation one last time
Just me in this endless forever
Just me and the sound of a heartbeat, distant drum

Talk to me, somebody
Talk to me, talk
Just looking for contact, my friend

What's wrong, who's right?
Sad machines won't talk to me tonight

Just looking for contact, my friend
