And I could never give in
And I could never feel small
And I could let it all go
Now I've found somewhere to fall

Wire and chain you cast upon me still remain
Walk with your words within me
Taking their toll upon me
Hearing them still
Running around inside until
Time and again they remind me
No matter how distant you'll never be free

And I could never give in
And I could never feel small
And I could let it all go
Now I've found somewhere to fall

Look at me now
What can you hear
Fierce conversations gone on for years
Fighting back words with words of war
Leaving you speechless but crying for more
Talk to me now and try to explain
To someone who won't jump at shadows again
Finding my feet and I'm standing
Fighting a fight that I can win

And I could never give in
And I could never feel small
And I could let it all go
Now I've found somewhere to fall
And I could never give in
And I could never feel small
And I could let it all go
Now I've found somewhere to fall
