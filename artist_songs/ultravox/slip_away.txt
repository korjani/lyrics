Enter me gently, I break in the light
Cover my eyes, with the rags of my life

Was I dreaming 
Or did you say
The frontiers are falling
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away
Let's slip away

All things fall from me, the bonds and the veils
All things blow by me, my sorrows have sails

Was I dreaming 
Or did you say
The empires are fading
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away
Let's slip away

What am I to do
Don't leave me
What is there to say, I really...

We're just wasting time
Let the night takes its place
Colour my eyes with the dusk of this wonderful day

Let's slip away
Let's slip away

Letters from lovers are lining my grate
Some came too early and some came too late

Were you speaking 
Or did I say
The frontiers have fallen
It's time to be slipping away

As you call me
My hands they fall open
My mouth it is frozen
The chrysalis tumbles
I'm falling 
Slow motion 
Dissolve
