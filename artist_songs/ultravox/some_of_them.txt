(Some of them) some of them are changing day to day
(Some of them) some of them flicker then they fade
(Some of them) some of them are triggered off by any crazy thing

(Some of them) some of them are all that's left
(Some of them) some of them are just dead regrets
(Some of them) some of them are shining out through everything I see

Some of them
Some of them
Some of them

(Some of them) some of them are brittle, some are sad
(Some of them) some of them are aching, some are glad
(Some of them) some of them are gone so long they're hard to recognize

Stand close to the long parade
Watch them passing by in their million ways
Walk on through the evergreens
Pass from scene to scene through all these yesterdays

(Some of them) some of them are friends just as they were
(Some of them) some of them are gentle, some can fret
(Some of them) some of them are crowding closer every passing year

(Some of them) some of them live in photographs
(Some of them) some of them still give me a laugh
(Some of them) some of them I've out-absorbed as they're changing me

Some of them
Some of them
Some of them
