It's hard to believe the time has come
For this one
For this one
Good fortune has breathed its breath upon
This one
This one

A handful of wanting, waiting my turn
A mountain of past, a future to burn
A dream of tomorrows, and what will become, become

With hope upon hope and blind desire
Empty horizons fuel my fire
Waiting for something
From life's great liar

It's hard to believe the time has come
For this one
For this one
Good fortune has breathed its breath upon
This one
For this one
It's hard to believe the time has come
For this one

Biding my time 'til my time is due
Waiting in line as a world looks through me
Right through

It's hard to believe the time has come
For this one
For this one
Good fortune has breathed its breath upon
This one
For this one
It's hard to believe the time has come
For this one, for this one
Good fortune has breathed its breath upon
This one
For this one
It's hard to believe the time has come
