Shine from above you, satellite
Follow your lead, follow your light
Libertine blue and angel white
Whoah, free to release my dark tonight

Oh, I defy you
Let your light shine on me tonight
Do, do what you know, know to be right
Wondrous satellite

Feed me with all the hope you find
Lovingly laid, but cruel, unkind
Whisper to me with words so blue
Oh, feed me your drug to see me through

Oh, I defy you
Let your light shine on me tonight
Do, do what you know, know to be right
Wondrous satellite

Oh, I defy you
Let your light shine on me tonight
Do, do what you know, know to be right
Wondrous satellite

Oh, I defy you
Let your light shine on me tonight
Do, do what you know, know to be right
Wondrous satellite

Oh
