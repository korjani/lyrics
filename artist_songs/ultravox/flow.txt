If I could feel some kind of feeling
Send a message to my soul
Tell my mind to lose control
If I could live a life with some meaning
One that love could not deny
From a shattered soul like me

Sometimes I'll try
And sometimes I'll fall
And sometimes I'll let it flow
Let it flow

If I had a thought so hauntingly beautiful
To send a message through the sky
To fight your hate and lies
If I could grow one seed of belief in me
Something to permeate my mind
Like a virus through my system

Then I'll find
That sometimes I'd lose
And sometimes I'd let it flow
Let it flow

If I could grow one seed of belief in me
Something to permeate my mind
Like a virus through my system

Then I'll find
That sometimes I'd lose
And sometimes I'd let it flow
Let it flow

Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
