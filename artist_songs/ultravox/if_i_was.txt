If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was a wiser man
Would other men reach out and touch me?
If I was a kinder man
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease her?
I want to please her again

If I was a painter
I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her
If I was a leader
On food of love from above I would feed her

If I was a poet
All my love and burning words I would show it
If I was her lover
Her eyes in kisses I would cover

Come here my baby
Oh, they can't touch you now
I'll keep you save and warm
I'll never leave you at all

Come here my baby
Oh they won't touch you
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease you
I want to please you again

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was a painter
I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her
If I was a leader
On food of love from above I would feed her

If I was a poet
All my love and burning words I would show it
If I was her lover
Her eyes in kisses I would cover
