Moments like this
I wish that you were mine
And I find that all the tears that you have cried were mine

How I long to hear you laughing now
And to feel the sun come breaking through the clouds

[Chorus:]
From each side of the world
We're calling
Watching the walls come falling down
And you know
Together we go on learning
Perfecting the art of common ground

I feel you within
Majestic and dignified
Dry your eyes as we go through the ritual of time

This is more than just survival now
Together we are guided through somehow

[Chorus]

How I long to hear you laughing now
And to feel the sun come breaking through the clouds

[Chorus]
