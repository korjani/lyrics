Maximise your potential
Utilise the influential
Come take my hand
I'll make you a true believer
Fantasize you're in heaven
Realise your religion
Fall into line
Pay for your redemption

[Chorus:]
Got to be a true believer
Burning up inside with fever
One with God
You've got to pay for your devotion
Feel a little true emotion
One with God

Moralise your obsession
Authorise your donation
It could be so divine
Give your life direction
Try to buy your salvation
Sanctify the TV nation
Be a part of it all
Join the corporation

[Chorus]
