My sex
Waits for me 
Like a mongrel waits 
Downwind on a tight rope leash

My sex
Is a fragile acrobat
Sometimes I'm a novocaine shot
Sometimes I'm an Automat

My sex 
Is often solo
Sometimes it short circuits then
Sometimes it's a golden glow

My sex 
Is invested in 
Suburban photographs
Skyscraper shadows on a car crash overpass

My sex 
Is savage, tender
It wears no future faces
Owns just random gender

My sex 
Has a wanting wardrobe
I still explore 
Of all the bodies I knew 
And those I want to know

My sex 
Is a spark of electro-flesh 
Leased from the tick of time 
And geared for synchromesh

My sex 
Is an image lost in faded films 
A neon outline on a high-rise overspill

My sex
My sex
