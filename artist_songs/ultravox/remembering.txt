Closing my eyes I slip away
I see the pictures play
Of people been and gone
Living in moments from the past
Over much too fast
Still longing to belong

Just remembering
Remembering

Closing my eyes, I walked a while
A never ending mile
In avenues I've crossed
Talking to people stood alone
In streets that I had known
To friends I've loved and lost

Just remembering
Remembering

If I could gather all the moments so precious to stay with me
What would I be, what would I see?

Just remembering
Remembering
Just remembering (if I could gather all the moments so precious to stay with me)
Oo, remembering (if I could gather all the moments so precious to stay with me)
Just remembering (if I could gather all the moments so precious to stay with me)
Oh, remembering (if I could gather all the moments so precious to stay with me)
