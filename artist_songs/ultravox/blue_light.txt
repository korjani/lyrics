I thought I'd take the slide
I thought I'd be alright
But when the details swam
Oh, no, the door got jammed
Someone took the hand
And we were out slow dancing

[Chorus:]
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light
Blue light, blue light

There was a crowd below
Swanning in the glow
All the paste it shimmered
In the swimmer's glimmer
It was a sticky summer
And I was diving under

[Chorus]

Well, nothing drove out behind me
I was so glad
Even the walls were turning round

Well, someone said
There was something wrong
But I couldn't quite
Put my finger on it

What the
Well, I thought I heard
And I tried to
Then we were just diving

[Chorus]
