It's warm tonight, it rained tonight
The windows are all open wide
Can't see the clock to check the time
Nothing is moving
When you walk through me

I turn around to switch the scene
The room dives like a submarine
I cross the carpet trying to leave
Sometimes I can do it
When you walk through me

[Chorus:]
When you walk through me
I almost lose me
It's so confusing
When you walk through me
When you walk through me

Locations change, the angles change
Even the streets get rearranged
While I'm swimming out
Someone waves across a crowded room
I take the train, or shine a shoe
A dark horizon comes to view
I get lost in the crossword clues
Or check the time again

[Chorus]

It's warm tonight, it rained tonight
The windows are all open wide
Can't see the clock to check the time
Nothing is moving
When you walk through me

[Chorus]
