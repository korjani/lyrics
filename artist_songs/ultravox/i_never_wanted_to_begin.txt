Shadows cut across as stolen promises were broke
We wound our watch to stretch the time
In case that no-one got the joke
I never wanted to begin
Name that sin
Name that sin

Dim and distant kisses chill before I catch my death
Etch every name upon the door
And note the ones who never rest
We never knew who'd be within
Name that sin
Name that sin

Shattered captains climbing gates to hold new lamps of fame
For mad kings rowing over lakes
Connecting rooms in black sedans
They never wanted to begin
Name that sin
Name that sin

Evidence is stripped and torn and hidden in the minds
The negatives have all been fogged and blurred
Reduced a thousand times
We never wanted to fall in
Name that sin
Name that sin
