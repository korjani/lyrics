Blast off, the walls are down
Cast off, the wolves are out
Come on, there's no time, I can't wait
Rip off my clothes, I'm stripping yours
Harder we're starved, wired and barbed
What a magnificent disgrace

C'mon and tangle in the dark, dark
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
When it's wet and hot you want to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrokrockwrok

Penetration boys in hotel lifts
Invitations on sinking ships
The whole wide world fits hip to hip
In aircraft destroyers and cinema foyers
The chaste and the chasers, amazing the neighbours
Gay, wild and willing, stripped of grace

A sombre rumba in the dark, dark
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
The population's got to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok

A doodlebugger in the dark, dark
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
When they find the top you've got to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrokrockwrok

A nimble mambo in the park, park
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
The population's got to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrokrockwrok

An anal sailor in the bar, bar
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
When it's wet and hot you want to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok

A plucky sucker in the car park
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
There's nothing left for us, just ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
ROckWrokrockwrok

A willing waltzer in the car, stark
Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
Austerity makes you want to ROckWrok
ROckWrok, ROckWrok
