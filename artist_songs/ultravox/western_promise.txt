Hai

Oh, mystical East, on old postcards
Your childhood dreams and energies
Your temples' gardens, old world charm
An ancient culture, torn and scarred

This is my western promise

Oh, mystical East, you've lost your way
Your rising sun shall rise again
My western world gives out her hand
A victor's help to your fallen land

This is my western promise

Hai

Mystical East, all taxi-cabs
All ultra-neon, sign of the times
Your Buddha Zen and Christian man
All minions to messiah Pepsi can

This is my western promise
