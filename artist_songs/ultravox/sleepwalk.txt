(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Rolling and falling, I'm choking and calling
Name after name after name

(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Naked and bleeding, the streetlights stray by me
Hurting my eyes with their glare

(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces
Destined, we had to collide

(Sleepwalk)

Caught on the outside, I'm crumpling and crawling
Watching the day drag away
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers
Grip 'round my throat as I dream (dream, dream, dream dream)
