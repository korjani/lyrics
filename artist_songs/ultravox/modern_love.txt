Modern lovers, we
Shine suspended while
Tricking time and turning tides, oh-oh
Modern beauties they
Broadcast endlessly
Frozen flowers for the brides
Of modern love
That's modern love
That's modern love

All I need is a chemical vacation
I'll take a video stroll through the life exchange
Changing, fading, all of my molecules surrender
Reassemble me baby and maybe I'll look just like you, oh-oh

Modern lovers, we're
Vampire gangsters with
Miles of smiles and reams of dreams, oh-oh
Modern romance
Explains all angles, flicks
Ash of roses from my sleeve
On modern love
Modern love

Modern living makes
Molten maidens and
Men of action matching moods, oh-oh
Modern lovers
Exchange their faces, we're
Hanging portraits on the moon
Of modern love
That's modern love
That's modern love
That's modern love!
