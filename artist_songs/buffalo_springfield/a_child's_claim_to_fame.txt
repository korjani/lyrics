Well there goes another day
Now I wonder why
You and I
Keep telling lies
I can't believe that what you say
'cause tomorrows lullaby
can't passify
my lonesome crying
Make believe that's all you know
And to make believe is a game
A child's rein
You've changed your name
So sadly I watched the show
I watched you became
Truth is the shame
Yeah, too much pain
