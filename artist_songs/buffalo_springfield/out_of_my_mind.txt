Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for
All I hear are screams from outside the limousines
That are taking me

Out of my mind
Through the keyhole in an open door
Happy to find
That I don't know what I'm smiling for
Tired of hanging on
If you've missed me, I've just gone
Cause they're taking me
Out of my mind
