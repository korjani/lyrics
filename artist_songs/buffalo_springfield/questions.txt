Where are we going love?
What are you feelin'?
Now that I've caught my love
My head is reelin',

With the questions of a thousand dreams,
What you do and what you see.
Come on lover, talk to me.

When I was on my own
Chasin' you down,
What was it made you run.
Tryin' to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams,
What you do and what you see.
Come on lover, talk to me.

Now that we've found each other
Where do we go now?
I'd like to know what you're thinkin'.
Answer me slowly now

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see.
Come on lover, talk to me, yeah.
