Soft winds blow in the summertime
Young lovers feel so free
Walking hand in hand down a shady lake
What happened to me?
What happened to me?

Did you ever love a girl who
Walked right out on you
You should know just how I'm feeling
Why I'm so blue
Why I'm so blue

How can I forget those nights
When she'd kiss me soft and true
And whisper words only lovers know
I Love You
I Love You

We'll I've made up my mind
I'll find a new girl
Who'll love me tenderly
Forget the past
I left behind now
to sad memories
