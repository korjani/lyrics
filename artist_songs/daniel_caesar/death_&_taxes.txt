Surely my sins have found me out
God rest my soul, but show me out
Surely my sins have found me out
Spit on my grave, but kiss my mouth

Surely we'll live to see the day
When all of our problems, they fade away

I see your heart break and I feel your pain
It's funny how heaven and hell are the same
Come walk with me, I don't play those games
I live in the real world, I've lost my faith

Surely we'll live to see the day
When all of our problems, they fade away

Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure

Surely my sins have found me out
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I’m sure
Death and taxes
Death and taxes
