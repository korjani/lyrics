[Daniel Caesar:]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Kali Uchis:]
And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, It’s all just memories

[Daniel Caesar:]
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take...

[Daniel Caesar:]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Kali Uchis:]
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise
