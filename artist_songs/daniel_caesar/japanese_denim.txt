I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that
But I wait for you
I don't like to drink, I don't like to think, fuck that
But I ponder you
I'm bending it over
You're my four leaf clover
I'm so in love, so in love
There's no one above up above
Forever's a long time, yes

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
So should we
I'm spending all this time

Met you at the shop, sun was getting hot, I'm lonely
I'm in the city on my own
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie
But that's the way it goes
I'm reaching Nirvana
Goodbye sweet Rwanda
High school was never for me
I say let it be, let it be
Forever's a long time

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
So should we
I'm spending all this time

You don't even know me
You don't even know me
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the tree
