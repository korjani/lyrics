Baby put a bullet in me
Lord knows I'm no good
I'm a man with good intentions
Just misunderstood
Every morning when you wake up
Turn over to my side
Tell me just what do you see when you look into my eyes

Don't give up on me now
I'll still get better
Don't throw in the towel
Don't give up on me yet
I'm still growing into your man
Yes I am

I need you to stay with me
Save me from this deep despair
Without you I cannot breathe
Where am I if you're not there?

Won't live here without you
I can't go through the pain
Won't live here without you
Can't go through that again

I know there ain't two ways about it
You know that you should never doubt it
People make mistakes

Ascend with me up into heaven
And leave behind this Armageddon
I'll take you to a better place

Yes I know sometimes I hurt you
Sometimes you hurt me too
Makes me go mad
Every time you hear this music
Take that pain and use it
Use it for you

Yes I know sometimes I hurt you
Sometimes you hurt me too
Make me go mad
Every time you hear this music
Take that pain and use it
Use it for you
