I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in

I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm turning, turning, turning
Might as well turn in

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in
