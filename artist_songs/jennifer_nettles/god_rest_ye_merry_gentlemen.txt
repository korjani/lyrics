God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid Him in a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name

O tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we we have gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
