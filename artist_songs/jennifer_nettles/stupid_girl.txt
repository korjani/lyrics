Stupid girl
How could you think
That you could take those wings
And fly so close to the sun
Do you like to fall for fun

Oh, stupid girl
How dare you to try
To bring your dark to the light
Live your life undivided
Take your unhappy and hide it

You got to hold yourself back
Put yourself last, never first
Always make 'em laugh
Say you're sorry
Never make it worse
Take a deep breath
Give 'em what
They want and smile

All my life
I've tried to do what's right
But I'm a leaver
Who can't leave well enough alone
I'm a seeker, an unholy rolling stone
And I might be stupid
But that stupid girl ain't wrong

Stupid girl
What else could you want
How could you ask for something more
With all the gifts you were given
Ain't it enough to just be living

You got to hold yourself back
Put yourself last, never first
Always make 'em laugh
Say you're sorry
Never make it worse
Take a deep breath
Give 'em what
They want and smile

Oh, all my life
I've tried to do what's right
But I'm a leaver
Who can't leave well enough alone
I'm a seeker, an unholy rolling stone
And I might be stupid
But that stupid girl ain't wrong

There are no answers without questions
Even if they're wrong
How else you gonna love all the lessons
We only get this one trip
Lose the fear, lose the grip
And throw the lines from the ship
And take it all my life

Oh, all my life
I've tried to do what's right
But I'm a leaver
Who can't leave well enough alone
I'm a seeker, an unholy rolling stone
And I might be stupid
But that stupid girl ain't wrong

I'm not wrong
