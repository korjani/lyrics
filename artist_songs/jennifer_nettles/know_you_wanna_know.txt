Saw them holding hands, knew he was a married man,
Did she forget the ring on her own finger?
His wife has a baby on the way, friends all said he had it made,
Gave it all up for a huzzy country singer.
It's on every dot com, so it must be true.
The internet wouldn't lie to you.
So sit back and watch the winners lose

Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)

Smile sweet from a magazine, perfect fit in skinny jeans,
Knows damn well the message that she's sending.
I heard her secret to a nice size four,
Is what goes on behind the bathroom door
But she don't care long as Twitter says she's trending.
But the smile's not quite so bright,
In the picture that came with the DUI.
Watchin' them fall can really get you high.

Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
(Know you wanna know)
(Know you wanna know)

When things get tough in Tinsel Town,
There's no career that's so far down,
That a little sex tape wouldn't turn around.

Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
