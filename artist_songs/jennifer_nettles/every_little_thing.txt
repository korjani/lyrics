Baby, I've been waiting, waiting so long for you
Lately, don't even know myself, who I've been turning to
One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed.
Never knew that I could love somebody, out of my head this way.

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of. 
You've got me wrapped around your finger. 
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to. 
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep. 
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do.

You smile, that smile so sweet and I'm completely gone. 
I surrender, woah oh, you play me just like a song. 
One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed.
Never knew that I could love somebody out of my head this way.

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of. 
You've got me wrapped around your finger. 
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to. 
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep. 
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do.

I don't need money, I don't need anything
I got all I ever needed everytime you say my name
Baby I just can't believe that you're mine

One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed.
Never knew that I could love somebody out of my head this way.

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of. 
You've got me wrapped around your finger. 
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to. 
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep. 
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do.
I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do.
I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do.
