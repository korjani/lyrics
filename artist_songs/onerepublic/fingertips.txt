Trying to keep ourselves alone and out of sight

And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

And I remember you, you were first on my list
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
I remember us, we were a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slips
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
