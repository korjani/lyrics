I don't know how I let her go
I thought the chain would always be unbroken
Now my heart keeps tellin' me
Words I should have said or left unspoken

So after you are through
Doin what you're gonna do
After you blow her heart away
I will still be here to say

Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who loves her
Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who needs her
Send her to me, send her to me

I can't blame her for a thing
I guess you really made her feel so wanted
When she sees she was a fool
Her empty heart will feel me haunting

So after you are through
Making her go through all the moves
After you chase her dreams away 
I will still be here to say

Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who loves her
Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who needs her
Send her to me, send her to me

I will never turn away
After the tears have burned away
And when the smoke is finally clear
I will still be here to say

Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who loves her
Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who needs her
Send her to me, send her to me
I'm the one who loves her
Send her to me, send her to me
Oh, I'm the one
