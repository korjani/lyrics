Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop

She starts to feel
The heat turning up
Inner tension pulling strong
The key into her womanhood
Is a man to make her feel good

She feels the night invited her
She feels the love inside of her
She hears the music in her head
And she dreams of passion
In her bed

Because she's a
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl won't quit
Until she drops
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl won't quit
Until she drops

She'll catch your eye
With every glance
She's hot to trot at any chance
She's a fireball
In skin tight jeans
To advertise her ways and means

She feels the night invited her
She feels the love inside of her
She hears the music in her head
And she dreams of passion
In her bed

Because she's a
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl won't quit
Until she drops
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl, that girl, that girl
Won't stop

She party's to the break of day
Then goes to work to earn her pay
Fast asleep from 5 to 10
Then she starts it all again

Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl won't quit
Until she drops
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
Night teen and non-stop
That girl won't quit
Until she drops

Night teen and non-stop
(Night teen)
Night teen and non-stop
(Night teen)
Night teen and non-stop
That girl, that girl won't stop
Night teen and non-stop
(Night teen)
Night teen and non-stop
(Night teen)
Night teen and non-stop
That girl, that girl, that girl
Can't stop
