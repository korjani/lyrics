Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock, put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie was doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact

Up all night and sleep all day
I got to tell you, that's how we play
Booze and ladies, treat me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

We're an American band, yeah
We're an American band, wooh
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band, alright

Oh, young chiquitas in Baltimore
We're waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective, he was outta sight

But these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on dudes, let's get it on!"
And we proceeded to rock that hotel down

We're an American band, yeah
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band, that's right

We're an American band, yeah yeah
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band, yeah yeah yeah yeah

We're an American band, yeah
We're an American band, wooh
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band (we're an American band)
We're an American band (we're an American band)
We're comin' to your town
