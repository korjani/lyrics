He was lost in a kerosene dream
Fuelled by the urge inside
Always been told not to play with fire
Never was one to abide

It all started way back when
When the neighbor's house burnt down
Hypnotized by the burning flame
And in that flame his love was found

Now time went on like it always does
No one knew about his love affair
Love it was it's a twisted game
Now he's gone with out a prayer

Today he learnt his lesson well
Today he burnt like you do in hell

I wish this tale could end another way
In twisted games we should never play

Now I'll tell you another tale
About a boy who loved his gun
His 45 was his one best friend
Twisted games that can't be won

Another day or so they thought
No one knew what was to come
This little town will never be the same
With a little boy who loved his gun

Today he learnt his lesson well
Today he burnt his one last shell

I wish this tale could end another way
Twisted games we should never play
