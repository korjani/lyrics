Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Madness is fragile and fragile is she
In chaos she's agile and madness is me
We knew from the beginning it wasn't alright
Like being in a padded room for more than one night
Judgment escaped me I speak for us both
Like the bond that we made let's call it an oath

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Filled with the confidence of nothing to loose
Armed with an axe and a whole lot of booze
Plans were made down to each detail
With a plan like that how could we fail
We packed all our gear in the trunck of my brother's car
'Cause time is running out says the clock on the wall
Judgment escaped me I speak for us both
Like the bond that we made we call it an oath

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Madness is fragile and fragile is she
In chaos she's agile and madness is me
She had the key to keeping me insane
But now I'm gone and she's got to be tamed
As I am telling you as it is true
I'm on my way to bury you
Gonna put you down under
Gotta put you down under 

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die

Together we will live
Together we'll die
