I can still see the change
In the falling rain
How come we can't do the same
How come

I see the angry scar
But the wound is tame
How come we can't do the same
How come

I hear the church bells laugh
It's a wedding day
How come we don't feel that way
How come

When the clouds step aside
(I don't want to be you)
The sun lets them live
(you don't want to be me)
How come we can't forgive
(neither one should be)
How come

When the clouds step aside
(I don't want to be here)
The sun lets them live
(you don't want to be here)
How come we can't forgive
(there is nobody here)
How come
(there is nobody here)
How come
