[CHORUS:]
Conversation with the child who once believed in you
How does one explain to him what it is you do
He says Daddy Daddy please tell me it's not true
What all the people are saying....saying about you

There comes a time when one must face the life that you have led
That is a hard thing to do when lies is all that has been said
And the blameless eyes of an innocent youth
Is begging for you to tell the truth
It's such a hard way to learn....hard way to learn

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right
Come now little boy don't you cry
'Cause the child in you is still alive

[CHORUS]

There comes a time in this child's life when the boy becomes a man
So many things from his past he now can understand
Like all the times when Dad would leave and be gone for so long
And he thought everything was all right
And he thought everything was all right

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right
Come now little boy don't you cry
'Cause the child in you is still alive

This moment of truth will hurt for life
Don't need to tell you that ain't right
Come now little boy don't you cry
'Cause the child in you is still alive

Such a hard way to learn......[REPEAT]
