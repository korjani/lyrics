Girl I can't abide
By the rules you laid down in this game
'cause now I've gone and lost myself in you
One time you catch a ride
And it takes you miles away
There's a chance of never feeling blue

And those lonely days will be long time forgotten
If we could find another way
Now let's contemplate is this time of passion
Strong enough to make you stay
Because I do believe in forever
And forever I will stay
And those lonely days will remain
Miles and miles away

Emotional exile
Is the safest way to play
Gotta take a chance every now and then
Irresistible change of heart
I will guide your way
We could share a life again

And those lonely days will be long time forgotten
If we could find another way
Now let's contemplate is this time of passion
Strong enough to make you stay
Because I do believe in forever
And forever I will stay
And those lonely days will remain

Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away

Miles and miles away....
[repeat]
