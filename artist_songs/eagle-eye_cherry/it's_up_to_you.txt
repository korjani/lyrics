Downtown is where it all went down
Getting up with nothing to do
Don't know what street I lived on
And I'm not sure I ever knew
Well it goes on I've got more to tell
Can't promise you that it's all true

It's up to you to figure out
Which part is true

Now anxiety has arrested me
And it's hard to tell what gets me through
But I do recall many things I've seen
And worst of all I think it's true

It's up to you to figure out
Which part is true

Wish I would have stayed in bed that day
And this memory would be there to
Now I can't make it go away
And that's why it must be true

It's up to you to figure out
Which part is true
