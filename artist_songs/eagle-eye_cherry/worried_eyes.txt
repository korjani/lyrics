I've tried so hard to remember what it is that I forgot
But I can, but I can believe.....will you now
I've tried, I've tried
I've tried
Cried and kissed goodbye
To something that we both know
Boy you blow my mind
I don't know how I'm going to
Show you what I feel for you
All I know
All I know is I...
Want to be with you

Have you ever tried to be
Have you ever tried to see
Something but you don't really know what it is
Lord but we got to try

[CHORUS:]
I look at you
I hear your voice
I try to remember.....I try to remember
So don't you look at me with worried eyes
'Cause you know we got to try girl

All I know
All I know is I....
Want to be with you...
Here I am and I believe
Yes I do.....What I do, What I do for you

[CHORUS]

All I know
All I know is I....
Want to be with you...
