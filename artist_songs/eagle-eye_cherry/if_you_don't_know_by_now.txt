There's that place
A good place to start
There's that end
That's the beginning of it all
Are you that girl
That's going to break my heart
I don't wanna be me
When disappointment makes its call

All I know is that…

If you don't know by now
All my hope it gone

You must know
Know what you want
And if you go
It don't matter who is at fault
Now I see
I'm up against the wall
Don't wanna be me
When disappointment makes its call

All I know is that…

If you don't know by now
All my hope is gone

Oh yea…it's so hard to say
Seems to be this day
Seems to be that way
I don't know what to tell you
I don't know what to tell you
It's so hard to believe that this could be the end

If you don't know by now 
All my hope is gone
If you don't know by now
Where did I go wrong
