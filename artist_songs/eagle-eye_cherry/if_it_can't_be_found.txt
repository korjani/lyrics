Dreams
Had more than a few
Dreams
And some did come true

We just can't get enough

Now we've got all we wanted
Still we're not satisfied at all
If it can't be found
You'll never get it
If it can't be found
If it can't be found

Greed
What can we do
Greed
Can't satisfy you

We just can't get enough

Now we've got all we wanted
Still we're not satisfied at all
If it can't be found
You'll never get it
If it can't be found
If it can't be found
