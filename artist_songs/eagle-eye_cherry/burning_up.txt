Would you believe me
If I said I'd never lie
Though it ain't easy
I can tell you I have tried
But I got to say
That it comes those days
That I told something untrue
Would you forgive me
If I said I'd lied to you

This is my fear
To tell you what I've done
As things come clear
I'm afraid that you'll be gone
But all I know
Is if you go
At least I've told what's true
Hope you'll forgive me
When I say I've lied to you

I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do

How will you kill me
For what I'm about to tell
Please do it gently
'Cause you know I'm bound for hell
All I know is 
I've lost my soul
I'm burning inside
Hope you'll forgive me
Yes I have lied
Oh yes I've lied

I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do

Now you know that I've gone
And I've been untrue to you
And once it's told
Well you know there's nothing we can do
I regret that I let this get so out of hand
I pray, please stay, that you'll understand

I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do

I'm burning up...
