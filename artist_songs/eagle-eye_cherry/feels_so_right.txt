Too shy to
To follow through
But it is true
Yes, I do love you
You say no
But I won't go
'Cause all I know
Is you and I are meant to be
You and I are meant to be

Too proud to
Give in to
All the love
That I wanna lay on you
So called no
Say it ain't so
'Cause all I know
Is that you and I are meant to be
You and I are meant to be

Feels so right
Feels so right
It feels so right

Too lost to
Realize who
Well here's one clue
I'm standing right in front of you
Don't say no
'Cause I can't go
Well all I know
Is that you and I are meant to be
You and I are meant to be

Feels so right
Feels so right
It feels so right

Too shy
Too proud
To speak
Too loud
Too high
Too low
Too weak
To know
Too much
To give
To want
To live
Too much
To give
To want
To feel
Alright

You say no
I still won't go
'Cause all I know is that
You and I are meant to be
You and I are meant to be

Feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right

Too shy
Too proud
To speak
Too loud
Too high
Too low
Too weak
To know
Too much
To give
To want
To live
Too much
To give
To want
To feel
Alright

Feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
