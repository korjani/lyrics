Recipes are just combinations
And what are these just mere salutations
When they plead for our salvation
Are these just the lies that feed our nations 

As enemies we never learn
A shaking hand is never firm
But as the path clears we turn away from it all

All these jealousies we have earned 
Oh so shamelessly they still return 
All the outlandish lessons we have burned 
Yes and we're imprisoned by the whole thing

Who gets something really good to eat
Why do we want the world to fall at our feet
Like a child throws its food to the floor
Like an apple that is rotten to the core

As all the memories they kick in
The gravy, it is thickening
The combination is sickening
But we still press on

And as all the memories they kick
While the gravy it is thickening
And the combination is sickening
But we still press on

How to know what's in your head
How to know if you're just playing dead
But it's all gonna be that way when you say you're alone and imprisoned by your yesterdays

Oh you know what you really want 
But yet you've turned yourself into what you don't really wanna be
Here we are and we know don't have to be that way
yes u know it
