It's an egg hunt for dates
On new roller-skates
While grooms and their brides
Take horse-drawn rides
Unless you've seen it
You cannot believe it
It's so, so bizarre

Boys gone bad
With their absentee dads
Who live with their pets
'Cause they're hedgin' their bets
Unless you're seen it 
You cannot believe it
It's so, so bizarre

How can it be, that it's only me
How can it be, that it's only me

It's a well-known song
And he's singin' it wrong
But the crowd's on the bong
So they all clap along
Unless you've seen it
You cannot believe it
It's so, so bizarre

It's a summertime vibe
And the park is alive
And the actors arrive to be led on their lines
Unless you're seen it 
You cannot believe it
It's so, so bizarre

How can it be, that it's only me
How can it be, that it's only me
That sees the strange
The strange, the strange
