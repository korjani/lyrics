Nothing around but I can feel it
It looms above me, and I still fear it
There's no one here yet I am screaming
Buried alive, wish I was dreaming

No love could fucking save me
No love could fucking save me

It's far away, not far enough
I've seen it all, I've seen too much
I can't forget that crushing feeling
That I'm forever giving up

(Give up!)

Can I keep myself from this need to find a reason
When I'll regret the answer and yet I keep on searching?

There's blood in my mouth and I can't see you, no
If you look back right now will you see me? Yeah
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight, that leaves me reeling
I'll see you there someday, maybe you'll see me

Nothing around but I can feel it
It looms above me, and I still fear it
There's no one here yet I am screaming
Buried alive, wish I was dreaming

No love could fucking save me
No love could fucking save me

There's fire on the bridge
The smoke is choking
The will to live is fading
My train is slowing down

There's blood in my mouth and I can't see you, no
If you look back right now will you see me? Yeah
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight, that leaves me reeling
I'll see you there someday, maybe you'll see me

The tracks they rattle like my teeth
I'll grind them down
My bones break in time
The seeds have been sown
The river has run dry
This is my final goodbye

Can I keep myself from this need to find a reason
When I'll regret the answer and yet I keep on searching?

There's blood in my mouth and I can't see you, no
If you look back right now will you see me? Yeah
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight, that leaves me reeling
I'll see you there someday, maybe you'll see me
