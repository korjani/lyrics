I've been there, I've done that
I'll probably be back
My heart pounds, my chest hurts
It only gets worse
I've been there, I've done that
I'll try not to go back
Death calling, "just collapse"
But I won't, no fuck that

I try to fight it, depression I hide it
My tail between my legs searching for one last breath
I swear I can do this just need to pull through it
Fight my regret, I swear, I swear there's hope left

I've lost myself before
Told myself I want more
Then lost track of that score
These vices are my lords
I've lost myself before
There's got to be more

I've been there, I've done that
I'll probably be back
My heart pounds, my chest hurts
It only gets worse
I've been there, I've done that
I'll try not to go back
Death calling, "just collapse"
But I won't, no fuck that

Fight my regret
I swear, I swear there's hope left
Fight my regret
I swear, I swear there's hope left

More bad days and cold sweats
I feel sick from regret
Here's to love, here's to peace
Solid ground beneath me
I won't stop, won't fall back
I won't stop, no fuck that

I won't stop, won't fall back
I won't stop, no fuck that

I've lost myself before
Told myself that I want more
I've lost myself before
There's got to be more

I've been there, I've done that
I'll probably be back
My heart pounds, my chest hurts
It only gets worse
I've been there, I've done that
I'll try not to go back
Death calling, "just collapse"
But I won't, no fuck that

Fight my regret
I swear, I swear there's hope left
Fight my regret
I swear, I swear there's hope left
