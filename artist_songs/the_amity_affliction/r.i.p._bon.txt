I was waiting for you man, right down there by the sea
Where we used to meet, to share in our pain and decry misery.
I waited, I waited, I waited I swear,
But when I got down to the ocean, man, you were not fucking there,

I just wish that you spoke up and held out your hand
Because you know I was there, man, you know that I cared.

I waited for you but you never came, no, you never came
And now that you're gone I feel I'm to blame, yeah, I feel I'm to blame

I wanted to hear it, I wanted to know.

I've been grieving so much with each passing day,
But I'm angry and hurt and I hate you all the same.

I just wish that you spoke up and held out your hand
Because you know I was there, man, you know that I cared.

I waited for you but you never came, no, you never came
And now that you're gone I feel I'm to blame, yeah, I feel I'm to blame

I know now you hated life even more with each breath,
I know now that you did not have any fight left.

To know you were grieving with each passing day (I know you were grieving with each passing day)
And to know most of all you did not want to stay (and I know most of all you did not want to stay)
And you know you were grieving with each passing day.

I waited for you but you never came, no, you never came
And now that you're gone I feel I'm to blame, yeah, I feel I'm to blame

Did I never listen? did I never show, did I never show?
'Cause I wanted to hear. I wanted to hear it, I wanted to know.
I wanted to know.
