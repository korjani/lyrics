I know you're sinking deeper, every breath a straining gasp
And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last'
But there's life out there for living
My friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in
We'll give you everything worth giving
I heard a story from a friend about you just last night
About you swinging by your neck there in the softly fading light
Man you've gotta call you've gotta write you've gotta leave
Get back to all your friends and all the places you should be
You're too lonesome man, I get it, I've been there once before

I know you're sinking deeper, every breathe a straining gasp
And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last'
But there's life out there for living
My friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in
We'll give you everything worth giving

I've sailed the stormy seas, I've felt my heart rise in my throat
I've thought of leaving all my friends and thought of letting go
But I found life left in these limbs and found the strength to start again
I found my heart right in my hands and found relief in all my friends

Don't Give Up!
Don't Give Up!

But I found life left in these limbs and found the strength to start again
I found my heart right in my hands and found relief in all my friends

But there's life out there for living
My friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in
We'll give you everything

I know you're sinking deeper, every breath a straining gasp
And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last'
But there's life out there for living
My friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in
We'll give you everything worth giving
