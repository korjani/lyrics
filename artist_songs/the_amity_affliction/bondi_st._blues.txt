I spent my time back then thinking of nothing but them,
the dead ends of my thoughts the last friends in my head:
and you heard me you heard me you heard me my friend,
sent the ship over seas to save me from death.
Through the storms I have weathered through the dark and the rain,
you sent me the ship that I sail on today.
And the boat sails on like you sang in your song,
and my mind feels clearer several years on.

And the ship that was sailing on,
those storm ridden seas
was my heart and your words gave my heart back to me.

My mind was a turbine that fueled all the storms,
and those words were the courage in which calmness took form.
Through the storms I have weathered
through the dark and the rain,
you sent me the ship that I sail on today.

And the boat sails on like you sang in your song,
and my mind feels clearer several years on.
And the ship that was sailing on,
those storm ridden seas
was my heart and your words gave my heart back to me.

I've found life, found the strength in myself to grow up
I've found friends, and the strength and the want to live
And the ship that was sailing on,
those storm ridden seas
was my heart and your words gave my heart back to me.
Through the storms I have weathered
through the dark and the rain,

And the boat sails on like you sang in your song,
and my mind feels clearer several years on. [x3]

And the ship that was sailing on,
those storm ridden seas
was my heart and your words gave my heart back to me.
