People saving whales,
And giving your thanks to our seas,
My respect to the ones in the forest,
Standing up for our old trees

Them giving food to the hungry,
Giving hope to the needy,
Giving life to a baby,
Giving care for free,
'Cause there is freedom around us,
We have everything we need,
And I will care for you,
'Cause you care for me.
And we all have opinions,
Some of them get through,
But there's better people,
With more good to do.
Good to do

And what I have could be a message
Or just some words from my heart
My respect to the ones making changes
For other lives they'll give their own

Like giving food to the hungry,
Giving hope to the needy,
Giving life to a baby,
Giving care for free,
'Cause there is freedom around us,
We have everything we need,
And I will care for you,
'Cause you care for me.
And we all have opinions,
Some of them get through,
But there's better people,
With more good to do.
Good to Do

Well our world it keeps spinning round and round it goes
Human nature keeps spreading its disease
And our children keep growing up with what they know
From what we teach and what they see
And it's only a question of the time we have
And the lives that our children will lead
Cause they can only keep growing up with what they know
And what we teach, and what they see

Like giving food to the hungry,
Giving hope to the needy,
Giving life to a baby,
Giving care for free,
'Cause there is freedom around us,
We have everything we need,
And I will care for you,
'Cause you care for me.
We all have opinions,
Some of them get through,
But there's better people,
With more good to do.
