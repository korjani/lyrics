There was all these people hanging out
In the front, asleep, just on the foot path
You know, lying down
Maybe a cardboard box to sleep on
And be lucky to have a blanket
And, and people were stepping over the top
In 2 or 3 degree weather, you know Celsius
2 or 3 degrees was freezing cold 
People just stepping over the top to get in their cars
