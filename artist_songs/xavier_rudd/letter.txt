(I) I sit by my window with everything I've done
Doors that I've opened and webs that I've spun
And the candle besides me burns to the left
And the rain on the clay sends the lizard to it's nest

And there will be a time, that I hold you again
With my arms spread out, just you'll rest
And I'll write you a letter with everything I know
About the weight of the world and the way things could go

So live up my friend, step back again
For some things will be given, for some you'll have to bend
You'll have to bend my friend, to hold on to this
For some things will come easy, and some will be a test
You'll have to bend.

Now the ocean connects me to everything I know
By mellowing my mind soon my heart, it can call
With these trees as my witness I'll slice up some fruit
And each to their peaceful good intentions and truths
There will be a time, when I will hold you again
with my arms spread out, I would dive right in... soon I'll

Here is your letter, with everything I know
About the weight of the world and the way things could go

So give up my friend, step back again
For some things will be given, for some you'll have to bend
you'll have to bend my friend, to hold on to this
For some things will come easy, and some will be a test
You'll have to bend.

Now the ocean connects me to everything I know
By mellowing my mind soon my heart, it can call
With these trees as my witness I'll slice up some fruit
And each to their peaceful good intentions and truths
There will be a time, when I will hold you again
with my arms spread out, I will dive right in

So now here's your letter, with everything I know
about the weight of the world and the way things could go
