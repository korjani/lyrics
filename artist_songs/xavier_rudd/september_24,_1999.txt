A relaxed state of worry.
Predicted fate seems constructed.
And by the car tremors were lightly shaded
While the radiator's overheating.

So then when I remove the cap,
Do I speak, where do I stand?
For now our judge my fear just serve as tension
For hers is so far from home.

Germinating seed from the positive
Germinating deep inside my heart.
And it will gnaw through the negatives
As it grows on

Cause I won't fall away from this.
Nothing you say will make me twist.
I won't fall away from this.
Nothing you say will make me twist.

Black clouds seem thick
When they cover all your stars.
There'll be days when you will sit.
You'll let them swallow your spark.
But the fear is in the wind
Without choice in the dark.

And then again there's ice cream
And so much hype, and so much talk.
With human beings comes so much hate and violence
But you can always seek love and support.

And I keep hoping, frustrated,
For my gift to be served.
And my foolish insecurity
Ignores the guidance from those clear and in touch.

Look there's belief from the feeders
And true belief from some who love.
And now it's growing inside the one sent to me
By her heart.

Cause I won't fall away from this.
Nothing you say will make me twist.
And I won't fall away from this.
Nothing you say will make me twist.

So I'll take the test presented
And I will force it back inside its home.
Cause my heart will win
Always
