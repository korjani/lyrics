And I went down to Spanish Town
To look for a friend of mine
Who's called seminar yard
And we started to have a little talk
About everything
About the situation
And this is what he said:
He told me famine,famine,famine
Famine on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high
Fees are so high, high, high
Sky high
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high

So I went down to Old Harbour
To look for my brother John
To ask him how is life
And things and things and things
And we started to have a little talk
About everything
About the situation
And this is what he said:
He told me famine,famine,famine
Famine on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high
Fees are so high, high, high
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high

So I went down to Clarendon
To look for my family
To a little strett called Train Lane
Is where I was born
And we started to have a little talk
Together together
About the situation
And this is what they said:
They told me famine,famine,famine
Famine on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high
Fees are so high, high, high
Sky high
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high
