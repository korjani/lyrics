This dimension and the next
The living and the dead
The wave into the corpse
Everybody cares
Everybody cares
I'm sure love exists
And this is what it is

I'm polluted by my blood
So help me cut it out
And rinse it down the drain
Everybody cares
Everybody cares
They say love exists
Then what happened to it?

Everybody's wanting to see
Wanting to see it come alive
Pour the ashes into the cup
Mix with wine
Here's to sleep, drink up

Everybody's wanting to see
Wanting to see it come alive
Pour the ashes into the cup
Mix with wine
Here's to sleep, drink up

Everybody's wanting to see
Wanting to see it come alive
Pour the ashes into the cup
Mix with wine
Here's to death, drink up
