Explosions pillaging the night
From the fireworks on the fourth of July
It's just my lady, our friends, and I
Smoking cigars and yelling at cars as they drive by

We scaled a ladder ascending to the roof
While five years ago I leaped and no one knew
Holding my guitar, I strummed a tune
I sang "I love you, but I have to cut you loose"

As the neighbor lights off the small bombs we watch
From the rooftop safely, so safely

If I had never let go, then only God knows where I would be now
I made a bridge between us then I slowly burned it
Five years ago, in my backyard, I sang love away
Little did I know that real love had not quite yet found me
