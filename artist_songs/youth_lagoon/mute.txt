Living in a 3-D world,
Where the clock is in control.
He sits on his throne on top of my wrist and tells me what I know.

The devil tries to plague my mind,
But he can't quite get inside.
I'll place my jar in a burial grounds that only I can find.

Winding up the back road hill,
Looking for God's acre still.
And just when I gave up, a headstone was seen near the top of the military kill.

As I hear the horses drawing close,
Over all the corpses we loved most.
But I never see them, I never see them.
I never see them, I never see them.

There's a figure watching from the knoll.
All the myths and stories we were told,
But I never listen, I never listen.
I never listen, I never listen.
