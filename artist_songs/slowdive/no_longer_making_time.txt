You come anyway
You say "I'm clean" and you like it that way
You come when you're bored
You keep saying "Liar, you like a liar, liar"
Who cares anyway
Oh Lord, I remember those days
And all those nights
When you wanted so much more

Kathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we be together, we breathe
No longer for too long

You come anyway
Come on down through the highway
It comes and goes
You come around but don't run away
Just lovers of life
Come around and there's no surprise
Just hold your arms
Hold them up until the feeling grows

Kathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we be together, we breathe
No longer for too long
Kathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we be together, we breathe
No longer for too long

Who cares anyway
Oh Lord, I remember those days
And all those nights
Hold them up until the feeling grows
