The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone
And me I am her dagger
Too numb to feel her pain

The world is full of noise, yeah
I hear it all the time
And me I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper:
"It happens all the time"
I thought I heard you whisper:
"It happens all the time"

She whispers while I'm sleeping
I love you when you smile
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

The world is full of noise, yeah
I hear it all the time
You know I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper:
"It happens all the time"
I thought I heard you whisper
"It happens all the time"
