Watch the waves so far away
They're washing 'cross the paths that I have made

Leaving all my sins, I turn away
Like soaring birds, I watch my sorrows play

Don't you know I've left and gone away?
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves they just soothe my pain away

Felt so good to see the sun
I'll choose my time before I choose the one

Floating 'cross the waves the silence runs
My thoughts can go but now my sorrows done

Don't you know I've left and gone away?
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves they just soothe my pain away
