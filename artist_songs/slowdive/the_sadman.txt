I know there is
It all away
It all goes round
The house today

The reason why
You're leasing time
The sadman calls
He calls for you

The need to be
The sadman calls
He calls for you

The things you say
The songs that shine
For all the time

I count the ways
Your smile, the place
The sadman calls
He calls for you

You hurt my feelings, you needed me
The sadman calls
He calls for you
