She flies
She's gone to ride an angel's breath
Gone to taste a dream
And every time I call her
A shadow crawls away
But she takes
She laughs him all (...there is...)
And everything she owes me
She gives
She told me that she loved me
Love, just for a day
And all the time I feel her
I feel her fade away
But she takes
She gives him all the fakes
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day

She takes
She gives him all the (...shadows...)
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day
