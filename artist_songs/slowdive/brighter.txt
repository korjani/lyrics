She don't understand you
Her birth made of grain
She can now see the sun
And everyone said, yeah
You're better off dead but
She didn't know we were alone
And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time
She said don't you know, yeah
There's people in places
And places is what made her see
And everyone said yeah
She's better off dead but
She looked like she wanted to live
And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time
When it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
And when it's looking better
Just leave it all to time [x3]
