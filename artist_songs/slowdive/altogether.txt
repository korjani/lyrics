Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sleepyhead, where did you go?
I saw you turning but I couldn't catch your eye
It's alright, we're all together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And now seems just a dream
It broke my heart but then I guess you didn't know
It's alright, we're all together
Yeah, yeah

So tired
You're so right
I'm so tired
It's alright, tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sleepyhead, what did you know?
I saw you talking but I didn't hear a word
It's alright, we're all together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
