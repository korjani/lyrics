So tired
It's so hard to feel
But it's alright
Cause I believe
And I guess I'll dream
I guess I'll take the time to dream
It's alright
I'm just sleeping

Slow down
It's just always on my
Slow down
It's just always on my

So tired
Suicide is gone yeah
But it's alright
Cause I believe
And it's just a dream
It's always on your
It's just a dream
It's just always on your mind
