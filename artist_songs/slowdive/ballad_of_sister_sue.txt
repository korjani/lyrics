Don't tell me I'm lost if I don't seem too sure what to wear
Don't tell me I'm lost if I don't seem too sure what to wear
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by all I can't see
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by all I can't see

Dancing to nowhere, I'm losing my head among thieves
Dancing to nowhere, I'm losing my head among thieves
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed me
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed me

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold, I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes, I've sold them before

The man said the drink in his hand would be all he required
The man said the drink in his hand would be all he required
And it seemed much the same when he pointed a gun at his head
And it seemed much the same when he pointed a gun at his head
Filled it with lead

It made so much noise that I checked out of town, yeah
Blood on my face and the words of a sage on my mind
(It made so much noise that I checked out of town, yeah)

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold, I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes, I've sold them before
