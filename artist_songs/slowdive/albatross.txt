Looks like rain again
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I'm missing

I'm feeling now
I'm missing
Wishing
For the sun

Don't turn away
You're feeling
Feeling
Something new

Feels like yesterday
I can't believe
Can't believe
It's true

Looks like rain again
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I'm missing

I'm feeling now
That I'm wishing
Wishing
For the sun
