[DJ Paul (Juicy J):]
Yeah Its Goin' Down 
(Y'all Know What Time It Is) (Lil Jon!) 
Three 6 Mafia!!! 

[Chorus: Lil Jon (DJ Paul)]
Goose got me loose 
gone off patron 
Money in my pocket 
And I'm all up in the zone like 
(Oooh Imma act a damn fool!)
(Oooh Imma bout to act a fool!) 

[Verse 1 - Lil Jon]
Crunk tonight just got paid 
Pocket full of motherfucking money okay
Imma ball till I fall 
Drank till I can't 
Put on my black card I got money in da bank
Patron on the table crunk n goose 
Drank what u want bitch gon' get loose
(Oooh) Act a fool till they cut the lights on 
And we still ain't goin' home 
Till all the liquor gone
I just don't give a fuck 
Standin' on the table with the weed fired up 
Drankin out the bottle mother fuck a cup 
I'll pour it in your mouth 
Lean back and open up 
(Oooh) Crunk ain't dead bitch 
You see the chain 
And I'm the king fool you know my name 
party like a rockstar fucked like a pornstar 
I don't give a damn I'm about the whole bar 

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2 - DJ Paul]
Yes sir a nigga on tonight 
I got my money lookin right 
But I ain't tryin' to fight
If a sucka touch me 
Best believe it's on 
Get cracked crush your dome 
With a bottle of patron 
Right here right 
Real fast in a hurry 
I hit a sucka so hard 
I'll make his vision get blurry
And I'm too clean for this 
I'm too lean for this 
Figured It would have happen 
So I brought my team for this 

[Verse 3 - Juicy J]
Yes sir I'm the realest playa trap star 
Sellin the biggest brickes 
I'm the realest playa rap bar 
Smokin' purpleish
Step up in the club 
I got some love cuz a nigga rich 
Girl between my legs 
Doin' me up like a licourish 
25 stacks at the bar 
Ice on my wrist 
Step up to this pimpin' 
Get your braided hair wig split 
Back up off in my chevy 
Brains blown out peanut butter
Ridin high stay high 
I'm talkin like st-st-stutter

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4 - Lil Jon]
Get crunk in this motherfucker throw yo hood up 
get crunk in this motherfucker throw yo hood up 
Get drunk in this motherfucker hold ya dranks up 
Get drunk in this motherfucker hold ya dranks up 
Lean back in this motherfucker turn that bottle up 
Lean back in this motherfucker turn that bottle up 
Throw them stacks up bitch make it rain nigga what 
Throw them stacks up bitch make it rain nigga what

[Chorus x2]
