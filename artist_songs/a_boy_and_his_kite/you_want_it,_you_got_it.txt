Looking for a still small voice inside
It echoes past whispering where to find
A light that shines stronger than darkness hides
It’s a sea of bright. Oh I’m blind, I see the light
You want it, you got it. Oh everything
Your love, yeah it always, lights a fire in me
Holding on to the words that ring my soul
Screaming out. Shaking my bones, shaking, I’m on the floor
You want it, you got it. Oh everything
Your love, yeah it always, lights a fire in me
I am blind in a sea of bright light
