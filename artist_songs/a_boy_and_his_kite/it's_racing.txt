Maybe I can try come on baby I have to fight
Fire with flames burning up, bellowing inside
All is safe. No wound too deep to break
My heart will pace the fight it has to make
All the way our love will be the same
Till darkness fades into light
Maybe I can try come on baby I have to fight
Fire with rain pouring down, washing up the flame
All is safe. No wound too deep to break
My heart remains this fight it has to make
All the way our love will be the same
Till darkness fades into light
Can you feel my heart. It’s racing. It’s chasing
Can you feel my heart. It’s racing. It’s chasing you
