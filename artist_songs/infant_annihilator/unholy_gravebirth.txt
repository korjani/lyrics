Oh Father, I have done as you wished:
Gathering the implements of the conjuration
I now read from the sacrament made with the skin of virgin genitals
Their screams echo like thunder within these monuments of stone
The blood of the severed now stains my blade;
The sacrificed; the newborn flesh
I have been patient long enough
Prophecies have spoken of one -
The one who could bare such potency
Accounts of anaemic attempts have been visible throughout centuries
I bestow the heads of virgins and the first-born sons
Upon this slab, slowly slicing at her uterus to ensure I don’t deface this newborn clitoris
Upon this slab, slowly slicing at her uterus to ensure each incision doesn’t deface the beauty of this newborn clitoris
Craving to caress the severed skin of her anus while groping the gristle as it slides down my penis
I bestow the heads of virgins and first-born sons
The horns of the lamb and intestines of the children
(Prophecies have spoken of one)
The one who could bare such potency
Accounts of anaemic attempts have been visible throughout centuries
I bestow the heads of virgins and the first-born sons
The horns of the lamb and intestines of the children
Arise, oh Necromantic Lord!
