Ruins of monuments and foetal carcasses line the continents
Continuously crawling from the mouth of the abyss, my minions, viciously ingesting

They have come to conquer the cunt and slay the offspring
Harvesting the land of putridity, harnessing its treacherous essence
Aroused by the extermination: I, the apocalypse inseminator
Bow to my infestation; the era of infant annihilation
The stench of faeces and fertile flesh drifts across the dawn horizon
The moist skin of foetuses gleam as the sun peaks through the darkness
The mist lingering over the lakes, now cesspools of human remains
Clears to reveal a mountainous landscape of piled cadavers

Perched upon my throne, foetal limbs falling from my teeth
Slaved harlots by my side sliding down my colossal cock
The conveyor belt descending the monolithic manor bearing the birthspawn of I
The Elysian Grandeval Galèriarch

Perched upon my throne, foetal limbs falling from my teeth
The mist lingering over the lakes, now cesspools of human remains
Clears to reveal a mountainous landscape of piled cadavers
The last great pharaoh to this bloodline of rape

A ruinous prophecy of blasphemous paedophilic triumph
We freely fondle and defile the desperate descendants
The angelic servants disfigured and maimed beyond all recognition or hope
Behold these fragile boys...

They have seen too few winters to form their own regret
But their pain and desperation is hideously apparent

The stench of faeces and fertile flesh drifts across the dawn horizon
The moist skin of foetuses gleam as the sun peaks through the darkness
Behold – Blasphemian

Infant annihilation
