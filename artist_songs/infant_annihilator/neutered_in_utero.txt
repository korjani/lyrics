Reversed caesarian procedure, flesh shredded; mess excess.
Epidermis carved away by a serrated blade, the womb exposed.
Enclosed is an underdeveloped foetus.

Human error eraser; mistake replacer designed to terminate.
Ovarian killer; foetal exterminator.

Frenzied slashes from my scalpel leave your womb dissected.
Frantically clawing for the trophy of flesh to keep this cock erected.
Split half like a ruined temple of a whore, cursed with a child you regret.
I shall remove and delegate the pieces of your filthy abortion,
Separating the child from the mother's sack.

Fluids rush as I break through the uterine lining with my cock,
Slamming into her vaginal wall.
As I slit her throat I gaze into her eyes.
I gaze into her eyes.
And then she smiles.

The whore moans with each incision.
Her legs tremble as she bleeds.

A careless laceration;
I peer inside and purge the fleshling of this embryonic cradle.
Neutered in utero;
The essence of life removed from this unborn child.

Ovarian killer; foetal exterminator.

Systematic defilement of the world's entire child population.
The unwanted filth laid forth by religious mistresses alike.
Impregnate to satisfy the chapel;
A vicious cycle justified by its disciples.

Deconstruct the whorespawn entombed; dead before they leave the womb.
Neutered children offered to our God.

Vile vultures, carnage serpents prey upon these mortals
Exposing the bastard children to carve the genital flesh,
Removing the penile meat to display upon the altar of malignant divinity.

Eternally we reign.
We neuter.

"Dear Lord, do you hear me calling?"

"Silence, peasant. You've defied the oracle and tainted my name."

"These offerings are less than worthless."

"Now kneel and abide by my word: I demand the pelt of those deemed innocent."
