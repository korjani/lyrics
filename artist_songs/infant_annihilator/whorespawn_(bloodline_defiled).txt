Flowing through my veins is the key to my papal power: An ancient
bloodline; well maintained to avoid dilution. The Progenitor is the
Father of Lies. The sovereign source for this power dwells within me -
Inside my form. He lurks beneath my skin and stares through my eyes.
Through me he has the power to instil the re-written doctrine to the
church. Beware the wolf in sheep skin preying on the weak. I am the
host of Satan. Parasites thriving in my blood harbour his soul in my
surrogate subjugation. My fidelity lies with he who now grows inside
of me. I, his vicar in the physical realm, feed him innocent blood as
a sacrifice; the blood of infants and the blood of nuns. With great
power comes great hypocrisy. With great power comes satanic adoration.
With great power comes great hypocrisy. With great power comes the
sacrificial blood of innocence. Beware the wolf in sheep skin preying
on the weak. Wet with this blood I’m a demigod; a flesh incarnate
vessel. In this world of flesh and blood I feel the urge to fuck. This
endless hunger to fuck and smother is driving me to rape the nuns. I
feel the urge to reproduce, but the bloodline must stay intact. With
death I purify the whorespawn blood.
