You have been gathered here to kill every child under two; every
pregnant mother too. We will stop the second coming of Christ. I the
Pope bow to no one - yet alone bow to God. I will slaughter everyone
before I risk the power vested in me. Assemble the legions of priests
and vow to me that every infant will die. Promise to me that Christ
will hang; nailed to a cross before he’s three. Arise and become an
ordained clergy of plague, all sweeping across the world to cleanse.
Crucify the children in the streets for all the world to see. The
prophecies cannot be fulfilled. If they are we will be exposed for
what we have truly become: Perverts draped in robes claiming to be
embodiments of God. Kill him before we are exposed. Erase him so no
one knows what we have become. Now bring me the head of the infant
Jesus Christ impaled on my sword, so that I may mount it on my wall. I
will rule forever. Bring me the head of the infant Jesus Christ.
