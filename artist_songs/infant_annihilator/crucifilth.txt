Hysteria possesses the population as the vortex consumes the clouds
The catalyst of the conjuration opens a doorway to our realm

"Emerge from the bowels of the ethereal pathway, a labyrinthian hell, projecting a bellow that quakes the gallows!"
He came with an open hand of misery: eternal doom
"Oh great pharaoh of suffering."
The sirens silence behind the harmony of slaughter
A symphony of butchery
An orchestration of annihilation

Feasting the newborn meat - a sloppy sadistic supper straight from the womb. The cattle of the religious farm
"Oh, it eases the sadomasochistic seizures; slurping up the embryos as we fuck the cunts they came from."
The sanity in this world withers away as the chaotic reality illuminates
Kingdoms crumble under exponential rape

"Pray, please pray. I want to see your face as your children gape while my minions build a shrine of infant remains."

Crucifilth
"Skin your child before the cross."

"Pray to me as your children gape."
"Fear the cock of your master."

"The servant offspring you keep pushing... We must stop you from reproducing."
Every woman and child is sentenced to death by crucifixion while religious leaders watch and suffocate on their excrement

"I, the father of infanticide."
"I, the necrotic behemoth, reconstructing my necropolis."

"Erect as I watch generations fall to their knees, sipping on my concoction of sacramental youth - the virgin blood of newborn nutrients."
"Seek the new holy virgin carrying the incarnation of Christ."

"Bastard Child!"

"I must plant the seed of impurity."
"Another son to cast from heaven, soiling his divinity; another spawn to fear: The one to inherit my throne once I've wiped this world clean of sin."
