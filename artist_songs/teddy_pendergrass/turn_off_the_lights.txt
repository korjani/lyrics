Turn off the lights and light a candle
Tonight I'm in a romantic mood, yeah

Let's take a shower, shower together
I'll wash your body and you'll wash mine, yeah
Rub me down in some hot oils, baby, yeah
And I'll do the same thing to you

Just turn off the lights, come to me
Girl, I wanna give you a special treat, you're so sweet
Turn off the lights and let's get cozy
See, you're the only one in the world that I need

I wanna love you, love you all over, yeah
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
Whisper sweet words of love in your ear
Show you how much I missed you, missed you, my dear

Turn 'em off and come to me
Tonight, I'm in a sexy mood, baby and light a candle
Girl, there's something that I, I wanna do to you
I wanna do, I wanna do to you, baby

Would you mind if I asked you to
Would you rub me down
Would you rub me down in some, in some burnin' hot oils, baby, yeah
I swear, I can do the same thing, the same thing to you, baby

Turn 'em off and let's get cozy
I wanna give you a special treat, you've been so sweet
Turn 'em off and come closer
You're the only one in this whole wide world that I'd ever need

Turn 'em off and light a candle
You see, there's somethin' I, somethin' I, somethin' I, somethin' I
Somethin' I wanna do to you, baby

I'm lyin' here waitin', my dear
You can get what you want any time you want it
I'm lyin' here waitin', my dear
Come get what you need, give me what I need
