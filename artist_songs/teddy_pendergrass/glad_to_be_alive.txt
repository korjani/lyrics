You can do it, anything you want
You can do it if you try
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide

You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I got a reason
I'm so glad
So you're feelin' down
Got no one around, oh, no
Wish you had that someone {To make you feel}
Every day you're glad to be alive
World just keeps on turnin'
Spinnin' 'round and 'round all the time
If you have a dream {Like Dr. King}
Don't let 'em drag you down, no

You can do it, anything you want
You can do it if you try
You can make the world a better place
Don't try to hide {Ho}

You can have it any way you want
Take your time to decide
Now I got a reason
I'm glad to be alive
One boy meets a girl {Woo, woo, uh}
Then they fall in love {The story goes}
They can change the world {Every day}
Everybody's glad to be alive
What's the use in tryin', oh
Look at all the people {With no brain}
Ain't no use in cryin', no {Ain't no way}
You can find a way, oh

You can do it, anything you want {Oh}
