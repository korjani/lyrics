Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you
When my days and nights are lonely
And friends are few
I find everything in you

Sweet smelling fragrance like a rose
You're so, so, so warm, I'm happy in you
I wake up to the morning sun
Kiss you then I'm on the run

Sometimes work gets so hard
Everyday thoughts of you
Gets me through
I find everything in you

Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you

?? love on me
I'll be here for you only
Nothing can take a place of you
I thank God for bringing us together
In my eyes you're a treasure, it's such a pleasure

When I wake up to the morning sun
Kiss you then I'm on the run
All I do is think about you baby, all day long
My love song, I find happiness in you, baby

Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you

Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you

Everything, everything I find
Everything, baby
Everything, everything, everything in you
Everything, everything, everything in you
Everything, everything, every, baby

Everything I want I find in you
Everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you

Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
I find everything in you

Everything that I think that I want
I find it in you, girl
Oh, you've been so good to me
I can never leave you baby
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Everything I want I find in you
Everything in you
Everything I want I find in you
Everything in you

Everything I want I find in you
Everything in you
