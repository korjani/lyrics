Oh baby
Oh baby

I dreamed of you last night
And oh, your face was so very clear
All I could do is think about the good times
That you and I used to share

I could still remember the last time
Oh, I held you in my arms
But all those days have come and gone now
And all I seem to do is cry

It hurts
(It hurts)
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love
(Our love)
Could last throughout eternity
Now it's history, baby

It should've been you
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
Was meant to be

But if I had you, oh babe
This time you'd see
You would have all my love
I kept inside of me
(I kept inside)

Well, have you got somebody else
Yes, I've got somebody too
But you know I've finally realized
No one could ever take the place of you, no

I'm not the one to place the blame
Or for whatever the fault just might be
All I need is to find a little happiness
Oh, in life that will fulfill me

It's you
(It's you)
It's you that means more to me
Without your love
It's nothin' more than fantasy
Baby, come back to me

It should've been you, oh girl
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
Was meant to be

It should've been you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
But my eyes were closed and I didn't see

Oh, it should've been you, baby
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
That was meant to be, was meant to be, meant to be, babe

Oh, if I had you, girl
This time you'll see
This time you would have all the love
All the love, all the love that I kept inside of me

You know so much time has passed
Since you and I've being together
So much time till I
I don't know quite how to start

All I know is that from that day until this
You remain on my mind and in my heart
You know I was never really clear
Just what went wrong

I guess that's why I had to write this song
If I know then what I know now
I would have never let you go
No way, no

Oh, it hurts
(It hurts)
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love
Could last throughout eternity
Now it's history, whoa, baby

It should've been you
It should've been me
It might've been all those things in life
That was meant to be

I know, I know, I know, I know it should've you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
But my eyes were closed and I can't be seen

It should've been you
Oh, it should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
That was meant to be, that was meant to be, oh

Oh, I know if I had you, girl
I know this time you'll see
I'll show you, baby
You could have all my love
All the love, all the love I kept wrapped up inside of me, oh yeah

Why don't you give me one more chance
If you wanna be with me
Take a chance with me, baby
I woke up this morning with you on my mind

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Come on
Try it again
Let's start all over
We can make it work this time
Come on
