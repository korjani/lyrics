Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

I don't feel like bein' lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
You're the kind, you're the kind
Whose spirits are runnin' free

Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you won't be under any kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let, we'll just let the evenin' flow

Come on and go with me
I'd sure like that, baby
Come on over to my place
It would be so nice, it would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noisy crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody, there's nobody else around

Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, 'cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me

Come on and go with me
Would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?
Would you do that, baby?
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

My car's right outside, we can leave right now
That's if you're ready to go
I know you're just beatin' me
You see, I'd understand it
I'd understand it if you said no
But don't you do it, baby

Come on and go with me, come on, baby
(No)
Come on over to my place
(No, not tonight, no)
You see it's not far from here
(I believe you)

Would you just take a minute and think about it?
(Oh, man)
Would you just think about it, think about it? Yeah
(I'm thinkin' about it but I really have to say no)

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
(No, I know)
You're sittin' here, you've been sittin' here for quite a long time
(Yeah, I'm slightly bored, I hate bein' bored)

See, I've been watchin' you
(I've been doin' the same thing)
I've had my eyes on you
(I've been checkin' you out all night long)
You look so nice and you look so sweet
(Oh, thank you)

Come on and go with me
(That was sweet)
You look like you oughta be with me
Come on, over to my place
(Yeah, but what are you gonna with me? That's the problem)

Seems that you feel the same way I do
(I think it would pretty interesting)
It seems that you need some company, too
(Oh, boy)
Yeah

Come on and go with me
(You said your car is right outside, right in front)
Come on, over to my place
(And you're gonna bring me home after)
But would it be all right with you?

Come on and go with me
If we left here and we went somewhere else, baby
(Come on over to my place)
Somewhere where it's nice and quiet, nice and quiet
(That's nice, yeah, that sounds a little better than this place)
Where we could sit down by a cozy lit fire
We could sip a little wine, work things out
(Oh, yeah)

Come on and go with me, work things out
(Well, I cannot stay long)
Come on over to my place
(We got an hour, no more than that)
Lady, you won't be under any kinda pressure
(Please, I cannot stand pressure)

I wouldn't do that, baby? No
(Okay, well, would you get my coat?)
See, I wouldn't do that, baby
See, I just wanna sit down
And get to know you a little better
(Okay, just for a little while)

I swear you look so good to me
(Are you gonna pay for my drink?)
Come on over to my place
You look so good to me
