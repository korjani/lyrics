Oh baby, you know I hate to beg
And I really hate to rush you girl
We've been knowin' each other for so long
And I really think it's time to let go, baby

Oh baby, don't you feel my heart
It's missing some excitement and you're the missing part
You're the missing part that can heal my lonely nights
You're the missing part that's makes my day so bright
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need in my life
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can't you feel my love, it's calling you
To a romantic rendezvous
I believe every heart wants to feel real love
I don't think true love is a mystery, it's right here for you

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Please be careful, baby, how you talk to me
'Cause I have a fragile heart and it's broken easily
And if it's broken I may never love again
And it will be so sad, sweet darling
To live without my friend

Can't you feel my love it's calling you baby
To a romantic rendezvous
Well, each and every heart wants to feel real, real love
I want you to know that my love is here for you

See let me in your heart
You're the only one I want
In my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, life

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need
