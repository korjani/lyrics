Just call me Supawoman
'Cause there's nothing that I can't do
I'm looking for a man of steel and it might be you

Just call me Supawoman
Are you ready for who I am?
I'm strong and independent
And I'm looking for that kind of man
Your Supawoman

I met a lot of guys who looked into my eyes
And told me they could handle everything I had inside
But as the time went by, I see they didn't have a clue
Till the day that I met

You walked into my life and then you took control
I couldn't help myself, I wanted you, I let it go
I had to let you in to see if what I saw in you was true
I need to spend some time with you

So tell me, baby, if you're cool to be
With someone who's as real as me

Just call me Supawoman
'Cause there's nothing that I can't do
I'm looking for a man of steel and it might be you

Just call me Supawoman
Are you ready for who I am?
I'm strong and independent
And I'm looking for that kind of man
Your Supawoman

I say what's on my mind, I never hold it back
I call it how it is, tell me, baby, can you deal with that?
I promise if you can, you're gonna be a happy man
And I could be the one to

Rub your back at night and cook your dinner too
And when you got a problem I've got some advice for you
And if you ever fall, don't worry, baby, I'll be there to catch you
Can your ego handle that?

So tell me if you're cool to be
With someone who's as real as me

Just call me Supawoman
'Cause there's nothing that I can't do
I'm looking for a man of steel and it might be you

Just call me Supawoman
Are you ready for who I am?
I'm strong and independent
And I'm looking for that kind of man
Your Supawoman

I'll protect you
Represent you
Let's fly away
Come with me
I'm here to save the day

Just call me Supawoman
'Cause there's nothing that I can't do
I'm looking for a man of steel and it might be you

Just call me Supawoman
Are you ready for who I am?
I'm strong and independent
And I'm looking for that kind of man

Just call me Supawoman
'Cause there's nothing that I can't do
I'm looking for a man of steel and it might be you

Just call me Supawoman
Are you ready for who I am?
I'm strong and independent
And I'm looking for that kind of man
Your Supawoman
