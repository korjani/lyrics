Oh, when the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging 'round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'

Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'

Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
