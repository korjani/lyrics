I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called lonely street?

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

Maybe on this lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

Who came to bury a broken dream
And watch an old love die

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
