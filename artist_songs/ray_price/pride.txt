You want her attention
Well you'll have to wait
She's in the gymnasium
Reducing weight

In shorts of a leotard
Despite her age
The girl's gonna exercise
Your life away

Sister don't you jog it all away
Sister don't you run it all off
Sister don't you jog it all away
Sister don't you rough it all up

What an idea of fun
To get it on the run
I don't know why you do
What has come over you?

The style in the discotheque
Is cheap and nice
Please tell Ms Fonda
To reduce her price

Anorexia nervosa mannequin
All this physicality
Will wear you thin

Hey Olivia Newton-John
What you say?
Hey Olivia Newton-John
What you say?

She used to yield like flesh
Now it's all muscle
She used to yield like flesh
Now it's all muscle

I don't know why you do
What has come over you
What an idea of fun
To get it on the run

Rollerskates and vitamins and diet plans
Academic discipline will ruin your hands
We used to ride tandem and have lots of fun
But bicycles for exercise are made for one
