(Until the day God calls me home)
My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home
But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while
And things of earth that 'cause this heart to tremble
Remember there will only bring a smile
But until then my heart will go on singing...
