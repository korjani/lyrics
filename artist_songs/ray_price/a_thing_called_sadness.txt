It's a thing called sadness
It's been here since you've been gone it's been hanging round too long
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
In every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
What in the world am I gonna do this old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back mem'ries of you and all the things that we used to do
In every chair...
