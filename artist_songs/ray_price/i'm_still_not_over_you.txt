Today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd be
I had to know if you still had the same effect on me
And the moment that I saw you there, I knew
No matter what I do, I'm still not over you

I'm still not over you, that feeling's still the same
I'm still not over you, I find that nothing's changed
And perhaps some day, I'll find somebody new
But now it's much too soon, I'm still not over you

I can't explain why seeing you affects my sanity
But when I see you, I become a strange and different me
And the moment that I saw you there, I knew
No matter what I do, I'm still not over you

I'm still not over you, I find that nothing's changed
I'm still not over you, that feeling's still the same
And perhaps some day, I'll find somebody new
But now it's much too soon, I'm still not over you
No matter what I do, I'm still not over you
