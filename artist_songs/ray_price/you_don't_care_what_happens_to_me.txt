Darlin', I love you so and it's kind of hard to know
That you don't care what happens to me
When the shadows creep through how I worry over you
Well, you don't care what happens to me.

I wanted a true love that never would die
But somehow it just couldn't be
Now the tears dim my eyes everytime I realize
That you don't care what happens to me.

Darlin', let's not pretend 'cause our love affair must end
You don't care what happens to me
Now I know in my heart that I only played a part
Cause you don't care what happens to me.

I'll try and forget you and start life anew
I know that you're glad to be free
Give me one goodbye kiss 'cause you can't go on like this
Oh, you don't care what happens to me...
