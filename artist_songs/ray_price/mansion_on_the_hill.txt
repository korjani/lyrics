Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love to give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow in your loveless mansion on the hill
The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so lonesome and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
