I've had to burn most every bridge I've crossed
It seems like every time I've loved, I'd lost
When I met you, I thought the time would turn
Now you're just another bridge to burn

I'll soon light the match and move on
I've already waited much too long
Now I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned
And our love's just another bridge to burn

Sometimes one must love enough for two
And that's how it's been with me and you
Now I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned
And our love's just another bridge to burn

I'll soon light the match and move on
I've already waited much too long
Now I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned
And our love's just another bridge to burn
