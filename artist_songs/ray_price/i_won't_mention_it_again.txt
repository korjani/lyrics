I know you're tired of being of all I ever wanted
You'll no longer feel the love I have for you
What happens now, what will I do with all the mem'ries?
And the dreams of all the things we'll never do

But I won't mention it again I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again, I won't mention it again

I feel my life has reached an early sign of autumn
In my heart the leaves are falling love is cold
And everything that once was warm and new is gone now
Leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul

But I won't mention it again I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again, I won't mention it again
