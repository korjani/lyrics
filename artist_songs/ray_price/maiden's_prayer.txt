When the evening falls twilight shadows find
There beneath the stars an Indian maiden divine
The moon is on high and seems to see her there
In her eyes there's a light shining ever so bright
As she whispers a silent prayer
Every word reveals an empty broken heart
Broken by fate that's keepin' them so far apart
Lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above
In her arms he belongs and her prayer is a song
Her undying song of love

Every word reveals an empty broken heart...
