Might as well admit it you don't really love me 
you've been acting funny for so long
It hurts to think that you think you're above me
But it hurts more to admit that I've been wrong
Need a bottle and a table I can find those

Maybe they will help speed up time's crazy crawl
Might as well go around and join the vines 
ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
Yes pride goes before a fall I've got a feeling
That I'm gonna seek much more than them all

When we first met I lived way above the city
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
Pour the wine dim the lights and play the Juke box
Dance with every Sue and Betty that's around

Take her out and try your luck that's what's expected
What's the difference it can't bring your honour down
You are now a full fledged member of the rat race
Forget everything that's decent have a ball

What's the difference if you die in this old back place
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
