Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I need you so
In life we search and some of us find I've looked for you a long long time
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
Walk through this world with me go where I go
Dream all my dreams with me I've searched for you so
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
