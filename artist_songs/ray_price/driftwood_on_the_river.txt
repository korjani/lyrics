I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I'll keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be

I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two
But it's always good luck how we've got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous

Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pity, I'll just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone

I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes, the careless one who has forgotten me

In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret
