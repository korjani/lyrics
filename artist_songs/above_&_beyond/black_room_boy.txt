It's the same old scene
You've been stuck at the screen for a lifetime
You keep your mind sharp and clean
With a fix of caffeine for the night time

You got a page full of friends
And a world without end, DIKU?
But if push comes to shove
You could do without them if they make you

With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up
You've been living a lie in your white room

For all the hours that you've cried
There's a year of love they denied
So you slip through the door and fall to the floor in your black room

You're a black room boy
You're feeling so way down
You're a black room boy
Forget the losses and burn down
You're a black room boy
Fall into city lights
You're a black room boy
Nothing else to be

You kissed your mommy's hand
Wearing daddy's ring when they left you
And you buried yourself in the pain that they couldn't accept you
You're in a world of your own

Got no cellular phone
They can't track you
But the girl at the store with the sketchy rapport
She will back you

With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up
You've been living a lie in your white room

For all the hours that you've cried
There's a year of love they denied
So you slip through the door and fall to the floor in your black room

You're a black room boy
You're feeling so way down
You're a black room boy
Forget the losses and burn down
You're a black room boy
Fall into city lights
You're a black room boy
Nothing else to be

You're feeling so way down
Forget the losses and burn down
Fall into city lights
Nothing else to be

You're a black room boy
