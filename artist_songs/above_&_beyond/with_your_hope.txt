Connected to talk
singing through a forest of ice
This slow motion moment is tumbling down
Till we're lost inside the sound

It's your worst fall
you push me through the walls
And I just can't cope
You're breaking my heart with your hope
You’re breaking my heart with your hope

You’re breaking my heart with your hope
You’re breaking my heart with your hope
