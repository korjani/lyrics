Adalae, your every moment is a masterpiece
Adalae, you're only precious 'til you meet your needs
Adalae, you say we'll see you on the silver screen
But when you're down
You know this town's just not for you

Adalae, everybody knows you're working hard
Adalae, you see the sunset on the boulevard
Adalae, your only enemy's the calendar
With these complaints for dedications tried and true
And since you always get your way, this one's for you

Oh Adalae, I think you're losing your head
Let's take these rumors and put them to bed
Can't help but think that it was something I said
Cursing at the stars above

Adalae, maybe you'll never get a second chance
Adalae, you're only social on the stimulants
It's OK cause everybody knows your circumstance
So arch your back girl cause you're always on display
And you know you're only worth what you get paid

Oh Adalae, I think you're losing your head
Let's take these rumors and put them to bed
Can't help but think that it was something I said
Cursing at the stars above

Oh Adalae I know the sun's in your eyes
You've got it all but still you wear a disguise
Whatever you do, don't you apologize
Nobody can buy your love

Adalae, your every moment is a masterpiece
Adalae, you're only precious 'til you meet your needs
