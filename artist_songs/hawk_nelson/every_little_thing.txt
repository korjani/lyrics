I saw her yesterday
And I never felt a feeling like the one I felt today
And now she's taking over me
I've never met anyone like you
Cause I never could find the words to write you

She's been on my mind (she's working overtime)
She's got perfect reasons
Says she loves to talk to Jesus
I think I believe her when she says
Life can be so simple if we'd all just learn to pray

She's got every little thing I wanted
And it still feels just like the day it started
I'll say goodbye to the broken-hearted
And I could never express the way I felt before tonight

She sits there all alone
She's reading from a chapter that she sometimes calls her own
And now she's taken over me
This girl I once rejected
Has now become the girl of my dreams

She's got every little thing I wanted
And it still feels just like the day it started
I'll say goodbye to the broken-hearted
And I could never express the way I felt before tonight

She's not an ordinary girl
I see it in her eyes
I'm just an ordinary boy
God must have heard my prayers last night

She's been on my mind (she's working overtime)

And it still feels just like the day it started
So say goodbye to the broken-hearted
And I could never express the way I felt before tonight

She's not an ordinary girl
I can see it in her eyes
I'm just an ordinary boy
