From Underneath I wanted you
To see the first thing I ever poured my heart into
You'll never know the pain that I've been through
I'm not so sure you'll ever know
And so I'll make you understand the words that built my life
Were not from you, but from my father's hand

Do you remember that cold day in December
Leaving everything you knew behind
I may never know how it feels to stand beside you
Or take your hand when I need some direction
And I may never know what it's like to see you smile back at me
Or know you'd be proud of me

From underneath I promise to erase the past
And let my heart forgive the former you
Replace the dark of old and start brand new
I never thought I'd see the day
I walk toward the end of life and turn the other way
I'm reaching out to take my Father's hand
