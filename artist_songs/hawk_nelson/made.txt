Why do you hide from who you are?
Why do you run from the mirror, pretend to be who you're not?
Why do you fight to accept yourself?
Aren't you more than the tears you've cried and the fear you've felt?

Oh, tell me what you see
Tell me what you see
And I'll tell you something else

You're beautiful, wonderful
Perfectly made, perfectly made
You're meant to be what you see
You're not a mistake, not a mistake

Brighter than stars that shine
You light up the Maker's eyes
And you'd believe if you could see
The smile on His face
The moment you were made
Made

Lift up your face
Now is your time
'Cause everything changes when you find yourself in His light

So tell me what you see, what you see
And I'll tell you what He sees

You're beautiful, wonderful
You're perfectly made, perfectly made
You're meant to be what you see
You're not a mistake, not a mistake

Brighter than stars that shine
You light up the Maker's eyes
And you'd believe if you could see
The smile on His face
The moment you were made
Made

Before the sun was given light
Before you opened up your eyes
Inside out, soul and heart
He made you to be who you are

Before the sun was given light
Before you opened up your eyes
Inside out, soul and heart
He made you to be who you are

You're beautiful, wonderful
You're perfectly made, perfectly made
You're meant to be what you see
You're not a mistake, not a mistake

Brighter than stars that shine
You light up the Maker's eyes
And you'd believe if you could see
The smile on His face
The moment you were made
Made, made, made
