Grown up, now it's my turn
Dare me to make my move
Nowhere to go
And I still don't know
But I'll make it through
Times change, change like the wind
I'm blown away again
Goodbye to my friends
New life begins
Without you
These were the days the choices we make
Decide who we will be
And where we go
As we say goodbye
The look in your eye is screaming silently
Remember to never forget
Move on, watching you live
Dying to be like you
I'd go back in time
But I can't press rewind
Sad but true
Broke down, I'll be okay
I'm gonna make it through
I won't be afraid
Starting today
Without you
Don't you ever forget
