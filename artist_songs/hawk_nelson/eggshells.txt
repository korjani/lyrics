I'm tired of the eggshells we've been walking on
We've been here for far too long
Remember standing on the pier
Even the ocean couldn't come between us
Now the sound of your words seemed so turned around
Last time I should have said I'm sorry
But all my pride made me keep ignoring
That the deadline is up when the sun goes down
If I could catch the words before they left my mouth, I'd do it
If I could reach right out and turn them all around, I'd do it
But it's out there yeah I said it
And in a way I don't regret it
'Cause I won't sit back and let us slip away
I'm tired of the eggshells we've been walking on
We've been here for far too long
Hey do you know what happened to the good times?
Rolling like the thunder in the night sky
Now we seem so far out of reach
Everyone knows, everyone gets older
And you can't stop running until it's over
'Cause the love we had is always few and far between
We need to take action for what we've done
Not act like there's nothing wrong
