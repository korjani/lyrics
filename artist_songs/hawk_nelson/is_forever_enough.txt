What makes all of us hate? 
We're all the same 
We roll the dice 
And we play your game 
We complicate 
Show us the way 
Before it's too late 
And the whole thing breaks

We have a name
We all create 
Everything else, 
the mistakes we made 
We'll make a change 
We'll concentrate 
Before we suffocate 

Can't hold this in 
And keep it quiet any longer 
I've fallen in 
And now this feeling's getting stronger 

Take my breath away 
Now I'm trying to get up 
I'm trying to retrace 
My steps back 
To wherever I messed up 
Is forever enough? 
I'm holding on 
I know you'll be there 
Whenever I wake up 

What makes everything change? 
We're not the same 
We all get stuck in the same clich© 
We're taking aim 
We dominate 
Put on the pressure 
Then the whole thing breaks 
How come we wait? 
Why do we hate? 
We're falling away like the last crusade 
We rearrange 
We need to change 
before we suffocate 

Can't hold this in 
And keep it quiet any longer 
I've fallen in 
And now this feeling's getting stronger 

Can't hold this in 
And keep it quiet any longer 
I've fallen in 
And now this feeling's getting stronger 

Take my breath away 
Now I'm trying to get up 
I'm trying to retrace 
My steps back 
To where ever I messed up 
Is forever enough? 
I'm holding on 
I know you'll be there whenever I wake up 

(Now I'm trying to get up)
I'm trying to retrace 
I've fallen in 
(and now this feeling's getting stronger) 

You take my breath away 
Now I'm trying to get up 
I'm trying to retrace 
my steps back 
to where ever I messed up 
Is forever enough? (Is forever enough?) 
I'm holding on 
I know you'll be there 
Whenever I wake up 
Whenever I wake up 
I know you'll be there whenever I wake up 
Whenever I wake up 
If I wake up! 

What makes all of us hate? 
Show us the way 
Before it' too late
And the whole thing breaks
