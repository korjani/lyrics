It's over, it's over 
Twelve days later and I can't start over 
I left her, she hates me 
We've been friends since 1990 
Don't tell me it's over 

I need you more than the sun 
She's telling me that we're done 
I can't believe that it's over 

I need you more than the sun 
She's telling me that we're done 
I can't believe that it's over 
I should've known all along 

It's over, it's over 
Three months later but I can't console her 
I'm run down, I'm clinging
Left a message, but her phone's not ringing 

It's over, so over 
The sun is shining but my heart is sober 
Pretending I'm alright 
Sleep all day cuz I stay up all night 
Don't tell me it's over 

I need you more than the sun 
She's telling me that we're done 
I can't believe that it's over 

I need you more than the sun 
She's telling me that we're done 
I can't believe that it's over 

I should've known all along 
I should've known all along 

I need you more than the sun 
I need you more than the sun 

I need you more than the sun 
I need you more than the sun 

You're telling me that we're done 
I can't believe that it's over 

You're telling me that we're done 
It's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, it's over, we're done 

I need you more than I thought 
This past week I learned a lot 
And now you tell me it's over
