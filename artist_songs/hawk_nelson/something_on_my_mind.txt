Take the train,
Go separate ways,
And leave it long forgotten.
I'll hang my hat, and
I won't be back.
On my way out,
I'm feeling lame.
Am I to blame?
Or am I just too jaded?
And I won't be back,
what'd ya think of that?

When it feels like life's wastin' away,
I can say: that when
There's something on my mind,
It takes my concentration.
Just wanna lay it on the line,
Avoid all confrontation.
I'm gonna say this one more time
for all my generation,
you'll never, ever pull my lever
not today and not forever
(not today and not forever)

Take the fame
And change my name
Because my jacket's faded
And I'll change my hat
No we can't have that
(you'll be looking at a brand new cat)
It's all made up.
I've had enough
Of this circulation.
If you write me back,
I'll tell you where it's at.
