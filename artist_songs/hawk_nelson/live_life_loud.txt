Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up

Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up

I got a hankering for something special
Tonight's the night it becomes official
Don't stop the rock, hold both your hands up
Show these people how to shake things up

I'm not sitting down 'til I'm older
And I'm not shuttin' up 'til it's over
Raise your hands and shout if you're with me
Once we start, it won't make a difference

If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, let me hear you
Takin' all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living

I started figuring with good intentions
Listen up now, give me your attention
Don't make a sound if you don't believe me
You won't wake up, you'll just keep living

I'm not sitting down 'til I'm older
And I'm not shutting up 'til it's over
Raise your hands and shout if you're with me
Once we start, it won't make a difference

If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, let me hear you
Taking all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living

Every time that I close my eyes,
I catch a glimpse of the west coast sunrise
And I can tell you you're just as beautiful

Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up

Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up

If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, let me hear you
Takin' all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living

Just keep living
