All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout -
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
If you twist like this
'Til the lights go out -
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!

All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
If you twist like this
'Til the lights go out
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!

'Cause lately

Pretty baby
Don't you know I'll treat you right
I'll go crazy
If you pass me up tonight

Hey - Hey - Hey Hey!

Dance the night away
Keep rocking with me
When the grooves alright
Rocking all night
I want to hear you say

The girls in their makeup
In black and white
Exchanging looks tonight
I just ran into some other friends of mine
Someone's coming 'round to pick them up at nine

Hey - Hey - Hey Hey!

Dance the night away
Keep Rocking with me

Dance the night away
