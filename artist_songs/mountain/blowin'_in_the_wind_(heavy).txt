How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea
How many years can people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
Yes, how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
How many times must cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many times must a man look up 
Before he can see the sky
How many ears must one man have
Before he hears people cry
Haw many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
