Don't turn around, I got you under my spell
And never touch a rainbow
Don't fool around, life's so bad down in hell
Can you feel the wind blow

Wild child, you're live for the moment
No heading for tomorrow
You're hell on high heels, this game you can't win
But you still don't know

Backseat Rodeo can't let you go
Romancing Romeo, I don't put on a show

Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Escape from the dream
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Living for the sin
Live for the sin

You're cold as ice and bad to the bones
Just looking for satisfaction
But I am no fool's, oh don't break the rule
Of this strange connection

Moving on and rolling the dice
Our hearts beating like thunder
There's nothing to lose, drinking champaigne on ice
Feeling "Voodoo" down under

Backseat Rodeo can't let you go
Romancing Romeo, I don't put on a show

Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Escape from the dream
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Living for the sin

Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Escape from the dream
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Living for the sin

Backseat Rodeo can't let you go
Romancing Romeo, I don't put on a show

Yeeeah
Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Escape from the dream
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Living for the sin

Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Escape from the dream
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Living for the sin

Don't try to remember
To remember
Voodoo Nights
Voodoo Nights
No time to surrender
Voodoo Nights
Don't try to remember
Voodoo Nights
Yeeeah
