Is this a dream or a fantasy come true
voices in the night,
they are calling me and you
Long way to nowhere,
in the hot desert sand
from far away,
I can see the promised land
Someone whispers
in the darkness of the night
Shadows on the wall,
a flame that's shining bright
In the land of the Giants
In the land of the Giants
Faces in the mirror,
lost and can't escape
Like an animal who's lonely,
Locked up in a cage
riding on the edge, open up the gate
See the world of lost horizons
time is running late
Someone whispers
in the darkness of the night
Shadows on the wall,
a star is shining bright
In the land of the Giants
In the land of the Giants
