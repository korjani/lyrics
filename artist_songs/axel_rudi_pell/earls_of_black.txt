A long time ago (there) was a cloud over heaven
Filled with evil (dragons) and snow
It came from the place where the voices were calling
(And) had a long time to go

Fire and water, the wind and the rain
Silence is filling the air
Blessed by the dark and the master is calling
You better be aware

But the blind leading the blind
(And) any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone
You're on a magical ride

But the blind leading the blind
(And) any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone
You're on a magical ride

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender
Earls of black

Castles and kings, demons with wings
Only the strong will survive
Don't turn your back on the light
The evil's in disguise

Crystal light falling down from the sky
Is there a place where it's burning
Oh they say it's a mystery
No chance of returning

But the blind leading the blind
(And) any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone
You're on a magical ride

But the blind leading the blind
(And) any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone
You're on a magical ride

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender
Earls of black

Woooh-ooh, oooh-oooh
Woooh-ooh, oooh-oooh

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender

Earls of black, flying high
Coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black
And they feel no surrender
No surrender
Earls of black

(Earls of black)
Earls of black
