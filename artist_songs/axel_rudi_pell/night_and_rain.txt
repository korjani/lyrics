On my way and rain was falling down
There were faces in the mirror
Too blind to see they were crying out for me
From the distance (it) gave me shivers

Oh will there be a tomorrow?
I'm losing my mind, full of sorrow

Night and rain
They were calling you
Night and rain
Breaking the spell
Night and rain
Hear they're calling you
Night and rain
Lucifer's opening Hell

We are the innocent
Hunted by the mystic force
The dragonlords are rising from the darkness

Touching your skin
This game we will never win
The unbroken will turned to sadeness

Oh will there be a tomorrow?
I'm losing my mind, full of sorrow

Night and rain
They were calling you
Night and rain
Breaking the spell
Night and rain
Hear they're calling you
Night and rain
Lucifer's opening Hell

Will there be a tomorrow?
I'm losing my mind, full of sorrow

Night and rain
They were calling (you)
Night and rain
Breaking the spell
Night and rain
Hear they're calling (you)
Night and rain
I feel the
Night and rain
Calling you, calling you (there)
Night and rain
Night and rain
Night and rain
I feel the
Night and rain
