You're crossing the line,
running with the devil
You're out of control
I'm begging you please
baby come back to me
don't want to let go
a shot in the air cuts through the night
searching for danger
You're hungry for sin,
you got no chance to win
screaming for vengeance
Scratching my heart,
you're scratching my soul
I still don't know, which way to go

Like a firewall, love came down
Like a firewall, crashing to the ground
Like a firewall, love came down
Like a firewall, silence is the sound

I'm crying for mercy, gimme some more
gonna even the score
wheels are turning, my mind's yearning
I can't take anymore
scratching my heart, scratching my soul

I still don't know, which way I should go
Like a firewall, love came down
Like a firewall, crashing to the ground
Like a firewall, love came down
Like a firewall, silence is the sound

Like a firewall
Like a firewall
