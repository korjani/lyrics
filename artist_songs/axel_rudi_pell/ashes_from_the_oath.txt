Silent night, we saw the rainbow in the sky
Filled with hope, ready to cry
Roaring thunder, and the moon was passing by
Crack in the wall, light in the sky

Early morning, and the strangers sailed away
We don't want another day
We looked for truth, for the reasons of our fate
All reply we got was hate yeiyeah

The black light's calling, and the moon eclipsed the sun
Endless dreams nowhere to run
We tried to get out, we're lost under the gun
In the chance waiting for dawn

Burning candles, the smoke filled up the air
We called the fire, to help us there
Kings and queens, the illusions of our dreams
Surrounded by the fear, that the end is coming near

All we need is the answer (the answer answer)
From the lost world of home (home home home...)
And we pray till the morning
On the ashes from the oath
The ashes from the oath

Early morning, the strangers sailed away
We don't want another day
We looked for truth, for the reasons of our fate
The only reply we got was hate

All we need is the answer (the answer answer)
From the lost world of home (home home home...)
And we pray till the morning
On the ashes from the oath
Yeah
And we search for tomorrow (tomorrow tomorrow)
For our lives and our sins (sins sins sins...)
And our praying still goes on and on
On the ashes from the oath
The ashes from the oath
