I remember that the rain
Falls down
And it was cold in the
Heart of the town,

I'm still searching for the
Meaning of life,
In a world of starry eyes.
I want you back,
Back where you belong,
I never felt love
Growing up so strong.
Can you feel it,
Feel it in your heart
That nothing can
Tear us apart

Your life, your life,
Not close enough to Paradise
Your life, and your
Heart's still cold as ice.

I felt so lonely,
So lonely and cold
With nothing,
Nothing in this world to hold.

I'd tried to stop cryin',
Cryin' all day
All I want is you to stay

Your life, your life,
Not close enough to paradise
Your life, and your
Heart's still cold as ice.

Your life, love is on my mind,
But love's so hard to find
Your life we built
A mountain of love.
High enough to touch
The sky above
