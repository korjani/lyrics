Here I go and make my final stand,
Very far away there's the promised land.
The eagle came down and took me away,
Puts me down in a hole I can't see the light of day.

Oohoh riding on the wings of wonder
Can you feel, the fire from down under

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah

The wizard prays in his unbroken rules
With tears in his eyes for a ship of fools

Then we sailed away and the sun turned black,
We saw the eyes of the lost and we're never comin' back.

Oohoh riding on the wings of wonder
Can you feel, the fire from down under

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah
