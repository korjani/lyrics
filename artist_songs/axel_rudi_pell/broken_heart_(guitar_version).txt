I'm lost in a dream, with a mind's full of sadness,
I remember the good times, that we had in our madness,
Frozen tears with illusions of fire,
All of my life was filled with desire

Oh I wish we could go back to where we started,
Love, lost love, you're so cold, cold hearted,
The fire in your eyes gets me out of my mind,
How could it be, that you're so blind

Hunting the shadow, that was lost in the past
Like a soldier of fortune, who's life couldn't last,
Falling tears, from a love's not in vain
Time tells no lies, could our love come back again

Don't leave me alone
With my broken heart
Can't you see, that I've loved you from the start
Don't leave me alone
With my broken heart
Can't you see, that I've loved you from the start
