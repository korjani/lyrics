Turning out the light, ready for some action
my stick of dynamite, high level satisfaction,
dig your nails in deep, pull the hammer down,
give all your lovin', shake my bones to the ground,

We walk thru the fire, it never causes pain
We're on a high wire, gettin' a little insane

In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of the night, I wanna hear you scream.
In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of night, I wanna hear you scream

Rollin' and tumblin' out the bedroom door,
crazy little sister's cryin' out for more,
take me to the limit, don't bring me back,
can't get enough, it's a love attack

We walk thru the fire, it never causes pain
We're on a high wire, gettin' a little insane

In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of the night, I wanna hear you scream.
In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of night, I wanna hear you scream

We walk thru the fire, it never causes pain
We're on a high wire, gettin' a little insane

In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of the night, I wanna hear you scream.
In the dead of night, I wanna hear you calling me,
calling me
In the dark of night, I wanna hear you scream
