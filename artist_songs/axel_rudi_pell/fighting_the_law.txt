She's only fifteen and she drives you nuts
She's walking down the Lane
and you're going insane
Her eyes like the sun in the sky, oh
they're blinding your heart and your mind

Fighting the law
Fighting the law, you've gotta let go
Fighting the law
Fighting the law, oh no!

She's wild and willing,
but she don't understand
a touch of evil, and it's out of your hands
she shines like the sun in the sky,
oh yeah, she's blinding your heart and your mind

Fighting the law
Fighting the law, you've got to let go
you've got to escape
Fighting the law
Fighting the law oh no!
you're caught in a rage

Fighting the law
Fighting the law, you've got to let go
you've got to escape
Fighting the law
Fighting the law oh no
you're caught in a rage
