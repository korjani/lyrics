Out there in the distance, the lightning strikes the Earth
Full moon is rising, the thunder hits the world
We're so close to the edge of our life
Running high and low, trying to survive
Yeieah
Trying to survive

We're running 'round in circles, to find out of the cave
Another day, and this will be our grave
We heard the tolling, of the backdoor gates of hell
Trying to search, for the key from the spell

The ending is near
There's not enough time, time to survive
We're lost, lost in a world
Building it's own sacrifice
There was no place to hide

Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world

The thunder, the smash, the cracks between the walls
The black moon pyramid once filled with magic, now it's gone
Can we remember, the wizard of eternity
Fighting the evil, break out to be free

The ending is near
There's not enough time, time to survive
We're lost, lost in a world
Building it's own sacrifice
There was no place to hide

Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world
To be free

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, they cry for you and me
Beyond the gates of the seven seals
Beyond the gates, another world
To be free

Another world to be free
Of the seven seals
Oh oh
To be free
Beyond the gates yeah
Ooooh
Yeieh
Oooh
