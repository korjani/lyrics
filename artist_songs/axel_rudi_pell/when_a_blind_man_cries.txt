If you're leaving close the door
I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord you know
There ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room
Had a good time but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord you know
He feels it from his soul
