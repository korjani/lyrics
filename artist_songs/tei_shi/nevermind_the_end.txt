I feel the morning coming over
But if you stay you can leave with me
I'll tell you everything I know
Nowhere left to be

Rain is falling in the corner
Above the boys and the moonlit mask
Just be a shoulder for my head
All I ever ask

Annie left me to the lions
I took a pill and she took my friends
But there is something right with you
Nevermind the end, nevermind the end, nevermind the end

Take me away from here
Somewhere we can just disappear
I'll be your morning light
If you wanna be my ride tonight

Take me away from here
Somewhere we can just disappear
I'll be your morning light
If you wanna be my ride tonight

Rain is falling in the corner
Above the boys and the moonlit mask
Just be a shoulder for my head
All I ever ask, all I ever ask, all I ever ask
