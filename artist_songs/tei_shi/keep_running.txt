Every time I look over my shoulder
I'm getting older
I'm getting older

Every time I look over my shoulder
I'm getting older
I'm getting older

Time is so sad
Tie me to it
Strapped to my side
Never look back

Baby keep running, keep running for me
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
Don't hesitate, don't make me wait
If you want my loving then you better start running

(If you want my loving then you better start running)
(If you want my loving then you better start running)

Every time I look over my shoulder
I'm getting older
I'm getting older

Time is so sad
(Time is sad, time is sad, time is sad, time is sad)
Tie me to it
(Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up)
Strapped to my side
(To my side, to my side, to my side, to my side)
Never look back
(Time is up, time is up, time is up, time is up)

Baby keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running)
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
(If you're chasing things, if you're chasing things)
Baby keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running)
Don't hesitate, don't make me wait
(If you want my loving, if you want my loving)

Baby keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running for me)
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
(If you're chasing things, if you're chasing things)
Baby keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running)
Don't hesitate, don't make me wait
If you want my loving then you better start running
