I'm 'bout to jump in! Splash!

[Chorus:]
I want to take a dip, dip inside your love
Underwater love, never comin' up
I want to take a dip, dip inside your love
Underwater love, never comin' up

[Verse 1:]
I just went down
And never comin' up
I don't need air ba-a-by
Stay here between you ba-a-by
Got my things that I'm gon' need
'Cause I'm gonna stay off in you indeed
'Cause that's just me ba-a-by
'Cause that's just a me ba-a-by

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Now the tide is rollin' in
I'm gonna take a swim
Inside your world ba-a-by (inside the love baby)
Inside your world ba-a-by
Got my safety suit on
Wit' that nothin' can go wrong
Splashing around ba-a-by (all around baby)
I'm gonna stay down here ba-a-by

[Chorus]

[music, woman moaning, bridge:]
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2, woman continues moaning:]
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo

[music fades out with bridge, water bubbling]
