[Big Boi:]
5 O'clock 
But I Stopped @ 4:59 
Twist A Jay Of Some Hay 
Got A Call From Sleepy Brown (Brown)

Say Its Going Down (Down) 
Town, At The Lounge 
Defintley Crowed With The Happy Hour Crowd 
Drinks For A Dollar 
Everybody's Buzzin, Cuzzin 
Spittin Like A Major Leauge Pitcher 
Tryna Cut Somethang 
Only Throwin Balls No Strikes For Tonight 
So Walk Up To Tha Chevy For Some Heavy Thinkin 
Lets Ride 
To My Underground Bungalow 
Uproach The Mounds 
Baby I'm Tha Head Coach Now 
Wow! Baby Need A Wet Cold Towel 
Pharrel's On Tha Way So Stay And Play Awhile 
(Sleepy Brown) 
(For Real, Big Boy) 

[Chorus: Pharrel]
I've Been Workin All Day 
Now I'm Done So See Ya 
It's Time For Play 
Name The Place, I'll Meet Ya 
We Can Do Tha Bar 
Sip Margarita's 
Stay On Tha Floor 
Go With Me 4 A Ride 
Aren't You Feelin Nice? 
Doesn't It Feel Nice? 
Is Everybody High? 

[Sleepy Brown:]
Oh Baby, Do You Think That 
Sittin In The Bar With What You Hangin 
I Wonder If You Kno I'm Watchin You 
Cuz Everythang You Do Is So Bea-Ti-Ful 
Oh, The Way U Run Your Finger (Over That Glass) 
Oh, The Way You Look Over Your Shoulders (When You Dance) 
I'm Tryna Get The Nerve To Talk To You 
So Maybe We Can Find Sum Place To Go 

[Chorus: Pharrel]
I've Been Workin All Day 
Now I'm Done See Ya 
It's Time For Play

Aren't You Feelin Nice? 
Doesn't It Feel Nice?

Staring In Your Eyes Tryna Read Your Mind 
Don't You Realize
