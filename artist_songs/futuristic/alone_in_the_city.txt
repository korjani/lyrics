Late nights on the beach just walkin', late nights on the beat just talkin'
Late night drunk dials to my bro back in Illinois, we don't really speak too often
Late nights in the sheets just tossin', late nights I don't sleep, exhausted
Early mornings when I drink my coffee, everybody still asleep, creep softly
Long drives with my favorite homies, I'm surrounded but still feel lonely
Meet and greets after all of my shows, B, everybody feel like they know me
Afternoon in my new whip cruisin', stars on the street feel illusive
Big subs in the back, they boomin', I only listen to my new shit
My drawer full of condoms, I don't use 'em, well, that's stupid, all my relationships is abusive
Tell 'em the truth but yet they're still clueless, I wonder what the fuck am I doin'
Nice guy I never been ruthless, but I'll wear that if the shoe fits
Cause I got six girls that love me, but I only love my music

Late nights, bright lights, long drives, in my zone
Fast life, bad type, smash twice, gotta go
All alone, in my home
All alone, in the city
Late nights, bright lights, long drives, in my zone
Fast life, bad type, smash twice, gotta go
All alone, in my home
All alone

Short days go by when I'm with you, remember when I used to write with a pencil?
Everybody think they got the game figured out, well, I came here to break that stencil
Sometimes you just can't be gentle, I been eatin' with my hands, no utensils
I got a big fam and they all crazy like Kim Ks, I be tryna stay up out the way like Kendall
Walk up in the club with credentials, I pour the bottle in my cup, take it straight to the mental
Used to fuck Crystal, got me sentimental, used to lay in bed and discuss all these issues
Way back when I used to kiss you, you were leavin' and I would already miss you
All that make up on your face doesn't make you fake, when girls hate, I would never let 'em diss you
Lost you but I didn't trip, I always knew I'd have you again
I always knew that a girl couldn't change my world the same way that I could with a fuckin' pen
I think this song needs violins, I think this song needs violence
I think I'm a murderer, every song I just been bodyin', someone go find me a place that I can go and hide 'em in

Late nights, bright lights, long drives, in my zone
Fast life, bad type, smash twice, gotta go
All alone, in my home
All alone, in the city
Late nights, bright lights, long drives, in my zone
Fast life, bad type, smash twice, gotta go
All alone, in my home
All alone, in the city
