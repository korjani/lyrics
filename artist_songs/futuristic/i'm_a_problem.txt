[Futuristic:]
Yeah!
Stop that, any show, I betta rock that
When I drop that, Everybody finna' cop that
Nigga pop that, gettin' brain like a tophat
Ahead of my time, somebody rewind the clock back
And your boy keep goin', flex on a hater like my name Hulk Hogan
Scared em, Fear Factor, Joe Rogan
You sing to a nigga like yo name Frank Ocean
"Oh shit, did he just say that? Let me replay that
Yup, he did, I'm way mad
This the type of shit that really make me hate rap"
Calm the fuck down, ASAP
I'm Futuristic, You recordin' on an 8-track
And I got flow like I been rockin' a wave cap
Pop up in the maybach, Put on the face mask
Let the AK (CLAP) Blow off ya name tag (haa)
That's typical shit, but me ain't no typical kid
I got a typical chick, in a typical whip, but I promise baby girl this ain't no typical dick
I'm lyrically sick, mentally blessed, physically I'm pretty legit
And I told this chick to dip like a chip, her nigga ain't say shit like a typical bitch
I'm the biggest problem you can't solve it, math equation
I'm the future I see the future like That's So Raven
I'm goin' hard just like a boner but no masturbation
I'm spittin' on all of these hoes, ejaculation

[Hook:]
Houston we have a problem
Houston we have a problem
Houston we have a problem
I'm a problem, Can't nobody stop em! [x2]

[K.I.D:]
K.I.D too real nigga, bars artist, still nigga
Your songs don't hit at all, you spit shit I don't feel nigga
You walk like you wear heels nigga, you thought you gonna pass fo me
Spit flames like propane, you thought you goin' gas me?
Never that cause I'm never wack, Nigga I don't stop till the song done
Tell these guys to keep the hoes I'm the type of nigga they mom want
Your dad thinks I'm a great guy because I call him mister
So when I'm done with your mom, he wants me to date your sister (Wow)
Pow! Right in the kisser, Runnin' shit so long that I got blisters
This is my world because I'm a star, I'm solely sorry you not on my system dog
Oh you do this super duper, can't keep up, you's a loser
You could have a moped, you could have a boat, you could have a bike, you could have a scooter
You could have Steve Jobs build a computer
Nigga I'm a problem and you can't solve it
Calculators, hours later, and all you niggas is gettin' it wrong
It's not your fault you're hella dumb, Bein' this real is hella fun, Yeah
Me and Futuristic, fuck your heart, show me statistics dog

[Hook]

[SK4MC:]
Start that, I'm a show you where the heart at
Doin' this a lifetime, show you where my art at
Pull my dick out, yo momma had a heart attack
Leave the mic, fishing rod, now it's just an artifact
You're official like NFL replacement referees
I was bigger than your daddy, actually when I was 17
Out in Vegas, with your momma, and her recipe
For destiny, Destruction, and a thousand hits of Ketamine
Kyle the Problem, Futuristic the Problem, SK4MC the Problem Bitchh
(Can't nobody stop em!)
On the porch, like a pimp and shit
Never used crutches but I gotta limp and shit
I heard y'all niggas want beef, well tonight I fixed up shrimp and shit
It's imminent that your feminine, and your pockets make a synonym
For a dinner made of Mickey D's and a king-sized bag of M&Ms
I'm the- I'm the biggest problem fuck your life, eat jerky bacon
In the- In the future I gave you sutures hospital patient
If you're trying to solve it, you must have little patience
Kyle, Futuristic, SK on the track (This time you're wastin')
