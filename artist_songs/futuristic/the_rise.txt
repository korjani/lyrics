[Intro - Devvon Terrell:]
Said I'd never get it, that's a motherfucking lie
In my way, get away from my motherfucking rise

[Hook x2 - Devvon Terrell:]
Said I'd never get it, that's a motherfucking lie
See me 'bout to rise, no one can tell me...
In my way, get away, from my motherfucking rise
You see me coming up and no one can tell me "no"

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Yo, yo, failure's never fade, we still at it climbing
Perfect timing, my rhyming so sick could make them vomit
I mean these lines just like movies, you hear it multiple times
And gotta rewind it to find what the fuck he's tryna remind you
Is there a message or something deeper inside it
Maybe he spitting simple and hopes that you can recite it
I'm grinding, no nine to five, I'm working eyelid to eyelid
Now that's open to close, I travel more than a pilot
I been at it, been an addict since I discovered this rapping
I subtracted any wack shit then put it out to the masses
I been snapping, got the tracks to make the kids jump on they mattress
And wanna act just like Zach, they got sauce on all they snappers
I'm tired of moving backwards, it's time that I got it cracking
A picture is worth a thousand words so I don't need a caption
WTF Gang, I'm the captain
They said, I'd never do it, then I made it happen

[Hook x2 - Devvon Terrell]

[Bridge - Devvon Terrell:]
Young, real nigga in the making (in the making)
Love me and I know you gon' hate it (gon' hate it)
Moving up, a nigga steady pacing
I don't really know just why niggas hating
Cause everything you see is on me, on me
And I never tell a lie, if it's really on me, on me
Young nigga independent
I don't like nobody in my fucking buisness

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
Yo, nobody telling me "no", I did this shit on my own
Working since I was a kid, holy shit, now I'm grown
Put me in the rolling stones
Boy, I done travled the globe, get a mic, killing shows, I can't wait to get back on the road
The life that I chose, don't know how to act when I'm home
People won't leave me alone, they all with me now
Where the fuck was you then? When I was trying to be heard
I been putting it down
I roll with the squad, the one's who belived in me first
We running the town
Every rapper around is begging your boy for a verse everytime that I'm out
I'm acting like Drake cause my behavior is the worst
My bandwagon is been full, I'm popping out, that's Crisco
That girl used to act like a bitch, now I give her dick
No lip though, I don't kiss hoes, that shit's gross
My hits go and they know that
Now every moment is a memory
They want pictures now, that's Kodak
I don't hold back, I'm all-in
My team building on small wins
I'm a stand-up guy so why would I tryna help a nigga tryna crawl in
I see it on they face, they look surprised
They want a slice of the pie, but wasn't with me for the rise
