[Hook:]
I be that nigga who shut down the city
I be that nigga drunk as fuck with all my people with me
I be that nigga with alot of groupies
Hella famous, signing autographs on bitches boobies
I be that [x16]

[Verse 1:]
I'm the only one doing what I'm doing, these rappers is all pursuing, Futuristic really did it
Young nigga with a grind so tough can't nobody tell me nothing cause I'm in to the finish
Dropping more records than the guiness, got them skittish niggas sick, I need to take them to the clinic
A couple bitches got me looking like I'm winning, at the studio, I tell them that I'm leaving in a minute
I be that, they know how I does it, these hoes hoping they get invited
She test me all day and I don't say a thing, I send her the address and she getting excited
You can bring friends to the party, they gotta be naughty, my darling is private
Four shots of liqour, enjoying the mali, they all getting naked and showing they privates
I be that, this a sauce man, WTF gang
If you hating, I can make you dissapear, like David Blaine
Five bad bitches in my whip, I don't know them by name, I call them Danity Kane
I'm getting young money, like a nigga chilling with Wayne
I bring the heat, like I'm chilling with Wade, cause I be that

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I kinda got it popping, homie, quitting's not an option
And I'm killing all these rappers, pull up yellow tape caution
And these niggas selling out, like paintings at an auction
It ain't over 'til the fat lady singing, this the opera
I was born to ball, I know you saw
That a young dude got the juice like oranges, dog
You say you the best but you know you wrong
[?]
Cole world like J. Cole, y'all bootleg like faygo
My shows look like day glow
I need a chick that move her hips, like J-Lo
Sitting 'til I can't stand up, shine so bright I might tan ya
Who they favorite rapper, they picking me like a teacher
I'm a student who should put they hand up
And I ain't never had a hand out
Even when I'm sitting down, boy, I stand out
Feel clean like I washed it with ShamWow
I be that crowd surfing nigga on my fans, ah

[Hook]
