[Verse:]
Yeah, yo, my grandmama passed away a month ago
I swear to God that I will never be the same
I don't even know why I'm swearing to God
I don't really believe in all of that bullshit anyways
I'm sorry if you get offended
Back in the day, I used to be the same
I went to church every weekend all by myself
But I kinda feel like the preacher is to blame
He took advantage of my bro
That's a story that no one knows
Shouldn't be told so I keep it to myself
I wanna ask him about it but I just leave it alone
And I don't tell stories for the fuck of it
I do it just to get it off my chest
I don't know how to do anything but rap
I ain't learned shit since the day my dad left
And I cry sometimes when we talk on the phone
He don't know that's a hole that was never filled
A patch on my heart and my brain
I will never be the same
That's a wound that'll never heal
A clubhouse that we never built
Then again, we still got good memories
At least I can thank him for the fact that he went to the clinic to tell my mama not to get rid of me
It was that damn close
So I guess I'm supposed to be alive
So is it strange if I hope that I die?
Hope that I swerve off the road late at night?
Hope that I crash when I'm taking a flight?
Hope that he pulls out a gun if we fight?
I don't give a fuck, nigga, that's all my life
That sound stupid, right?
But that's a thought that I think all the time
I often wish I could rewind
Both my ex-girls got kids
One month away from being mine
It shows how they get over a nigga
Both of them broke and they call me to complain
And both of them cheated
I guess that's why I feel like all women is the same
I cheated on my next girl too
I fucked a whole bunch of girls
But honestly none of them meant shit
I did it just to get over you
Ain't that what we supposed to do?
Come on, I'm a man, I'm a dog
And you so in love with a nigga, you forgive him and act like you ain't see what you saw
I don't smoke that much, it make me paranoid
I don't drink that much, it make me wanna fight
My best friend stole all of my shit
And got away with it like he does every time
I should have beat his ass, right?
But he lied and he said it wasn't him
He even cried and gave me a big hug
So I guess that our whole friendship was pretend
If I'm rambling, turn me off, if you care at all, turn it up
The only thing that I ever wanted was for people to hear my music, put it in the car and bump
Nah, that ain't enough
I wanna be known as the greatest
World famous, still the most hated
Most underrated but most overplayed shit

[Outro x2:]
So listen to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen to me
Oh, even if I'm off key, listen to me
Why don't you listen to me?
Yeah, listen to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen to me
Oh, even if I'm off key, listen to me
Why don't you listen to me?
