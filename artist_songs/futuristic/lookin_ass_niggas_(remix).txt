[Intro - Futuristic:]
Uh, and you tryna run when I put you in that position, all I know, is, you a, looking ass bitch anyway, shit, I don't give a fuck, what up y'all, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Look at these looking ass bitches
Gold digging, tryna catch a nigga slipping
Talking 'bout I can't handle the pussy
But then tryna run when I put you in that position
Unbelievible ass bitches
Swetty titties in the club, but you can't dance
Oh, Rack City, Tyga, YG, Sage The Gemini, Ty Dolla $ign, [?]
Looking ass, you the type to take a selfie of your face with a little bit of the cleavage
Low key, but love to bust, girl, you dusty as fuck, you a slut, God damn, you need Jesus (pray for these hoes)
These all lying ass bitches, house wife, catfish frying ass bitches
Need a diet ass bitches, miss independent, girl you tripping I know you live with your mama these trifling ass bitches
Let me talk about these white girls, drunk every night girls, never wanna fight girls
Them best friend every other day matching tattoo's on your thigh young ass spy girls (spy kids)
Ho spoiled ass, never be royals ass, left over take the grilled chicken out the foil ass
Face Boyle ass, [?] bitch, you look like a Oompa Loompa, you a old ass bitch
Whole team I'm watching ass, put a leash on yo kids
[?], you fucking every nigga you meeting, everyone of his friends
Old yoga pants wearing ass acting like you ain't up in the gym and begging for attention
You might look cute on Instagram, met your ass in person, God damn, you look different

[Verse 2 - Devvon Terrell:]
[?] touch down from the B to the small town
Everywhere I go I see these looking ass bitches
Looking, looking at the ten light, who that? I'm your way too fool that
