Independent lil nigga with a vision
Everybody thought that I was tripping, they finally get it, huh?
I been addicted to ripping these writtens
Spitting and flipping these kittens bitches throwing pussy at the kid, huh?
This is mindcraft, I'm on the right path
My mic can't be flammable, I'm blaze, homie, I might blast
When the time pass and a bypass for the white trash from these tight raps
They telling me that they nizak
If you spit a rhyme then I might laugh
Oh God!
Welcome to the internet
Where everybody only comment leaving disrespect
Where everybody got a hobby but don't get a check
Where everybody tryna clown me but I been the best
Where everybody dropped out of college, forget the test
Where everybody get knowledge but never been correct
Where everybody would sit in up in the lobby
And watch me rap all cocky in Compton but now I'm in the flesh
(Move, bitch!)
Created a culture now we taking over and no one can stop us (Move, bitch!)
They go on the internet, pull out their phones up in class, get distracted and watch us
(Move, bitch!)
They check on the computer screens, viewing one after another, another gon' pop up
(Views, bitch!)
I did this shit on my own, I sold more albums than dudes on a label so drop 'em
These niggas keep rapping with the same flow
Lameos are stuck, they need Drano
I see four models, four bottles
One mic, need all of the above like Maino
And now I get girls wet, I need a raincoat
My voice sore from rapping, it's like I chain smoke
And you release the beast trying to eat
Like a borders in the yard that was crazy until the chain broke
With my squad, no squid
That's Mogul I'm Rob and he Big
I'm bout to blow like a toy near Sid, nigga
You look just like one of those zombie pigs
Your chick on my stick like a witch
I am not flipping no bricks but I'm getting rich
They cannot catch me: silverfish
Inside my mind where I crafted these hits

My mind been on overdrive, I don't know if I can still take it
My head going round and round and don't know if I can still make it
They telling me that I'm famous and that's all good but that might pass
Somebody give me that mic back cause I'm in the lab and I might snap with this mindcraft

I might snap with this mindcraft
(As seen on the internet
As seen on the internet)
I might snap with this mindcraft
(As seen on the internet
As seen on the internet)
I might snap with this mindcraft
(As seen on the internet
As seen on the internet)
I might snap with this mindcraft
(As seen on the internet)

Independent lil nigga with a vision
