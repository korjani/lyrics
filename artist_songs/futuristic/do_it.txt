Yeah, growin' up everybody said I wouldn't be shit
Had a lotta goals, they told me I'd never reach 'em
Who wants to be a millionaire? I'm feelin' like Regis
Women on their knees for the kid like I'm Jesus
Jesus, I be in her stomach like a fetus
Rappers tryna give me L's but I'm undefeated
My teachers told me I should listen to their speeches
Now I come back to the city and fill the bleachers
Believe me, I been doin' everything I planned
I ain't talkin' candy bars but I say it's a hundred grand
Multiply that shit by six and that's what I got in my hand
Take a pic for Instagram, I don't think they understand

I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup, got 'em singin' like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Yeah, I feel like I been on my shit for like a hundred thousand days
I could take a verse and flip it in a hundred thousand ways
If I post that on my Twitter, that's a hundred thousand plays
Everybody tryna copy, that's a hundred thousand lames
Yo, I don't fuck with you, that's clear
Tell me where were you? Last year
Back when I was tryin' to get it but now I got it
More people in your face, with more faces in your wallet
I be steady workin', always chasin' after paper
Tryna stack it high up, higher than a skyscraper
I'm on another level, you should catch an elevator
If you talkin', I'm a serve you, boy, I'm something like a waiter

I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup
I do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, yup, got 'em singin' like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, do it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Yeah, I got a white girl and she move it like Lexy
If twerkin' was a sport, she would probably win an Espy
And I get her wet like the bottom of a jet ski
A nigga might explode when she shake it like a Pepsi
Let's see, I just tell her, "Do it for the Vine"
Oh, you ain't gon' do it? Why you even waste my time?
I know that you gon' do it, I say, "Why the fuck you lyin'?"
Why the fuck you lyin'? Why the fuck you lyin'?
Stop fuckin' lyin'

[Futuristic (Lexy Panterra):]
(Damn, why does everyone expect me to twerk for them all the time?)
Hmm, I don't know, cause your booty fat and you always twerkin' on YouTube
(You work at Subway, does that mean you should make me a sandwich right now? No, anyways, I'm a singer, I have been since... forever)
If you can really sing, sing something right now
(Oh God, aight) Everybody shut the fuck up!
(Let's get in started in here yeah, bitch)
Damn! Aight, now twerk
