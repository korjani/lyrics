[Verse 1 - Futuristic:]
Writin' verses, re-word 'em until they're perfect
I'm certain that I should make it, but will I? It got me nervous
Feel like this my purpose and everybody heard it
They would see that I'm that person who's workin' and I deserve it
If only they could see me through my mama's eyes
I apologize, I quit college, she's disappointed but not surprised
I ain't got no time for these niggas that I grew up with
They smokin' and they drinkin' with women I used to fuck with
I've been enough shit, all I do is spit raps
Scrapped over diss tracks, killed niggas at kickbacks
At the party at Mill Ave. and everybody know it's me
Hope that I can make it without a hater approachin' me
My team is gettin' smaller, I keep my circle tight
And got these women fallin' like leaves do in Autumn
My niggas don't understand me, my fans be goin' the hardest
I just keep to myself, and keep focused on my target
Ahh!

[Hook - Futuristic:]
Yeah, I gave my all from the start
I'm workin' hard, I'm workin' long
I play my part, I'm workin' smart
I'm on my own, feel all alone
I had no home, I need a clone, and all my people gone
Long days, cold nights
Long days, cold nights
Long days, cold nights
Long days, cold nights

[Verse 2 - SwizZz:]
Look
Jealousy is creepin', I can sense it from afar
Ain't nothin new to me, I've blanketed too many scars
Homies that chose another route, now wanna get involved
But who would you depend on if tomorrow it all fell apart?
Cold days, long nights, feelin' under-appreciated but that is all right
I'm forced to turn my back, and lift my head
A couple of tears had to be shed
My past is fuckin' up vision so it's hard to look ahead
I gotta keep focused, false motives
Pushin' me to abandon niggas that I used to roll with
We used to be the closest, I love you like my brother
But your girl fucked up your head and carved out your true colors
I stuck with an empty bottle and kush that got me trippin'
I adapted to the bullshit niggas do, now I'm indifferent
Fuck sittin' and wishin' and it will not help me out
Because it is what it is, even when it's hard to smile
Z's up

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Futuristic:]
Yo, okay that show last night was crazy, these ladies wanna have my baby
I told my pops that I wouldn't ever let no pussy phase me
But damn she look like Beyonce and my flow is strong as Jay-Z
But without that would she want me or even want to date me? Huh?
Fuck her and leave her, guess I don't need her
Hear her voice in my head, she only hear mine through the speakers
And I teach her to cope with it
I'm on the road with the snow hittin' the windshield, damn it's a cold winter
Radio interviews used to seem huge, now it's miniscule, addressin' the reasons I get ridiculed
"Futuristic rap like every nigga that you listen to, not original dude"
Shut the fuck up, I ain't in the mood
Wish I could call my grandmother and tell her I love her
I miss her fallin' asleep while that dinner was in the oven
I miss prankin' my brother, I wanna hug him
I wanna send him something, accomplish so much
But it feel like nothing, nah

[Hook]
