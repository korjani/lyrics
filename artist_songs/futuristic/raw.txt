[Verse 1 - Samson:]
Nah, I don't regret it, everybody's fucking with it
Thank you if you meant it even if you are a critic
Just another minute, let me roll another spliff and
We could light it up and then get lifted
Tell me what you know, could you hear me out?
Cause in a minute, I be full of doubt
Stuck in the cold, in the snow, with some fifties out
Just tryna buy another day, am I tripping out?
Whoa now, slow down, this is what I found, this is what it is
This is life, this is for the kids
Just got a gun to the mouth of the motherfucker
No shots fired, I say one recovered
Rolling in the dark for a minute, let me talk for a minute
Let me walk outside and we spark for a minute, wait
I stop for a minute
Lost for a minute, my God, this is gonna sound raw
This is gonna sound raw
This is gonna sound raw

[Verse 2 - Futuristic:]
My flow is raw just like these papers that they send me every month
Raw like how I go in on that chick I always wanted to fuck
If I speak the truth too much, wait, there's no such thing, truth is us
The youth is up, I flew, I jumped, don't drive me, dog, I'm super pumped
I get lost when the bass hit, got lost in the basement, I was making great hits
I don't believe in outer space shit
But my big bro said that he was taking on a spaceship and he ain't been the same since
That's weird to me
Like when a stranger comes and they say they hearing me
Or when I'm driving and I hear my beat
In a car, pulled up tryna clear the streets
Clearly he just fears defeat
Speaking of third person, clearly me, the kid's a beast, grit your teeth
Shit he speaks is too real, I have suicidal kids, that'll save their life
Let that soak in, suicidal kids, that'll save their life
Hit me up, I'll reply
Don't cry, everything's alright
In all honesty, you saved mine, so thank you
And I don't smoke that much, but how can I not when my songs suggest it?
How can I not talk to fans when they got a lotta questions and I gotta address it?
How can I not change my ways? You would think I learned a lesson the second I got arrested
How can I not believe in God, when I'm still alive? Treating everyday like a blessing, I'm raw
And that's all, tryna stray from my past flaws
I used to be a man that I couldn't stand
And place blame, say that it was my dad's fault
So damn wrong and I know now
How it goes down, I can't slow down
I get fucked up in my home town
And they so proud so I showed out
And if my shows ain't sold out
Then I fell of, cause they used to be
Truthfully, my last album wasn't that good
But this time, I abuse the beats
White fans understand but I lose the streets
It's all good, man, life's a beach
I write my piece, then I say peace
Remember me...
