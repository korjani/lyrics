[Intro:]
Yo, yo, this the last motherfucking one take y'all get 'til the album come out, in March or April or May or somewhere down the road, nigga, I'm sorry for the wait two

[Verse:]
The game getting crowded, you should help out
If you know you trash, you should take yourself out
I got these rappers all scared of Futuristic
Like a kid who got in trouble and mama just took the belt out
I'm getting better, it's apparent, now they know me
They be staring, my style, they all inherit
They see me doing my thing on the stage and they get embaresed
Like a kid who's on a field trip with both his weird parents
Haters better duck and cover
I'm Mortal Kombat with the verses, every cut is upper
I'm your favorite rapper that have yet to discover
And all I do is make hits, I'm a fucking slugger
Saucy give me credit, I write it, but never edit
I spit it, never forget it
My money is in a wad, it look like a head of lettuce
If you nice and wanna battle, I murder him, he's in heaven
Get it? Nice guys go to heaven
I'm gassing every track, I'm mixing vodka with unleaded
On a scale from one to ten, okay, my girl is like a seven
But I love her and all my side hoes is eleven (sheesh)
That's my only pair of retro's, wearing when I wreck hoes
You still rocking Ecko
Please, tell me that's not where your whole check go
I been making money, rocking shows like Tiësto
Pesto and grilled chicken
Quinoa and veggies will make you feel different
I found out that good looks could be my meal ticket
Now they face green with envy like the dude who stole Christmas
Still gifted, can't nobody take it from me
And all I do is rap, I could make a mummy
And these niggas is bitches, they could make a puppy
I'm getting brain from a college bitch that hate to study
I came in the game, didn't know what I wanted
Just know that I hated these rappers that fronted
But they always saying, they keep it a hundred
Promise that shit made me sick to my stomach
I rise to the top and I'm not gonna plummet
Spit fire like dragon, welcome to the dungeon
Shitting on niggas I might need a plunger
I just can't deal with they need disrespect
I'm usually nice, but if you wanna fight
Then I'm stabbing you twice and then breaking your neck
When they play my song, you should all sing along
And start banging your head or I'm banging your head on the wall
'Til you fall, if you wanna survive, then just do what I say

[Outro:]
I'm sorry for the wait two, I'm sorry for the wait two (hehe, yeah)
I'm sorry for the wait two, I'm sorry for the wait two
(I'm 'bout to go on tour, bitch)
I'm sorry for the wait two, I'm sorry for the wait two
(My album dropping and it's called The Rise, motherfucker)
I'm sorry for the wait two, I'm sorry for the wait two, sheesh
