Goddamn, your face, so perfect but not plastic
There ain't not one bump on it, you must've used Proactive
Your lips is extra smooth, I wanna taste your chapstick
Your booty juicy too, you look like you do gymnastics
I wanna walk with you, where you goin'? I wanna talk with you, what you thinkin'?
Maybe I could be your Will Smith and, you could be my Jada Pinkett
Your bath water, I would drink it, wait, that's weird, I didn't mean it
I just wanna see you laugh, forget your past, and give you something with meanin'
The way you lookin' in that sundress, it really wanna make me undress you, you know?
Not gonna lie, I'm into rough sex, is that too much? Oh wait, you too?
I kinda figured you would dig that, where your kids at? You ain't got none? Yes, I don't get that
We're too young to be gettin' trapped, I'm tryna travel the world, now tell me, baby, is you with that?
Cause I don't got no plans today, and you ain't got no plans today, so let's do something
And I'm gettin' kinda hungry too, so I'm a get some food, oh yeah, you comin'
I like the way you move, I'm an outcast, I'm not ashamed to say it, I shout it out fast
I can't lie though, I really wanna see you in your birthday suit, tell me, baby, is you 'bout that?

[Devvon Terrell:]
Baby, you stay on my mind
We textin', sextin', we progressin'
Oh yeah, need you all the time
So show me, show me, show me
Show me them nudes
Show me all you
Don't mind if I do, yeah
Break a nigga off with a pic right quick
Only if it's true
Show me all you
I wanna see you, baby
I might just have to save it
Send me them nudes

[Futuristic:]
Yeah, so when I'm gone, I'm a need your pictures to my phone, got me in my thoughts, can't wait 'til I get home
You ain't gotta worry, I swear I'm all alone, look, I'm by myself, nobody would know
In my zone when I'm out here, and then I come back home, they know I'm out here
And everything that I'm doin' don't seem right if you ain't with me and I know that it sound weird
But can you make that pose that I like, baby, can you make that face that I love
Make a nigga wanna go crazy, if you fall and then you know I'm a catch you like a glove
No scrubs like TLC, we don't need ID, we in the club, all drinks on me, know how it be
When you feel just like Ali, at twenty-three you can ball when you on my team, even overseas like damn
Send me a pic, I might drop everything and say I'm on my way
I'm tryna get in that thing that's right below your waist and in between your legs
I'll know that you'll never say, no, I just wanna keep that thing close
Send me a pic, I'm a judge that like I'm on a jury it's 'bout to be cased closed

[Devvon Terrell:]
Baby, you stay on my mind
We textin', sextin', we progressin'
Oh yeah, need you all the time
So show me, show me, show me
Show me them nudes
Show me all you
Don't mind if I do, yeah
Break a nigga off with a pic right quick
Only if it's true

Send me them nudes
Send me them nudes
Send me them nudes
Break a nigga off with a pic right quick
Only if it's true
Show me all you
I wanna see you, baby
I might just have to save it
Send me them nudes
