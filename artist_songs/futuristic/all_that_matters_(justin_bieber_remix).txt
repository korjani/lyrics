[Intro:]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse:]
Yo, I think about you when I wake up
The last thang on my mind 'fore I go to sleep
You heard my song, said, "it was pretty deep"
Next thing we know, we under covers and I'm pretty deep
God damn
I got the type of shit that make you weak
After we finish, you can barely speak, catch your breath
I bent you over the kitchen sink
I wrote this song as soon as you left
But it ain't about the sex though
It's a feeling I can't let go
A lot of letters you always end with an "xo"
A lot of fights, we a mess though
Screaming 'til my throat hurts like a nigga got strep throat
You the best at calming a nigga down
I feel lost when you're not around
I need a text or a call, I'm obsessed, I'm meant all
You the best that I saw, keep me on the ground
You feel lost in a shuffle, music is my hustle
I do it for the both of us so we ain't gotta struggle
You should know by now, I never put nothing above you
So now you better wear that dress I like you in or you in trouble
Matter fact, you in trouble either way
Pass the love, baby, lead the way
I fly you to the show tonight, you leave today
I think you already know what I don't need to say
You're all that matters to me

[Outro:]
Yeah, yeah, there ain't no "I" in team
I need you to believe that you're all that matters to me
You're all that matters to me and I don't even sing
But I'm singing for you, tryna get you in sheets and do things to you
What you think? We ain't leaving the room for a week or two

Or I'm a fuck your mom and your little sister, nigga
Yeah and I'm a tell her, you're all that matters to me, yeah
