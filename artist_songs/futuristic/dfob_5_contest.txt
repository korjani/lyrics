[Intro:]
Yeah... y'all know who the fuck I be
"Game please don't sign Futuristic
He sounds like Drake going through puberty!"
Shut up, I'm 'bout to one-take this shit
Look

[Verse - Futuristic:]
The only time I feel fly is when I stage dive
Murdering these rappers then going to court for hate crimes
Before you see me on the news via Dateline
I'm watchin' ya girlfriend, finger fuck herself through FaceTime
I'm that average rapper posted on they channel
Spittin' like a camel, flyin' off the handle on these hatin' kids
I'm a make a foundation for you fakers; yo life I'm 'bout to take it
But before that - you should 'Make a Wish'
Wishful thinkin' no 'Mercy' like I'm with G.O.O.D. Music
Makin' good music, makin' y'all look stupid!
I got ya girlfriend naked like Roofus
Mole rat, ya flow's wack, Mr. I Had To Do It
Talkin' ruthless through computers, makin' a big illusion
Sayin' things but you don't do 'em
I'm just askin' you to prove it
I'm askin' you faggot dudes, to rap like you have a clue
Before I have to 'Act a Fool', somethin' like Luda
Goddamn that boy's sick, undefeated like Floyd's fists
Injected I'm hittin' 'em all with roid kicks
This ain't a game but yo main thing on my joystick
Please do not harass me I snap and I get annoyed quick
That boy rich, not at all, but I'm about to be
Mitch and house-woman party for people that doubted me
Take 'em to the top floor, and throw 'em off the balcony
Lookin' hella sharp like a motherfuckin' falcon's feet
Damn, I shoulda been on the original
'Don't Mind If I Do' had y'all thinkin' my skills was minimal
'Chasing Down a Dream' just dropped so you should go and get a few
After they hear my shit I bet they be on my genitals
Been ridiculed for sounding gay
Your bars are hardly straight you party lame
Mixed with mediocre in a garbage way
After-party I'm pourin' a barbie Chardonnay
Take yo girlfriend to the alley like it's garbage day
I'm actin' like I already made it
But the fact is I ain't done shit, and I'm madly underrated
Niggas hatin' ain't no debatin' every track I be slayin'
All my moves is calculated like I'm playin' Operation
This conversation from me to you - I quit school to chase my dreams
I told my mom I would achieve and I'm a see 'em through
So I don't speak on things that you ain't never seen me do
So every line I drop in every song you best believe is true...

[Outro:]
Beat it in the head 'til the flow sick FV
WTF Gang, uh, and uh
Put this on your iPod or CD-ROM
