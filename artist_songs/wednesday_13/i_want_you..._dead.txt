Goddamn here we go, off to the graveyard, go, go, go
Give 'em to me decayed, give 'em to me anyway
I don't care 'cause you know I only want you

Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you
Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you

Crawling from your grave, calling out my name
Begging for my brains saying, hey, hey, hey
I want you to take my hand and tell me I'm your man
And I only want you dead

Hey ho, let's go to hell, I've got a room reserved
And I'll see you there, make me die slowly, butcher me and hold me
I don't care 'cause you know I only want you

Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you
Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you

Crawling from your grave, calling out my name
Begging for my brains saying, hey, hey, hey
I want you to take my hand and tell me I'm your man
And I only want you dead

Fuck yeah, it's understood, necro-feelin' great, necro-feelin' good
Give 'em to me decayed, give 'em to me anyway
I don't care 'cause you know I only want you

Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you
Dead, dead, dead
You know I want you

Crawling from your grave, calling out my name
Begging for my brains saying, hey, hey, hey
I want you to take my hand and tell me I'm your man
And I only want you dead
