Gather round closely, don't be scared
And listen to the stories of the undead
I hang on every word you said
Now I'm shaking and shivering, pull the covers over my head

Baby, tell me all your ghost stories
Tell us how they grieve and haunt the night
Hold me tight and tell me all your stories
Sing along in this haunted lullaby

All the things you fear about the night
I'll count the minutes until the morning light
And you tell us it will be alright
If we don't get taken away by the creatures of the night

Baby, tell me all your ghost stories
Tell us how they grieve and haunt the night
Hold me tight and tell me all your stories
Sing along in this haunted lullaby

Baby, tell me all your ghost stories
Tell us how they grieve and haunt the night
Hold me tight and tell me all your stories
Sing along in this haunted lullaby
