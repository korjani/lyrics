I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery
Ghouls and creeps fucking gather 'round
For the evil that's going down
Get down!

Blood in the cradle, guess your baby's dead
The boogie man came and chopped off its head
Knots in the noose, baby duck, duck, goose
White knuckle paranoia, the stitches coming loose

Now you scream in horror
But there's no need to bother
So raise your hands up high
Reach for the sky, motherfucker, die

I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery
Ghouls and creeps fucking gather 'round
For the evil that's going down
I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery

This house of horrors has thirteen doors
Behind each one is thirteen more
Murder by numbers, count 'em one, two, three
Nail up the coffin and fucking bury me

Now you scream in horror
But there's no need to bother
So raise your hands up high
Reach for the sky, motherfucker, die

I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery
Ghouls and creeps fucking gather 'round
For the evil that's going down
Get down!

Now you scream in horror
But there's no need to bother
So raise your hands up high
Reach for the sky, motherfucker, die

I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery
Ghouls and creeps fucking gather 'round
For the evil that's going down
I hear the devil and he's calling me
In the house by the cemetery
