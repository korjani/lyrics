I am the curse of the universe,
Cosmic, galactic, enemy
Raining green blood down on the earth,
Invade, destroy, repeat

Show no mercy, destroy! Destroy!
Show no mercy, destroy! Destroy!
Hail Ming, hail Ming...

I will destroy your so called earth
My victory is your demise
Chaos, destruction, from beyond the stars,
Death raining from the skies!

Show no mercy, destroy! Destroy!
Show no mercy, destroy! Destroy!

Hail Ming, hail Ming...
