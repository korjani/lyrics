[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers cover]

It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
I had the radio on, I was drivin
The trees flew by, me and jack were singin
Little runaway, I was flyin

Yeah runnin down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin on a mystery, goin wherever it leads
Runnin down a dream

It felt so good, like anything was possible
I hit cruise control and rubbed eyes
The last three days the rain was unstoppable
It was always cold, no sun shine

Yeah runnin down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin on a mystery, goin wherever it leads
Runnin down a dream

I rolled on as the sky grew dark
I put the pedal to the metal to make some time
Something good went down this road
Im pickin up whatever is mine, mine ,mine, o mine yeah

Yeah runnin down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin on a mystery, goin wherever it leads
Runnin down a dream
