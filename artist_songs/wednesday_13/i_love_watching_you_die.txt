Scream louder
They will never find you
You're mine now
In this hell I built for you

Dark forces
Ritual in full bloom
Pray for death
How much left is in you

You cling to life
Baptized in blood tonight

I just wanna cause your pain
I only wanna make you suffer
I wanna watch you beg and cry
I love watching you die

I just wanna cause your pain
I only wanna make you suffer
I wanna watch you beg and cry
I love watching you die

Bleed slower
I'm not even done with you
Soon you'll be
So cold and turning blue

Dark forces
Ritual in full bloom
Pray for death
How much left is in you

You cling to life
Baptized in blood tonight

I just wanna cause your pain
I only wanna make you suffer
I wanna watch you beg and cry
I love watching you die
