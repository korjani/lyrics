My room came alive, my dog just died, stacked 13 pennies in his eyes
I stared at the wall, it stared back at me
Started to breath and then it started to bleed

The moon cracked open and it started to flow
And my future was exposed
The gods gave me my own TV show and they called it 
Transylvania 90210

I had a plastic casket with candy bones inside
I put the skeleton together and it came to life
He said that I looked bored, he took a knife from the drawer
He said kill for me, what are you waiting for?

The moon cracked open and it started to flow
And my future was exposed
The gods gave me my own TV show and they called it 
Transylvania 90210
