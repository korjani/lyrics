Merry Christmas, ho ho ho
I'll be six feet under the snow
Jingle bells along the way
I'm a dead motherfucker and I'm counting my days
I've been too naughty, I forgot to be nice
I guess violence is my vice
So check your list Santa and check it twice
I'm a dead motherfucker all right

I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
Yeah, yeah

(All I want for Christmas is a custom fit casket with black velvet interior... Oh yeah, and a bucket of chicken)

Seasons beatings and a jolly farewell
By Christmas Eve, I'll be rotting so well
In a one horse open sleigh
Straight to hell laughing all the way
I've been too naughty, I forgot to be nice
I guess violence is my vice
So check your list Santa and check it twice
I'm a dead motherfucker all right

I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
Yeah, yeah

(Santa, if you're out there, and you can hear me, your fat ass better have me a freshly dug grave)

I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
I'll be buried by Christmas
Yeah, yeah
