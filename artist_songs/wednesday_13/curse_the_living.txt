Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

You're the scum, you're the scum of the earth
You're the wrenched reek now we shall curse
Exterminate now all mankind
Curse the living, be gone, so long, goodbye 

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

Put the rat, put the rat in the trap
Watch you snap its stick in just a flash
Every dog's gotta have its day
And today is the day that the dog gets slain

(Curse) all the liars
(Curse) the deceivers
(Curse) No forgiveness
Curse the living
[x2]

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

No escape, no escape for you
Get on your knees, now suck your tomb
Seal your fate, now take the pain
Exterminate this fucking race

(Curse) all the liars
(Curse) the deceivers
(Curse) No forgiveness
Curse the living
[x2]

Curse them all [x8]

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

It's the end, it's the end for you
You can bet your goddamn ass that's true
I got a noose calling your name
Saying “Hey, motherfucker, let's hang, hang, hang”

(Curse) all the liars
(Curse) the deceivers
(Curse) No forgiveness
Curse the living
[x2]

Curse the living
Curse the living
