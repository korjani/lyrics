I'm bad
Oh baby, I'm bad
And it feels good 
To be so bad
Well, I'm bad when I'm walking down the street
I'm punching babies, kicking puppies
I'm bad
Oh baby, I'm bad

I'm bad in the morning
I'm bad at life
I'm a bad mother fucker every single night
I'm bad at love
I'm bad at affection
I'm a bad mother fucker with a bad affliction

I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
So bad
So bad
So bad, bad
Baby, I'm so bad

I'm mean
Oh baby, I'm mean
You wanna know how mean?
Yeah, I'll tell you how mean
Well, I hated my books
Beat up the teacher
Burned down the church 
And pissed on the preacher
I'm mean
Oh baby, I'm mean

I'm bad in the morning
I'm bad at life
I'm a bad mother fucker every single night
I'm bad at love
I'm bad at affection
I'm a bad mother fucker with a bad affliction

I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
So bad
So bad
So bad, bad
Baby, I'm so bad

I'm bad in the morning
I'm bad at life
I'm a bad mother fucker every single night
I'm bad at love
I'm bad at affection
I'm a bad mother fucker with a bad affliction

I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
I'm bad at being human
(He's bad at being human)
So bad
So bad
So bad, bad
Baby, I'm so bad
