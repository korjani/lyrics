Where does it end, where does it begin,
My misery is my only friend,
From the hole in my head,
Or the infestion within,
I re-live the crime scene time and time again.

I am the monster that you never see,
Masked by the shadows on your city streets,
Roses are red, your're turning blue,
Violence is golden let me prove it to you.

I left a trail from hollywood to hell,
Destroy the world while you sleeping,
And i won't fail.

The body count remains unknown,
Remove the flesh from the bone,
Dismemberment is an art of it's own,
Just face the moon and put your death mask on.

Out go the lights and bump goes the night,
And with you fear comes my delight,
Homicidal thoughts from homicidal minds,
I'll take you all out one at a time.

I'm in your closet underneath your bed,
And when i'm not i'm in your head,
You've got the blood, you've got the face,
I've got the urge and now i want a taste.

I left a trail from hollywood to hell,
Destroy the world while you sleeping,
And i won't fail.

The body count remains unknown,
Remove the flesh from the bone,
Dismemberment is an art of it's own,
Just face the moon and put your death mask on.

Put Your Death Mask On.
