I'm the dog,
I'm the bone,
I'm the blood in the ice-cream cone,
I'm the sticks,
I'm the stones, yeah, thats breakn' your fuckin' bones.

I'm the dirt.
I'm the filth.
I'm your little happy pills
I'm the worms, in the can
I'm the corpse in the body bag.

Now we're ready for the non-stop thrills and chills
Bury the hatchet and the blood will start to spill

The stars, they will fall
And it don't mean nothin' at all
When you're a teen-aged waste stared in B-Movie Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Babylon

I'm your bug, in the shell
I'm your own, private Hell
I'm your hopes
Im your dreams
I'm the monster that makes you scream

I'm your neck, in the noose
I'm your screw thats comin' loose
I'm your curse
I'm your greed
I'm your neighborhood body theif

Now we're ready for the non-stop thrills and chills
Bury the hatchet and the blood will start to spill

[Repeat X2]
The stars, they will fall
And it don't mean nothin' at all
When you're a teen-aged waste stared in B-Movie Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
