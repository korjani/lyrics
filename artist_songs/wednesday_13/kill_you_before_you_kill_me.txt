B-B-Baby you and I don't get along
And one of us will have to go before too long
I'm just trying to find the fastest way
To make you the fuck away
And I know you've got a few tricks of your own

And you know I've tried to walk that line
With you a couple million times
Every time the mission failed
And I hope you understand
Why this has come to be
I've got to kill you before you kill me

Sometimes you and I don't see eye to eye
So let me load this gun again
And we can try
I'm just trying to find the fastest way
To blow you the fuck away
And I know you've got a few tricks of your own

And you know I've tried to walk that line
With you a couple million times
Every time the mission failed
And I hope you understand
Why this has come to be
I've got to kill you before you kill me

Go, go, go

And you know I've tried to walk that line
With you a couple million times
Every time the mission failed
And I hope you understand
Why this has come to be
I've got to kill you before you kill me
I've got to kill you before you kill me
I've got to kill you before you kill me
