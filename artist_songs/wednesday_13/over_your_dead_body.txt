Target set, you're the enemy,
It's death, motherfuckers, you're all casualties,
Bite the devil's tongue, gonna get in the mouth of hell,
No one can escape its cosmic spell.

Don't cry for your mama,
She can't help you now.
There's a blood bath going on tonight,
And it's starting now… right now!

Your body's lying on the ground,
Motherfucker, who's laughing now?

Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body

No way you're gonna survive,
Hunt you down, fucker, skin you alive.
Your next breath may be your last,
So go ahead, fucker, and take it fast.

Don't cry for your mama,
She can't help you now.
There's a blood bath going on tonight,
And it's starting now… right now!

Your body's lying on the ground,
Motherfucker, who's laughing now?

Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body

Hey! It's one by one
Hey! Till they're all fucking done
Hey! Run if you can
Hey! Here comes the boogeyman

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Your body's lying on the ground,
Motherfucker, who's laughing now?

Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
Over your dead body
