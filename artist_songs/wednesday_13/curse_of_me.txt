Take your breath
I rob you of your life
Oh how I love to see you cry
I'm your nightmare in shinning armor
Bringing horror

Your screams can't penetrate my insecurities
My heart stopped beating
When you first said that you loved me

And now I hold you close to me
But I still don't feel a thing
You're so cold and blue
And now I must forget you

Some things are worth dying for
And baby that ain't me
I'm sorry that you couldn't escape
This curse of me

Tonight I hold you one more time
With the stench of formaldehyde
You're my darkest secret
And in my crawl space is where I'll keep it

Your hopes and dreams
Won't ever see the light of day
I took your beauty, your purity
And locked it all away

And now I hold you close to me
But I still don't feel a thing
You're so cold and blue
And now I must forget you

Some things are worth dying for
And baby that ain't me
I'm sorry that you couldn't escape
This curse of me

This curse of me
This curse
This curse of me
