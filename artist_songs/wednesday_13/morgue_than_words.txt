Morgue than words

When the ambulance arrived
There was nothing they could do to save your life
There were pieces here and pieces there
Found some bubblegum stuck in your hair

So much morgue to see
So much morgue to do
And there's so many things
That I wish you could have heard
So much morgue for me
So much morgue for you
And I can't express myself baby

Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words

You had such beautiful eyes
It's hard to tell now they're covered in flies
I guess it's true that love could be sad
To see you hauled away in seven body bags

So much morgue to see
So much morgue to do
And there's so many things
That I wish you could have heard
So much morgue for me
So much morgue for you
And I can't express myself baby

Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words

You were the love of my life
And now the city morgue has put you on ice
You were the one that got away
I love you morgue than words can say

So much morgue to see
So much morgue to do
And there's so many things
That I wish you could have heard
So much morgue for me
So much morgue for you
And I can't express myself baby

Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words, morgue than words
Morgue than words
