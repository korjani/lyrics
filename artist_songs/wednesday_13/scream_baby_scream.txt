A world beyond your wildest screams,
Ghouls and goblins spooks and creeps,
Welcome to creature feature number thirteen.

I, I know what you're thinking.
That i bury the living.

[Chorus:]
Creeping through the mortuary, bite your nails it's getting scary.
Creeping, crawling in the murk, digging through the dirt GRAVEROBBER.
Average everyday cadaver.
Blood splatter what's the matter, corpse grinder body thief. Let me be your trick or treat.
A world beyond your wildest screams,
Ghouls and goblins spooks and creeps,
Welcome to creature feature number thirteen.

WOW,
Scream baby scream

I, know that it sounds strange,
That I, wanna eat your brains.

[Chorus]

WOW,
Scream baby scream

A world beyond your wildest screams,
Ghouls and goblins spooks and creeps,
Welcome to creature feature number thirteen.

WOW,
Scream baby scream
