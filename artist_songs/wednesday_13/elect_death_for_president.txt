Raise your wrist up in the air
And wave your razorblades like you just don't care
Use your voice, make homicide your choice

Politics coming straight from the crypt
Stirring up the world with its ugly stick
Put your faith in a shallow grave today

Red, yellow, black or white
It doesn't matter -- everyone dies tonight

Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death

Hooray for homicide
My left wing's baked and my right wing's fried
Vote for me and I'll legalize everything

Splish splash you're in a blood bath
Intentionally headed down the wrong path
But a dollar sign won't make you smile in your grave

Red, yellow, black or white
It doesn't matter -- everyone dies tonight

Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death

I'm on your side!

Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death

Vote for me!

Red, yellow, black or white
It doesn't matter -- everyone dies tonight

Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death

Trust in me

Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death, death for president
Elect death
