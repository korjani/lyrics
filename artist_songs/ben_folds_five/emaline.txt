I wish it was last September.
So we could lose ourselves in crowds everyday.
'Cos Emaline, don't walk in time,
she's not the same that's all you can say.

That we've learnt our lesson, but I,
Don't wanna walk away from Emaline.

They're talking now.
Does she know what they're saying?
She's got the air, to float above it.
I'm sinking in the summer champagne.

She's dear to me, and so expensive.
Now I'm not talking 'bout money.
Money talks,
I hate to listen,
but lately it's been screaming in my ear.

When I've heard enough, I tell myself-
That we've learnt our lesson, but I,
Don't wanna walk away from Emaline.

It only took me one look to understand Emaline,
sometime I don't know what she's saying.
Sometimes I do,
Sometimes I don't,
know what she's saying.
But I know,
I know,
I know what she wants to believe.

It wish it was last September.

Don't let me walk away from Emaline.
For stupid reasons,
now I'm talking 'bout money.
Money talks,
I hate to listen,
But lately it's been screaming in my ear.
Yeah, what advice! Girls need attention.
Or are you diffrent than all mine?
For all it's worth, she's got attention.
But people accuse you black and white.

Now I've heard enough, I'll tell you what.
Really shouldn't sit here and whine,
I'll take you down to see my Emaline.
