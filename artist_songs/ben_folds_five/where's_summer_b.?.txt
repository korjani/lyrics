I'd like to tell you, like to tell you
Tell you everything
'Cause nothing changes, ever changes
Nothing seems the same these days

Dave's been a mess since Cheryl left
Just sits at home and beats back death
And Beth still wears his stupid dress

There goes Joe Caparo again
With Darren's girlfriend
They're asking where ya been, like I know
Where ya been? Hey Summer, where ya been?

I tried to tell you, tried to tell you
Just took a bit too long
And now your phone is disconnected
And your shit's out on the lawn
The hardback cafe closed down
Now we've got Office Town
You shoulda stuck around

There go Ross and Frank again
They're holding hands
They're asking where ya been
Like I know where ya been
Hey Summer, where ya been?

I could take a train or fly away
Maybe write a book or change my name
I could settle down
