Howard, the strangest things
Have happened lately when I
Take a good swing
At all my dreams
They pivot and slip
I drop my fists and they're back
Laughing, Howard
My intention's become not to lose what I've won
Ambition has given way to desperation and I
Lost the fight from my eyes

[Chorus:]
Boxing's been good to me, Howard
Now I'm told, you're growing old
The whole time you knew
A couple of years I'd be through
Has boxing been good to you?

Howard, now I confess
I'm scared and lonely and tired
They seem to think I'm made of clay
Oh, another day
I'm not cut out for this
I just know what to say
I say

[Chorus:]

Well sometimes I punch myself, hard as I can
Yelling "Nobody cares!"
Hoping someone will tell me how
Wrong I am

[Chorus:]

Has boxing been good
Has boxing been good to you?
