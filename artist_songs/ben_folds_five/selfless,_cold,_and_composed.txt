I said what you wanted to hear
And what I wanted to say
So I will take it back
Are all the dishes intact?
Let them be broken
It's easy to be
Easy and Free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain selfless, cold and
Composed

You've done me no favor
to call and be nice
Telling me I
Can take anything I like
You don't owe me to be so
Polite
You've done no wrong
You've done no wrong
Get out of my sight
It's easy to be
Easy and Free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain
Selfless, cold, and
Composed

Come on baby. Now throw me 
a right to the chin
Don't you stare like 
You never cared
I know you did
You just smiled
like a band teller
telling me bleakly
have a nice life
