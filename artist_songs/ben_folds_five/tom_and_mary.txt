For the benefit of Tom and Mary,
before our guests arrive.
If they haven't found out already it's gonna blow their minds.
Will they find the strength to find the will to testify?
And for the benefit of Tom and Mary,
there's something we can't hide anymore.

Everybody here knows the story,
some have fabricated extra parts.
See the sisters shouting whispers,
feeding heartache to the sparks.
Put a damper on the party,
it'll lighten up this room.
And for the benefit of Tom and Mary,
they've got to see the truth today.

Miss Powersson says here they come.
And all the chatter and the smiles have come undone.
And you could here a pin drop on the carpet floor,
everyone's pretending not to hear them knocking at the door.

For the benefit of Tom and Mary,
before our guests arrive.
If they haven't found out already it's gonna blow their minds.
If they haven't found our already,
And all the seams all seem to show,
and for the benefit of Tom and Mary we gotta let,
the truth be known.
