Having isn't bliss, sunshine is amiss
Happy when you're cold, wanna be alone
He's a lot of steam, she's a lot of breath
Takes a lot to see, takes a lot to beg

And it's just like Mitchell Lane, everything's the same

Wanna kill your friends, reminded you of when
Happy when you're stoned, wanna be old

And it's just like Mitchell Lane, everything's the same
So go on, go on and complain

Remember when we were 15, and Robbie made that stupid face all day
I guess he made his point, cos I'm still here when I could be anywhere

Having isn't bliss, sunshine is amiss

And it's just like Mitchell Lane, everything's the same
So go on, go on and complain
