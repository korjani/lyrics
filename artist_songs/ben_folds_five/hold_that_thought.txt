She broke down and cried
At the strip mall acupuncturist
While the world went on outside

The Chinese doctor took her arm,
Gazed at the floor and read her wrist
For the secrets in her life

"Here's your medicine," she said
"If you do not smile at him, then someone else will."
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought too

Ah ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I was shown the thirty-six
Ways I'm not available
On a simple, easy chart

Later on that evening
On the beach in Santa Monica
It was a very risky start

Suppose the stupid chart is right
In a year will you still feel the same way?
Ah, well, you hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought too

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh

Did you ever see the film
Where a man is givin' spectacles
To make the world look upside-down?

He falls about the place 
But in time he somehow readjusts
And when they take the glasses off
The eyes he's always had see sky below him
And he falls again

Ah, but you hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooooh
