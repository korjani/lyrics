So you wanted 
to take a break
Slow it down some and
have some space

Well fuck you too
Give me my money back
Give me my money back
you bitch
I want my money back
(And don't forget to give
me back my black T-Shirt)

Wish I hadn't bought you
dinner
Right before you dumped me
on your front porch
Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
and don't forget

And don't forget.
