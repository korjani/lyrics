So will I.

And I guess I will protect myself from you.

You're not exactly what I'm looking for,
You don't even know that when I've got it straight,

And I guess I will protect myself from you.
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk.
I will protect myself from you.
I'll keep on reminding me,
I'm always free,
I'm always free to walk.

Always free.
Free to walk.

I don't give a shit about you.
