I came here thinking I could ease the pain
I came in spite of others’ good advice
I came here thinking sweet, sweet revenge
Bring me some sugar, let the games begin

I made a lot of bad decisions but tonight I’m breaking through
I came here to get over you

I had this dream about a wild bird
Black feathered picking at your beating heart
You reach for me and shout, “I need your love!”
Yet soon collapses when I call your bluff

Picking at your heart strings
I need your love

I started shaking when you told me that you found somebody new
I came here to get over you

And the lights are burning like kerosene
I can’t stop thinking about you and me
Did you cross your fingers when you told me you’d be true?

I came here to get
I came here to get
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you

I made a lot of bad decisions but tonight I’m breaking through
