Tony came back to town
With his cap and gown
That they give 'em at the state pen
Breaking and entering will do that
Tony's mama said 'he's only human'

Look what the cat dragged in
From his next to kin
Little sister hugs the tin man
Tony, she's grown
Ain't she pretty, in her little black dress
He's digging up the heart
To know the price he paid

You can hear the train
When you're in the cage
And you can smell the rain
And you can see the sage
Brush threaten the highway
But you can't drive
And when you finally put the asphalt to the tyre
Looks something like Sistene oil and fire
Ripping through the dark
He's digging up the heart

Digging up the heart
Digging up the heart
Well it ain't that strange
Any boy can change
Digging up the heart

One, two, three, four, five
Oh, me, oh, my
Count the reasons that you shouldn't be messing
With the sons of perdition
Never were gonna take you down
The straight and narrow
Fever dreaming of a place
That you just can't get
Like you're burning in a pit
Little brother, you're lying to yourself
If you think you've changed
It's just another heart
Ain't this something strange

When Tony left
They were scratching at the door
In particular, one wanted him more
Her name was Christie
The queen of Humboldt County
But 3 to 5 is a lifetime at that age
Christie met herself another boy, got engaged
Left him in the dark
He's digging up the heart

Digging up the heart
Digging up the heart
Well it ain't that strange
Any boy can change
He's digging up the heart
He's digging up the heart
Digging up the heart
With a little luck
When the times get rough
Digging up the heart

Well the clerk's got his hands up
But his mind's on the mark
His.38 beneath the register
He's digging up the heart

Digging up the heart
Digging up the heart
Well it ain't that strange
Any boy can change
Digging up the heart

He's digging up the heart
Digging up the heart
With a little luck
When the times get rough
Digging up the heart
Well it ain't that strange
Even boys can change
Digging up the heart
