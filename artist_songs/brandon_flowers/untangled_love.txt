Well let's say that now's the time to start
Blessed all, the young at heart
She's just here to look the part
In the fruit of all this labor land
Friday nights, football stands
Been fumbled by so many hands

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
I always hoped I'd see the light
Break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love, yeah
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, oh

It's been 21 years since I left home
I've been looking for a place to call my own
I see the silver lining shining like polished gold

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
And I always hoped I'd see the light
And break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love, yeah
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, true

Blue Skies
Live a landslide
Tumbles down today, I'm on your side
And if a twister and sweeps it all away
I'm on your side

Stay close, my love
This ain't right, look out trouble, we've had enough
I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
It took a lot of faith, it took a lot of lies
But I finally came to realize

Untangled love
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
You took me by surprise
Untangled love, yeah
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, true
Untangled love
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
You took me by surprise
Untangled love
It took me by suprise
