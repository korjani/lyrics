Seek out the light between
Time and confusion glowing up ahead
Instead of slipping through
You bit off more, much more than you could chew

You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready
Slow down and take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready
Slow down

We had a lot to learn
Table manners and grace, how to wait your turn
When time came to clear your slate
You had too much, had too much on your plate

You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready
Slow down and take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready now
Slow down

Take your medicine and crawl before you walk
Think it through before you open your mouth to talk
Be an advocate of joy
Find your little heart’s desire

And follow it
Whoa, baby you’re not ready
Slow down and take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready
Slow down
Baby, you’re not ready

You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready
Slow down and take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby you’re not ready now
Slow down

No no, no no
Don't be afraid
This is your year
It's gonna be all right
You’re a performer
Just take your time
But not too much time
No no, no no
