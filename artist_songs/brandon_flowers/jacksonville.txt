Slow down your mind
Fill the unknown spaces with truth and light
If you can find the time, time seems so slow
Now we’re stuck here asking, where did it go?
(And where do we come from?)
And what are we here for?

But there we were looking out some country window
And although we had our problems, we were fine
The sky was blue and the night was all I wanted
Let me be your comet, I will fly

Summertime so sweet
Luxuries of childhood were on our feet
In the sun sun sun
Baby run run run
Baby run run run
Baby run run run

Games will be portrayed

But there we were looking out some country window
And although we had our problems, we were fine
The sky was blue and the night was all I wanted
Let me be your comet, I will fly

The sky was blue and the night was all I wanted
Let me be your comet, I will fly

I’ve been to Jacksonville
I’ve been to Monterrey
I’ve felt a mother’s love
I’ve seen the colors change
I’ve cried a million tears
I’ve caused a million more
I’ve been to Jacksonville

There we were looking out some country window
And although we had our problems, we were fine
