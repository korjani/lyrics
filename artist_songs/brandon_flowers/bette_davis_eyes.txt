Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips are sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she blows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's ferocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She's got Bette Davis eyes
