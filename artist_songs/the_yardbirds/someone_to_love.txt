I ain't got nobody,
I ain't got no girl.
I ain't got no woman,
No-one in this world.

Want you to hold me,
Want you to love me.
Want you to thrill me baby,
Love me all night long.

You're like a rattlesnake,
Layin' on the floor.
When I turn around now,
You're gone right out the door.

Want you to hold me,
Want you to thrill me.
Want you to hold me baby,
Hold me in your arms.

I ain't got nobody,
No-one in this world.
I ain't got no woman,
I ain't got no girl.

Want you to love me,
Want you to thrill me.
Want you to love me baby,
Love me all night long.
