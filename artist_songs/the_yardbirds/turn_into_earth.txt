Ah-ah-ah...

How your restless hungry eyes,
Speak of cloudy summer skies.
The morning dew,
Turns into rain,
Lonely winds will call my name.

Dying leaves of seasons brown,
Losing life as they drift down.
Too soon in life,
Return to earth,
Only they can know their worth.

Distant dreams of things to be,
Wandering thoughts that can't be free.
I feel my mind,
Turning away,
To the darkness of my day.
