I'm searching for my baby
Well I think I'm gonna cry
I'm searching for my baby
I think I'm gonna cry, yeah
I can't find that woman
No matter how hard I try

Well I've got myself a car
And the thing is painted blue
Well I've got myself a car
And that thing is painted blue
But no matter what's done to me baby
I guess I'll always be blue

I got a hundred and fifty things
Now all I gotta find is you
I got a hundred and fifty things
Now all I gotta find is you
And if the Nazz don't help me baby
You better forget about me too
