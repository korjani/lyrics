Laughed and loved, when others sang,
Their songs of love, nothing rang,
Of truth to me.
And then I did not see reality,
But now I know.

Sad in mind, I thought I'd lost,
Someone who would share the cost,
Of being here.
But now you're always near,
And I must sing.

Knowing 'bout the happiness,
Of sharing nights with you.
Knowing 'bout the loneliness,
When I'm away from you.
Knowing is another song,
But this time for you.

Always wanting things not there,
Making fun, I didn't care,
For other's dreams.
But now to me it seems,
That I was wrong.

Knowing 'bout the happiness,
Of sharing nights with you.
Knowing 'bout the loneliness,
When I'm away from you.
Knowing is another song,
But this time for you.

I see when lovers cry,
They're trying to touch the sky,
But only find,
(Their arms are only blind,
To pains of love?)
