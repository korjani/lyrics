Don't know where to run to,
Don't know where to hide.
See my future coming,
Like the rising of the tide.
But I lost you,
Lost you woman.
The only woman,
Woman who was my kind.

Made me lose my money,
You made me lose my mind.
It's people like you, baby,
Going to rule mankind.
But I lost you,
Lost you woman.
The only woman,
Woman who was my kind.

But if you come back,
I won't be the same.
What you did to me,
You can hardly call humane.
But I lost you,
But I still love you.
The only woman,
Woman who was my kind.
