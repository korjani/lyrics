It's me, won't you write home?
Hope you're happy all alone.
Now please take care,
Love Mum and Dad.

Dear Ronnie, why'd you leave us?
We hate to make a lot of fuss.
What made you go?
Love Mum and Dad.

They never understand,
They never understand a single word we say.
Their living's not for real,
They're living for a deal too far away,
Too far away,
Too far away.

Love Mum and Dad.

Like to know you're safe now,
Wonder what's your fate now.
What'd we do wrong?
Love Mum and Dad.

They never understand,
They never understand a single word we say.
Their living's not for real,
They're living for a deal too far away,
Too far away,
Too far away.

Love Mum and Dad.

Love Mum and Dad.
