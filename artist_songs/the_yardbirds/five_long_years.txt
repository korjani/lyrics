Well, have you ever been mistreated?
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Well, have you ever been mistreated?
D'you know what I'm talking about?
I worked five long years for one girl,
She had the nerve to put me out.

Got a job in a steel mill,
Shucking steel like a slave.
Five days and every Friday, I work and bring home my pay.
If you've ever been mistreated,
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Well, I worked five long years for one girl,
She had the nerve to put me out.

I finally learned my lesson, should a long time ago.
The next little girl that I marry,
She work and bring me some gold.
