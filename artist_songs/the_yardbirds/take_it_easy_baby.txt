Take it easy, baby 
So I can get along with you
Take it easy, babe
I might get along with you
The light you shine to live
You know I don't approve

Little girl, now, you just take it easy
Let me make you understand
You ain't nothin' but a female
And God knows I am a man
Take it easy, babe
That's all I want you to do

I love you darlin'
I'm afraid somethin' bad might happen to you

I will fix your breakfast
And I will bring it to your bed
Little girl, I'll brush your teeth
Time and comb your hair
Take it easy, baby 
And I might try and get along with you
Woah, I'm so 'fraid darlin'
Somethin' bad might happen to you
(Somethin' bad happen to you)
