Yeah the bells have tolled,
And my baby caught that train and gone.
Oh the bells have tolled,
And my baby caught that train and gone.
Well it's all my fault,
I must have done somebody wrong.

Well it's all my fault,
And I just can't explain.
Yes it's all my fault,
And I just can't explain.
Gonna get me a new (doctor/doll[?]),
So maybe my luck will change.

My baby's (treating me that my luck would change[?])
I've been goin' around,
And now look at me,
Done somebody wrong,
Well it's all my fault,
I must have done somebody wrong.
