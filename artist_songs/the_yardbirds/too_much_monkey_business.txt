Runnin' to-and-fro, hard workin' in the mill
Never fail in the mail, yeah, come a rotten bill
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Salesman talkin' to me, tryin' to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week, ahh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Blond hair, good lookin', tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Every day, same thing, gettin' up, goin' to school
No need for me complaining, my objection's overruled, ahh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Telephone, something wrong, dime gone, will mail
Oughtta sue the operator, for telling me a tale, ahh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

I been to Yokohama, been fightin' in the war
Army bunk, army crew, army food, army corps, aah
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tyres, check the oil, a dollar gas
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Too much monkey business for me!
