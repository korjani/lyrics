Glimpses of clouds in a forest,
Can review well within us,
And to never linger on one is life,
Energy radiates from the source,
The life around us is but a reflection of our own,
Flowing within never-ending boundless infinity,
Time is just a cumular limit,
Which with one glimpse can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome.
