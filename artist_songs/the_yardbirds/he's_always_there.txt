You're looking my way,
That's good to see.
Well how I'm thinking,
Is it really me.
You'll give me something,
That (lights up all[?])
It can't be just my,
My eyes you call.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,
But he's always there.

You're fixing my eyes,
With a constant gaze.
It could really have me,
In an utter daze.
Come a little closer,
He's not to see,
There's something going,
Between you and me.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,
But he's always there.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,
But he's always there.

He's always there.
He's always there.
He's always there.
