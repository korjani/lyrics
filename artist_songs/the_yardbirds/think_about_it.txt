When will the clouds all roll away?
When will the good people have their say?
I hope you're still round to see the day.
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.

Who can tell what is up or down?
You can be the king or be the clown.
Then climb your tree, take a look around.
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.

Circles of life, an infinite plane,
That which is now now will be again.
Who can decide who is insane?
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.
Take a while,
Think about it.
