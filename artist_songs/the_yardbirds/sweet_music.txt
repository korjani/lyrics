Sweet music,
Sweet music.

Why do my heart skips a beat?
- Pretty music,
What makes the soul come out of me?
- Pretty music,
Somebody's really gotta tell me,
- Pretty music,
What makes this music sound so sweet?
- Pretty music,

Sweet music,
Sweet music.

What puts the rhythm on in my feet?
- Pretty music,
They start to tap with every beat.
- Pretty music,
Well, it's a strange, strange feeling but it's real,
- Pretty music,
It gives me such a magic thrill.
- Pretty music,

Sweet music.

Could it be the beat of the drums?
Could it be the harp that charms?
The wailing guitars are so great,
They really put the rhythm of today.

I've gotta really, really know why,
- Pretty music,
Some of the music brings tears to my eyes.
- Pretty music,
Emotion really starts to scream in my soul,
- Pretty music,
Like love so new, just won't grow old.
- Pretty music,
