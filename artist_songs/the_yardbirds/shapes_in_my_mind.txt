Shapes in my mind
My eyes are closed
The colours cry
My brain explodes
My body shrinks into my head
I must have help or I'll be dead

Please!

You've got to make be break this spell
You've got to give me all your help
You've got to stop my spinning brain
You've got to be with me again

I see your face
I see your smile
I see the eyes that used to cry
I see the lips I used to kiss
I can't forget
I see you standing all alone
I see the things that I did wrong
I see I didn't try enough
To give you love

The love you gave
And left behind
Has dropped and burned inside my mind
I can't see out
I can't see in
I know I'm lost, I can't explain
The pain I felt is here again
I've nothing left
Is this the end?

I see your face
I see your smile
I see the eyes that used to cry
I see the lips I used to kiss
I can't forget
I see you standing all alone
I see the things that I did wrong
I see I didn't try enough
To give you love
