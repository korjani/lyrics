See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind of summer blow your hair upon your head
See the rain, the falling rain, it's rain

Still I'm sad

Oh my flowers, my tears just falling two days
We are driving the night to find they are lost
Flower, flower the wind is blowing, time into my heart
When the wind blows hard, we are apart

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

Still I'm sad
