I walk 47 miles of barbed wire,
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie,
I got a brand new house by the roadside,
Made outta rattlesnake hide.
I got a brand new chimney made on top,
Made out of a human skull,
Come on take a little walk with me, baby,
And tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mine,
Just 22 and I don't mind dying.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Goin' round this town, take a rattlesnake whip,
Come on baby, don't give me no lip,

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Night was black, sky was blue,
Round the corner, ice-wagon flew,
Heard a bump, heard a scream,
You should have seen just what I seen.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

My baby took me by the hand,
And said come on baby, I understand.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

That's very nice!

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
