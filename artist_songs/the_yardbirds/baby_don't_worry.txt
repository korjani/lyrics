Hey baby, honey, what's wrong with you?
Oh baby, honey, what's wrong with you?
Well now ya don't treat me darlin', like you used to do

Well now ya got me runnin' baby
Got me hidin', too
Tell me, tell me, baby, but
What we gonna do?

Oh oh baby, honey, what's wrong with you?
Well now you don't treat me, baby
Like you used to do

Well, I can't help it baby
'Cause I'm feelin' strange
I'm just hopin' baby
I don't go insane

Oh oh, baby, honey, what's wrong with you?
Well now you don't treat me baby
Like you used to do
