Well I'm gonna get up in the morning
Hit the Highway 49
I'm gonna get up in the morning
Hit the Highway 49
I've been looking for my baby
Melv darling down[?] on my mind

First I'll stop by whiskey store,
I'm gonna buy me a jug o'wine
First I'll stop by whiskey store,
I'm gonna buy me a jug o'wine
I will hit the highway
They call Highway 49

Gonna be soon in a morning
When I go rollin' in a Jackson town
It will be soon in a morning
When I go rollin' in a Jackson town
I'll be looking for Melv my dear
They said she cant be found

Melv darling my sweet woman
You know she stayed on my mind
Melv darling my sweet woman
You know she stayed on my mind
If I cant find that woman 
I will sit out and drink my vine
