If you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
Yes you do.
Well, if you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
They got such pretty little girls in that big town,
Make a man wanna jump around and shout.

I met a little girl there,
She was about five foot eight.
I said "I want you to love me."
She said "Why man, that'd be great."
So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there,
Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.

Alright now, this is how it was,
Oh no!

Well alright!

I finally learned my lesson,
Such a long time ago,
Next little woman that I date,
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too.
Yes indeed, I gotta know her family too.
But if you don't want to be filled full of shotgun holes,
Mister, this song is just for you.
