Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town.
All the little girls there are trying to put poor sloopy down.
Sloopy, I don't care what you're daddy do.
You know little girl, I'm in love with you.

All together now,
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.

Sloopy lets her hair down every time she's out on the town,
- Hang on sloopy.
Sloopy lets her hair down every time she's out with me,
- Hang on sloopy.
Come on sloopy,
- Come on, come on.
Come on girl.
- Come on, come on.
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good, good.
- Good, good, good, good.
Good, good, good, good.
- Good, good, good, good.
I wanna say aaahh - aaahh - aaahh.
Hang on sloopy.

Mmmm, baby don't you know,
You thrill me so.
I love you so,
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, baby.
Love the way that you dance,
Give me one chance.
And I'll sweep you away.
I wanna say aaahh - aaahh - aaahh.
Hang on sloopy.

Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
All together now,
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
A little bit quieter.
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
All down.
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
Psss, whisper it.

Very, very quiet.
Hang on sloopy,
Sloopy, hang on.
Come on sloopy,
Come on, come on.
Yeah, now come on girl.
Come on, come on.

Come away with it little girl.

Love the way you talk, baby.
