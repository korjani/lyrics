Pennsylvania snow is pretty thick
Michigan ain't where I get my kicks

Texas is fine but it gets too hot
And New York City's not a place to stop

New Orleans is the home of the blues
But California's my home with Mary Hughes

Down in Mississippi I'm told is nice
And all the meals there, they come with rice

Oregon and Iowa are not for me
The Colorado mountains are something you must see

But back in California there's nothing to lose
'Cos everything's swinging there with Mary Hughes
