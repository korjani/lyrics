Winter's gone,
I can feel the summer coming on.
The sun is high,
But no higher than I.
Everything is turning green,
Growing in the summer sun,
Shining where the sun has been.

Me and you,
Such a lot of things to do.
We can go far away,
Go round the world in a day.
All we need is to stay right here,
(Groovin' 'til we're[?]) all alone,
Heaven when I hold you near.

Mellow (golden hay[?])
Lazy Saturday,
Nothing much to say,
'cept I love you,
I think I do.
Sitting by the stream,
Think it's all a dream,
Nothing better to be seen,
'cept your smiling eyes,
That say you will,
Stay and love me 'til the evening chill,
Brings a thousand sighs.
