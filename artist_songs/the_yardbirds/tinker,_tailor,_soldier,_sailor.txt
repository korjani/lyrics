Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
Doctor, baker, fine shoe-maker,
Wise man, madman, taxman, please,
How can I know just what to be?
Please stop and give advice to me.
Tell me,
Tell me,
How many people do I help,
Just by sitting on the shelf,
Tell me,
Tell me,
I don't want a trade at all,
(It's for to[?]) living off the road.
Ooooh,

Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
Doctor, baker, fine shoe-maker,
Wise man, madman, taxman, please.
Who's gonna tell me what to do?
Then they will say that I am true.
Maybe,
Maybe,
Perhaps I'll come to a great success,
Or possible a dreadful mess.
Maybe,
Maybe,
(Having buys its[?]) fortune, fame,
Living's just a little game.
Woooo-aaah,

Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,
