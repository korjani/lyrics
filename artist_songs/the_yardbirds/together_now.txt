Tell me the time,
Dandelion clock say quarter to nine.
The garden awakes,
A passing bee says that everything's fine.

Eyes wide,
Deep inside,
Now I know,
Time has brought us love.
Day breaks,
Love awakes,
All that's you,
All that's me,
Together now.

Corn flowers blue,
Sway in the breeze, and say that I love you.
Great when you smile,
It's like you feel when the sun is shining through.

Eyes wide,
Deep inside,
Now I know,
Time has brought us love.
Day breaks,
Love awakes,
All that's you,
All that's me,
Together now.

Eyes wide,
Deep inside,
Now I know,
Time has brought us love.
Day breaks,
Love awakes,
All that's you,
All that's me,
Together now.

Eyes wide,
Deep inside,
Now I know,
Time has brought us love.
Day breaks,
Love awakes,
All that's you,
All that's me,
Together now.
