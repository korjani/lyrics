Watching TV just the other day,
Saw an advertisement, what can I say?
It showed a small baby, and some men in a war,
I thought to myself, "What's this fighting all for?"

And I felt sad,
Felt bad,
I'm not pleased,
There's no need,
Taking a hold on me,
Knew it just had to be,
Never knew how it was,
Knew it was just because.

I spoke to some fellows here, early last night,
One of those guys, he prepared for a fight,
He couldn't agree to the things that I said,
Am I speaking so free? He thought I should have been dead.

And I felt sad,
Felt bad,
I'm not pleased,
There's no need,
Taking a hold on me,
Knew it was just to be,
Never knew how it was,
Knew it was just because.

In my hotel room, a bible I saw,
[?] and what's more,
[?] no more [?]
So why not be like him, don't read all those [?]

I feel sad,
Feels bad,
Not pleased,
There's no need,
Taking a hold on me,
Knew it just had to be,
Never knew how it was,
Knew it was just because.

Taking a hold on me,
Taking a hold on me,
Taking a hold on me,
Taking a hold on me,
Taking a hold on me,
Taking a hold on me.
