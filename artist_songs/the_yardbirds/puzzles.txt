You never talk straight to me,
It's all puzzles to me.
If there's sense in what you talk about,
I can never see.
If you don't want me to spend your life with you,
Go and find someone new.
'Cause I know there's so many better girls than you.

Puzzles, hanging on my mind now,
Puzzles, puzzles in my mind,
In my mind,
That's all I find,
In my mind.

Life's puzzles,
I will never know,
Which way to go straight.
Love, war, people arguing,
How can they know what to hate?
Ever since I began thinking,
I wondered why things were so.
But no matter how hard I contemplate,
Puzzles will never go.

Puzzles, hanging on my mind now,
Puzzles, puzzles in my mind,
In my mind,
That's all I find,
In my mind.

Ooh, puzzles.
