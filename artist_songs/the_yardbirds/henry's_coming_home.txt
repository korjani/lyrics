Henry's coming home,
Wonder if he found it.
He just telephoned,
Think he must have found it.

He wants to live in the village,
Where he started out.
He knows what life's about,
In the city.

He knows where you'll always find it,
If you really look.
If you have to work,
It's a pity.

Henry's coming home,
Wonder if he found it.
He just telephoned,
Think he must have found it.

He was in love with the city,
When he was a boy.
Now he's not a boy,
Any longer.

He sees the world so much better,
Since he's been away.
Now he's coming home,
All the stronger.
