Make me feel the greatest guy.
I'm gonna love you baby,
Love you till you cry.

Stay with me baby,
Make me always feel so fine.
Stay with me baby,
Make me always feel so fine,
So I can tell all the world,
You always gonna be mine.

Smile on me baby,
Make me feel like summer's here.

Prove it to me baby,
That our love is in the clear.
