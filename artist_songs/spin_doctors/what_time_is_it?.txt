What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw,
Just early, early, early

President, he sweat through his talcum
News paper man, he watch like a falcon
"Ah, look...daddy-o...sorry, Mr. President...where ya been?"
Use a little english to doctor the spin

What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw,
just early, early, early

It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me...

Ayatollah, he's hopping mad
Jibber about some damn jihad
Send me back to old Baghdad
Spin Doctor its oh so sad

What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw,
Just early, early, early

It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me...
