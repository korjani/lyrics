I got a girl like pudding and pie
She's the candy, candy apple of my eye
'n' I got icing and sweet cream filling
Every time she leaves the milk is spilling
She's got the key to the pantry door
She makes me feel like a kid in a candy store
I call my baby sugar cause she's sweet like honey
Every time we talk she says something funny
When she walks in the room boys stop and stare
Are they looking at her or at her eclair
When we sleep we have sweet dreams
And when I'm bad she whips my cream

Call my baby sugar 'cause she's sweet like honey
Every time I see her she's right on the money
She's the sugar in my cup of tea
She got her sticky fingers all over me
She's sweet as honey, she's sweet as honey
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy, candy

My sweet tooth habit I just can't break
Hard like candy, soft like cake
Like cotton candy she's always floating
Like an M&M she got a candy coating
Call my baby sugar 'cause she's sweet like honey
Got jellybeans and a chocolate bunny
My Milky Way, my Shining Star
She only drinks at the candy bar
Once she starts she never stops
To take her lips from her lolly pop
She never wears the perfume I gave her
Always smells like wintergreen Lifesavers

Call my baby sugar 'cause she's sweet like honey
Every time I see her she's right on the money
She's the sugar in my cup of tea
She got her sticky fingers all over me
She's sweet as honey, she's sweet as honey
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy, candy

She's sweet as honey, she's sweet as honey
She's sweet as honey, she's sweet as honey
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy, candy
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy
She's so sweet, so sweet and dandy
Soft like cake and hard like candy, candy, candy, candy
