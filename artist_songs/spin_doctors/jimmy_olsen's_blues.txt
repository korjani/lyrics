Well, I don't think I can handle this
A cloudy day in Metropolis
I think I'll talk to my analyst
I got it so bad for this little journalist
It drives me up the wall and through the roof
Lois and Clark in a telephone booth
I think I'm going out of my brain
I got it so bad for little miss Lois Lane

Lois Lane please put me in your planner
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no Superman
Come on downtown and stay with me tonight
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
I got a pocket full of kryptonite

He's leaping buildings in a single bound
I'm reading Shakespeare at my place downtown
Come on downtown and make love to me
I'm Jimmy Olsen not a titan, you see
He's faster than a bullet, stronger than a train
He's the one who got lucky got his cape around miss Lois Lane
I can't believe my dilemma is real
I'm competing with a man of steel

Lois Lane please put me in your planner
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no Superman
Come on downtown and stay with me tonight
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
I got a pocket full of kryptonite

O-oh
Got a pocket full of...

I don't think I can handle this
A cloudy day in Metropolis

I got it so bad for this little journalist

Lois Lane please put me in your planner
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no Superman
Come on downtown and stay with me tonight
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
I got a pocket full of kryptonite

Oh, Miss Lois Lane

I got a pocket full of...
