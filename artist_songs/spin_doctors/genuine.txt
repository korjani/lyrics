Have you ever left out on four wheels...
Not knowing where you'll get to boys?
Hit the road and don't look back
Everybody's got a choice
Broken lines, blurring times, engine runnin', passing signs
Freedom dances high
Colored lights, green and blue
Bringing back the things you do
Her memory's still in your mind

Hitchin' out on a fine line
To the mountains on the other side
Love you warm like the sun shines
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine

I felt the magic call me yesterday, yeah
We spoke about the people in our worlds...
Said that no thing's more important baby
Than a boy and a girl...
Well the circle spins, blackened fins
Looking down the sights and then...
We're all equal naked souls
Try to hold the hands of time
Slap you down, stop your mind
If I could only close my eyes and roll...

Hitchin' out on a fine line
To the mountains on the other side
Love you warm like the sun shines
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine

Magic land in Los Piedras
I want to stay, I'll never leave
Let the sun and spirits dance
Everybody's got a chance
Well one thousand stops I should've made
Always left.  I never stayed...
Who knows what would've been?
Love that weaves and intertwines...
Looking for that genuine
Love that knows just what I've seen

Hitchin' out on a fine line
To the mountain on the other side
Love you warm like the sun shines
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine
Love me baby 'cause I'm genuine

Genuine
Genuine, yeah
Genuine
Genuine
