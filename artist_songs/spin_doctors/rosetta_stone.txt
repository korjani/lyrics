Take the lowest common denominator,
The tiniest grain of sand.
Like the first digit of our fingers
Points back to the whole hand.

Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night,
You'd feel a rise at this mantle

The catalyst or the detonator
The place where it all again
The bottom floor of the elevator,
The grandfather of the middleman.

Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night,
You'd feel a rise at this mantle

Waxing givers
Slip between the sheets of minds.
Rosetta stone
Like the skeleton
Reassembled bone by bone by bone by bone

Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night,
You'd feel a rise at this mantle
