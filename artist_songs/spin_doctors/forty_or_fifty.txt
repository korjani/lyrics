Forty or fifty horses
Lying in a lot.
Red raincoats and rifles,
An epidemic has been stopped.
Scientist speaks what are you
wondering about?
He got where he is by turning
Lab mice inside out.

The things we do
And have to do
The things I do for you
And what you do for me too
The "yeah, but I..."
And any other excuse
And if you take it for given
Then what's the use

All his possessions
Around him in his house,
Lying beside him his
Companion and his spouse.
And in the morning
He dress and go to hell.
All activated by
A little timer bell.
