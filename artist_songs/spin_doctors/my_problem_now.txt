I don't mind when you kiss and talk 
It's so sweet when you chew gum and walk 
The other boys they watch you pass 
And wish that they were in your class 

I stole you from my ex-best friend 
Now I wish I could give you back again 
I thought that I was just so smart 
I stole your hand but you stole my heart 

I guess you're my problem now 
You're gonna get me in trouble and you don't care how 
Much I love you, you make no vow 
I guess you're my problem now 

When I Leapt before I looked 
I bit the bait around the hook 
I wish I hadn't wished for you 
'Cause I wished off more than I could chew 

I guess you're my problem now 
You're gonna get me in trouble and you don't care how 
Much I love you, you make no vow 
I guess you're my problem now 

I don't know if you'll keep me round 
Or keep me down 
I fought and now I'm caught 
In the threads of the web I wound 

The other boys they give me looks 
When I walk you home and carry your books 
You're so good but you're so bad 
The best bad time I've ever had
