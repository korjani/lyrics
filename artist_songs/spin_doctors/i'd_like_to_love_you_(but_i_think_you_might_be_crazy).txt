Oh your drowning eyes search the swimming skies 
For a break in the rain, oh you never change 
Slow motion breeze like a star lost in space 
Your facts are clear but your point is hazy 

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do 
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too 

You're a little bird whose song is overheard 
Looking over your shoulder, do you want a lover or a soldier 
Oh you're not always nice, but you're warmer than ice 

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do 
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too 

I don't have all the cards I'd like to deal ya 
I'm my own best friend, you're your own Ophelia 
You're a symphony short one note 
You're a winter short of a coat 
You might be a petal short of a daisy 

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do 
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy 
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too 

You make me crazy too.
