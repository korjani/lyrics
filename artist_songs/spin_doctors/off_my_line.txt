I've been thinking lately
How to get you off my line
Don't seem all that easy but it
Feels alright
I've gotten rid of expectations
that I used to have
And we don't get along and it really ain't so bad

Somewhere in between the blue & the red
"This is temporary," is all she said
Someday things may be a little better than before
All these mysteries and they're knocking at my door

Alone in my room
I lay awake and dream
I'm sleeping half awake I got to
Try to explain
That I don't need your love and it
Means this much to me
I don't need your love woman won't you see

Somewhere in between the blue & the red
"This is temporary," is all she said
Someday things may be a little better than before
All these mysteries and they're knocking at my door

She must not realize
What this means to me
I figured out her disguise
Hey, mama, I'm not dreaming
(she's way off reality)
