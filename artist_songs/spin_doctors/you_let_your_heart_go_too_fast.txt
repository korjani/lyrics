Having been by that old bank tower,
I'm inclined to wonder why you feel so strong.
You can't have really seen the hour
If you think she's trying to do you wrong.
I see you got that lump in your throat
I hear you mumbling, "That's all she wrote."
Love was in the next room drinking antidote.

You ought to know that girl by now.
She'll never settle down anyhow.
You let your heart go too fast.
You let your heart go too fast.

Broken glass turns back to flint and sand.
I only cease to love as love demands.
As you know it takes a while to clap those
fragments from your idle hands.
Couple months could dry a sea of tears,
leave only salt beneath our dried up piers.
We won't believe we cared, I swear, in a couple years.

You ought to know that girl by now.
She'll never settle down anyhow.
You let your heart go too fast.
You let your heart go too fast.

If time heals all wounds, don't you know that
Time also deals them.
The days go by, and everybody feels them.
We stuggle with our fates,
But our action only seals them.

They say that murder ain't the fault of the weapon.
I'm smoking sad to be the gun.
I want to blow you all away, but I don't want to put no
Bullets into anyone.
I see the feathers that enfringe your heart.
I see the blood ooze from around the dart.
Cupid spites the sense that keeps two 
Mismatched souls apart.
