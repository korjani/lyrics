Now and then I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though its been so long it brings me back
Right back to you

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me

How yah been I'd love to hear bout how you been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had and love to have again

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
