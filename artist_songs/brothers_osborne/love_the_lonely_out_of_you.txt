I can tell that you're lonely
Pour it all out on me
Because I have been lonely too
That's a heartache you're drinkin'
And I can feel what you're thinkin'
Let's do what the lonely do

Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you

Take everything that makes you sad
Let it out and leave it in the past
You don't need that for what I've got in mind
Wrap those arms around me
Close your eyes and baby you'll see
It ain't that hard to leave it all behind

Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you

Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you
