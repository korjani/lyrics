Oh it sounds like a fire in store
Holding down while the tides are strong
I survive a wave but now I'm gone
How am I to change the damage done?
Maybe today, today we die [2]
Give us and take away the cries
Baby today we die
There's a fire in the wind and the oxygen

When I took it away you came undone
Even the rain can take the sun

Another thing to steal that's mine
It's unbelievable human kind

I've had the hardest fall
I'm drowning and now I'm sinking into it all
Remember the words of someone
Someone I used to know
Love everyone but keep them
Far from your soul
