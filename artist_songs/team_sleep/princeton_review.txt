I liberate 
I liberate the cold inside 
Camouflaged 
But is it all same guy, same guy? 

There's a bad scene 
Worked up and sterilized 
There's a black seed 
Chocked up and burning 

Unfamiliar, unremorseful 
That's the way you were 
Don't want to bring it up again 
That's the way you were 
Oh, well 

You raise questions of me 
You haunt sections of town 

Unfamiliar, unremorseful 
That's the way you were 
Don't want to bring it up again 
That's the way you were 
Unfamiliar, unremorseful 
That's the way you were 
Don't want to bring it up again 
That's the way you were 

Be this or not I know I don't understand 
How this is appropriate 
Be this or not and no we don't understand 
How bad at debate we are 
And so we freeze 
And so we freeze 
And so we freeze
