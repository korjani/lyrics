Froze asleep 
Coma deep 
I dream I'm not out with you 
Alone at sea 

And you watched the waves 
And you sang to me 
As we sink 
I dream I'm not out with you 

Dropping deep 
Below the sea 
This dream I had with you 
Alone at sea 

And we watch the waves 
You sing to me 
As we sink 
This dream I had with you 
Alone at sea...
