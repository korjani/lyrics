You waste your life making film 
Through the frames 
You revealed 
The screen goes down 
The tape runs out 
Or the machine ceases 
To operate 
She'll team up 
With our parade 

We watch all the tapes push pause 
And wave over and over at the screen 
The frames go down 
The tape runs out 
Or the machine ceases 
To operate 
She'll team up 
With our parade 

We watch all the tapes push pause 
And wave over and over at the screen 
The frames go down 
The tape runs out 
Or the machine ceases 
To operate 
She'll team up 
With our parade
