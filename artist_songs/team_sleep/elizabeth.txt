If it looks broken 
That's just the picture 
That's how you know 
If it's in focus 
Then it's no fun for guys like me 

These robots have it wired around here 
They'll make slaves of us soon 
Canvas the neighborhood 

I mean it...watch 

Step away 
Don't look that close 
They could be anywhere 
Hid up in the ballast 
Down in the basement 
Camped out in the bunker 
If it should come back 
We'll set the tracers 
Break it in easy 

These robots have it wired around here 
These robots have it wired around here 
(these robots have it wired around here) 
Circuits on babylon 
Crackeed up on some lawn 
Chasing these scenes 
Given a fever 
Retless manner 
Is it worth your soul? 
They might leave tomorrow 
They might leave tomorrow 
They might leave tomorrow 
They might leave tomorrow
