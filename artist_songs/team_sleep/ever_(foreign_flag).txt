You make that dance look so new 
And I'm in awe 
A face like you've never seen 
I'm yours tonight 
So come on 
Light the stage 
So we can all take off 
Anywhere 
We'll never come back 
Ever 

You wear that cast so cool 
And I'm in awe 
A face like you've never seen before 
Around 
So come on, yeah 
Light the stage 
So we can all take off 
Anywhere 
We'll never come back 
Ever 

Lie on the stage 
You picture all of us everywhere 
We'll never come back 
Ever
