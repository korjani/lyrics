In 1969 
I killed a man of mine 
In a small montana town 
I was hunted down by hounds 

Hear the light has cried 
Their voices dry and hollow 
Hear the crowd cheer 
They cheer me to the gallows 

In 1985 
I was doing time alive 
I made a plan to escape 
And live as the lady of the lake 

Hear the crowd of ghosts 
Their voices dry and holow 
Can't you hear their calls? 
They cheer me to the gallows 

1995 
Was the year I came up for trial 
I listened to his song 
And watched the sun make the shadows long 

Hear the light have cried 
His voices is dry and hollow 
Hear the crowd call 
They cheer me to the gallows 
Hear the light called 
His voices is dry and follow 
Hear the light have called 
In a voice that's hollow
