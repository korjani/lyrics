I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head

I’ve done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, try to forget it
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I’m feeling stressed

I need to do something
I fucked up for nothing
Now I gotta just tell someone,
Tell someone what I’ve done

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Oh, no, like gasoline

I wake up the morning after
You call but I don’t answer
And I can’t look you in the eye,
No matter how hard I try

You deserve forever,
not a boy looking for better
But as long as you’re still here,
Imma try to keep you near

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, just like gasoline
