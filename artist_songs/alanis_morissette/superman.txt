I'm lookin' for someone who can made me feel
A serious love like Juliet's is real
A little impulsive and a boy at heart
A little bit shy but he'll be oh so smart

Superman I need a superman

You got a complicated girl like me
He's gotta be fair and treat me properly yeah
I want him to understand equality
You gotta Keep searchin' everywhere in the world
You gotta keep lookin' or you'll miss the feelin'

[CHORUS:]
You gotta be tough to make it today who
You do it your way and not how they say
You'll find him somewhere
You gotta be tough to make it today who
And never be scared of finding your way
to Superman

Should I call him on the telephone
Should I go seem him or just stay at home
will be different from the other boys
if I could find him I'd be overjoyed

Superman where are you Superman
Whenever it seems like everything's on the line
You gotta keep lookin' or you'll miss the feelin'

[CHORUS]

With all the other boys I never knew
what it took to make a choice
When he's mine I'm gonna stop
all my changin' around now
Between the two of us there'll be
enough goin' on that's serious
I can't wait 'til I can stop
all my lookin' around now

I found my Superman I found my Superman

Whenever it seems like everything's
on the line you gotta keep lookin' or
you'll miss the feelin'

[CHORUS]
