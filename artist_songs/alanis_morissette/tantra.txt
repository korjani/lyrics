Hand upon a dimmer switch
To rough from delicate
Our one and only sacred itch
We scratch it cause we can

You make it fast or slow
In a way only you can
You drive your car
With masterful experience

You’re my hot
One woman man
You’re fading your control
Inside your dominion
And here I watch you wield
Your passionate command
And channeling them all
Into our secret Tantra
Our Tantrika

Arms around our future
With warmth along my back
Safety in this rapture
The most freedom I’ve had

And you unlock me love
In ways only you can
You keep me moving between
Power and submission

You’re my hot
One woman man
You’re fading your control
Inside your dominion
And here I watch you wield
Your passionate command
And channeling them all
Into our secret Tantra
Our Tantrika

Exploring this, our enticing portal
Delivering us into new heights
Beyond my fantasies
Straight into possible
The closest we’ve come
To this unite 

We’ve been on a roll since
Your breath first graced my skin
This fire unfolds steadily
It keeps me warm within

We keep progressing as
You offer full spectrum
And we’ll keep Tapening
Until our days are done

You’re my hot
One woman man
You’re fading your control
Inside your dominion
And here I watch you wield
Your passionate command
And channeling them all
Into our secret Tantra
Our Tantrika
