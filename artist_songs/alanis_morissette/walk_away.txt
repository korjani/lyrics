A downtown cafe Saturday evenin' and the
place is about to be closed I'm meeting my baby
yeah and order my hundreath cup of coffee today
My hands are shakin'

At half past seven I'm sittin here waitin' for
my boy all alone for too long It's after eleven
yeah I'm tired of waitin' and I'm gonna go home
cause I don't need this

You never think twice before you break all the rules
you gotta be crazy if you think I'm a fool

[CHORUS:]
I'll walk away and say good bye
If you don't want me anymore
I've bot my pride
I'll walk away and say good bye
if I don't get the love we had before
not satisfied

He finally gets here I'm waitin' for him to ask me 
why there's a frown on my face He orders a
cold beer he has an excuse about his car
breakin' down but I don't buy it
You're givin' me sometin' I don't need anymore
Just gimme the word and I'll be slammin' the door

[CHORUS]

His best intentians are never the same as what
he does of the end of the day. I'm feelin' the
tension yeah Don't gimme no reasons cause you
don't comprehend what am I feelin'
You never think twice before you break all the rules
You gotta be crazy if you think I'm a fool
You're givin' me somethin' I don't need anymore
Just gimme the word and I'll be slammin' the door

[CHORUS]

So tell me now Just say the word
It won't be long
I'll be long long gone...
