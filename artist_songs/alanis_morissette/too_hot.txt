Always too hot never too cold
You make your best shot too hot to hold
Never too young Never too old
You gotta go for gold

Hey boy you wanted all or nothin'
Lose the apprehension baby
And go with the flow cause you know you've got 
Stand up if you want the answers
You need to blast 'em straight up baby
So say what you mean and you mean to say now

Hey you don't have to go and prove it
You just go ahead and do it
Your time is for the takin', makin'
the best of what you got now

[CHORUS:]
Never too hot never too cold
You make your best shot too hot to hold
Never too young Never too old
You gotta go for gold

Don't care what they say about ya
You never throw a hero party
For those who oppose who you chose to be now
Maybe you could feel the power
It's like a bomb inside your head that blows if you're
slow when you go to use it
You, you gotta show them that you mean it just go ahead and scream it
And show them what they're missin' listen
to what your heart could tell ya

[CHORUS]

You gotta go for gold and you'll make it baby
Gold! And when you're there you gotta
Throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Reachin' teachin' practice what you're preachin'
Throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Movin' provin' everything you're doin'

[CHORUS]

You, you don't have to go and prove it
You just go ahead and do it
Your time is for the takin' makin'
the best of what you got now
Always too hot
Never too cold
Give your best shot
Go with the flow cause you know you've got to

[CHORUS]
