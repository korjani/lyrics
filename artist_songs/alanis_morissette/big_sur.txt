Highway One
Crystalline haunted sun
With the pacific masculine crash

My little one
Enthralled by the redwoods
As I ride amongst monarchs and mist

Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen and Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmut and Brautigan
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur

Deep celestial and frogs
Fritz and cabins of logs
Amongst the springs we are barefoot and warmed

Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen and Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmut and Brautigan
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur

I am climbing on the bluff
Beseeching God to answer us
Not much distracts from our shamanic creek breakfast
This wandering heartbeat by the forest

Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen and Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmut and Brautigan
All roads home to Big Sur

Me and Mickey and a path high on the Molera
Me and Lolly and Bill watching a red-tailed hawk
Me and the [?] all link through the big Ventana.
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur
