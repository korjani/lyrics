Something so benign for me construed as cruelty 
Such a difference between who I am and who you see 

Conclusions you come to of me routinely incorrect 
I don’t know who you’re talking to with such fucking disrespect 

This shit’s making me crazy 
The way you nullify what’s in my head 
You say one thing do another 
And argue that’s not what you did 
Your way’s making me mental 
How you filter as skewed interpret 
I swear you won’t be happy til 
I am bound in a straight jacket 

Talking with you’s like talking to a sive that can’t hear me 
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow what’s happening 

Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body 
One day I’ll introduce myself and you’ll see you’ve not yet met me 

This shit’s making me crazy 
The way you nullify what’s in my head 
You say one thing do another 
And argue that’s not what you did 
Your way’s making me mental 
How you filter as skewed interpret 
I swear you won’t be happy til 
I am bound in a straight jacket 

Grand dissonance 
The strings of my puppet are cut 
The end of an era 
Your discrediting’s lost my consent
