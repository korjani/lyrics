We said good-bye with so much left to say
We knew inside we'd find another way
We'll have it all, it's not too late to try
Maybe you and I could go from here
Maybe you and I can make it, this time we'll...

[CHORUS:]
Fall in love when we meet again
We can finish what we started
Fall in love if we try again
And then nothing will keep us apart

We're not the same as when we first began
We'll try to change, we'll take another chance
Maybe you and I could work it out
Maybe you and I can make it, this time we'll

[CHORUS]

I see your face, it's always on my mind
A time and palace we almost left behind
This time we'll fall in, this time we'll...

[CHORUS]
