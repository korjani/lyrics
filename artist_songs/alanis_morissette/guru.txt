I started young 
I was enthralled 
By your agape 
As a student 
I kept going 
Colour me captured
Disillusioned enough 
Needed your guidance 
And so I turned 
Over to you 
To lead me home

And then I said

Guru teacher 
Guruji I bow to you 
Humbled by your knowledgeable education 
Guruji I bow to the divine in you 
Please consider me your utmost humble student

And so I fell 
Under your spell 
I was enraptured 
Your every word 
I held onto 
‘Til it was gospel

You weren’t deterred 
From your asserts 
We’re identical 
I will admit 
I saw your face 
Inside my face

Guru teacher 
Guruji I bow to you 
Humbled by your knowledgeable education 
Guruji I bow to the divine in you 
Please consider me your utmost humble student

[Souleye Rap]

You had enough of subservience, and so you stopped me.
You saw my light seen as your light, gave it back to me.
I eventually saw that your jewel was in my pocket.
It had been there the whole time throughout my search.
And I finally saw...

Guru teacher 
Guruji I bow to you 
Humbled by your knowledgeable education 
Guruji I bow to the divine in you 
Please consider me your utmost humble student”

Guru teacher
Guruji I bow to you
Taken by your knowledgeable education
Guruji I bow to the divine in you
Thanks for pointing back to my inherent wisdom.
