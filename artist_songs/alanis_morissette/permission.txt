I’ve been a maze-girl offering much grumbling low and I gave all ...
All that was asked of me when order was so and vision was unrelenting
I never stop long enough to swim against the tides of old
And I was single minded too much to look toward this neutral love, so now

Permission to be, permission to slow
And do the only things that matter to me
The freedom to flow to where genuine flows
And do the only things that matter to me

And sure I’ve had my fun, played with my roles
With times for a break-heart one, but then after a while
So much done by road, no longer by inspiration

I never stopped long enough to see who’s was this blind ambition
And I was not sanctioned to stop and realize who’s was this omission

So now
Permission to be, permission to slow
And do the only things that matter to me
The freedom to flow to where genuine flows
And do the only things that matter to me

With this space
By the dropping of ways
This license to be
"with this time really we"
Ahhhh

So now
Permission to be permission to slow
And do the only things that matter to me
The freedom to flow to where genuine flows
And do the only things that matter to me.
Ohh...
The simple things that matter to me
Ohh...
The simple things that matter to me
Ohh...
The simple things that matter to me.
