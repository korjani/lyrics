Though today you might be riding 
The engines of progress
Working in the media factory 
Call me if you ever feel like letting go

And we'll remember the days of 
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Dynamo-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
Oh-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh

Swimming in the sound waves
Of the playback from the eight-track
I think your mind was born with water wings
And now when I see you
All our generation screams
I remember the dreams of
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Dynamo

Kid Dynamo - I remember you 
Kid Dynamo - The hours I spent with you
Kid Dynamo - 'Cause I invented you

All that we said
How media builds stars
And our minds won't change
Only our cars

Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo

Kid Dynamo, I remember you
Kid Dynamo - Because I speak of you
Kid Dynamo - 'Cause I invented you 
Kid Dynamo

Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
