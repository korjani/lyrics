Pogo Johnny kicked me in the head,
Aimin' for the floorboards but they picked me up instead 
Through the ringing of the night before 
Said the engine's running, gotta pay a call 

Johnny drove the halftrack 'cause we could not find the jeep 
Wake me in the morning, gotta get some sleep
Driving all night out of fear
Got it in the ribs every time I changed gear 

I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team 
Gonna go where we've never been 
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team 
(pickin' up, pickin' up the team)
God you know it's hard to keep the fighting clean 

Clean, clean
Clean, clean 
Clean, clean
Clean, clean

Pogo Johnny gonna fight the war 
Chaplain in the morning at the local liquor store 
Pogo coughin' bad from diesel fumes
Johnny tell the chaplain go and polish his tombs 

Lying on the wasteground with a blanket on his face 
Indicating that he's left the human race 
Helmet open where the world came in 
Gotta keep your head if you wanna win 

I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team 
Gonna go where we've never been 
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team 
(pickin' up, pickin' up the team)
God you know it's hard to keep the fighting clean

Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean

Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean

Lost a million in the very first attack 
Don't you worry cause we know we'll get them back 
Lost a million in the very first attack
Don't you worry cause we know we'll get them back
