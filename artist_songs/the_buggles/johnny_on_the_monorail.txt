Down, down, they pause and walk away
Even in the streets your feet don't move 
See their faces through the Perspex
Turn to stare back up at you 
You--your eyes are green and mine are blue 
In the subway darkness I am watching you 

Oh, my, my, you are so sci-fi,
Please will you let me ride?

Johnny, riding on the monorail
Johnny, riding on the monorail 
Monorail

You--you know that life is terminal,
It's the Paris Pullman in your mind again
Eyes like cameras move their lenses
Take this dream I offer you

Johnny, riding on the monorail 
Johnny, riding on the monorail
Johnny, riding on the monorail 

All we cannot see we call invisible 
Tracks that move on pylons through the sky 

Oh, my, my, you are so sci-fi 
Please will you let me ride?

Johnny riding on the monorail 
Johnny riding on the monorail 
Johnny riding on the monorail 

Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail (Johnny goes home...)
Johnny on the monorail (Johnny goes home...)
Johnny on the monorail
