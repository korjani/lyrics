Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail 
Monorail

Down, down to pause and walk away
Even in the streets your feet don't move
See their faces through the perspex
Turn to stare back up at you
You, your eyes are green and mine are blue
In the subway darkness I am watching you 

Oh my, my, you are so sci-fi,
Please will you let me ride?

Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Monorail

You, you know that life is terminal
It's the Paris Pullman in your mind again
Eyes like cameras move their lenses
Take this dream I offer you
All we cannot see we call invisible
Tracks that move like pylons through the sky

Oh my, my, you are so sci-fi
Please will you let me ride?

Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail
Jo-jo-jo-jo... riding on the monorail

Aaahh...
