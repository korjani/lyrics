When my VJ shoots the beam
I take my partner from the screen
And hold her close, I hold her close
One more chance to make it right
Holding hands in black and white
I’ll meet you there, I’ll meet you there
Leave my mind back in my room
Maybe I will blow it soon and fall in love

At the videotheque 
We can dance forever
At the videotheque 
We control it all
At the videotheque 
Ghosts are only lovers on the screen

Only pictures on the wall
They don’t mean a thing at all
And I don’t care
When the visions start to form
The same illusion takes us all
And you are there, you are there
Slowly senses leaving me
Once the two are in 3D, we play the game

At the videotheque 
We can dance forever
At the videotheque
We can fall in love
At the videotheque
Ghosts are only lovers on the screen

At the videotheque 
We can dance forever
At the videotheque
We can fall in love
At the videotheque
Ghosts are only lovers on the screen

At the videotheque
At the videotheque
At the videotheque
Ghosts are only lovers on the screen
