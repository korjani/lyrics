On some lonely motorway
I was forced to spend the day
Services--I stop the car
Restaurant and in the bar

I lie right back and turn the radio on

Now for major surgery
I'll be you and you'll be me
Wonder what was in her mind
Was I really so unkind

To lie right back and turn the radio on

Technopop
Technopop
Technopop

Can we settle out of court
Loyalty cannot be bought
Effortlessly changing gear
Maybe this will all end here

I lie right back and turn the radio on

Technopop
