All you ladies pop that thing like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't quit
All you ladies pop that thing like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't quit
Just do it, do it, do it now,do it good

Lick this, just like you should
Right now, Lick it good
Lick this just like you should
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that

My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that

First you gotta put your neck into it
Ah, don't stop, just do, do it
Then you roll your tongue, from the back up to the front
Then ya get it off, keep me up on ya
Make sure I keep my eyes on ya
All over the club and stuff
Real player show me so much love
The best love comes slow and long
Knows how to stay down on ya
All night 'till the crack of dawn
Real good, keep it comin' strong
Through the night, making so much love
In dead sleep when the sun comes up

So, lick it now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should
Right now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should

[Chorus]
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that

You might roll dubs, you might have G's
But so what player, get on your knees
A girl like me moans and screams
Thug misses know what I mean
At the club so fresh, so clean
Girls hatin' fellas watchin' me
Standin' out in the line, so clean
With a unit on my face, so mean
I gotta pick which fella I need
To take me out, spend his money on me
Try me I'll make you see
No other girl got nothin' me

So, lick it now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should
Right now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should

My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that

So, lick it now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should
Right now, lick it good
Lick this just like you should

My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that
My Neck, my back
Lick my ... just like that

[Chorus repeats x10]
