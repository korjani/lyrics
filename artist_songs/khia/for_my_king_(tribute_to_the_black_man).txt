when i meet my king 
it would be a beautiful thing
walking through the gates of heaven
seeing my mother again
like cooking naked in my heels 
smoking, fucking again
reppin' through the park steppin' doin' our thing
i'm lovin him
he's lovin' me
together chillin' and things

he's saying fuck them other hoes
my diamonds blinging and blinging
he's going out leading
