Last call for alcohol, the last bell done rang,
The fat lady done sang, so grab all your thangs;
Your shit packed already, you can't state no claim...
No more snacks, mothafucka - I ain't cooking no mo'!
Pick up your brown doggy bag on the way out the door.
Cause you's a man-ho, and that's not what I need;
I need a king, fuck nigga, much respect to his queen...
You's a nasty mothafucka, tryna flex for these hoes
You clueless, silly mothafucka, how could you be so dumb?
How could you be so weak? How could you be so lame?
How could I ever fuck with you in the first damn place?
My bad, I was wrong, I should have known all along
That you could never be the one and this was never your home...
I can do bad on my own, you know it's already on;
You broke the last straw - ah nigga, poof and be gone...
