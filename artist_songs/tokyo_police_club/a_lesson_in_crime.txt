My hands shake,
And they long to be held in the cold,
'Cause the winters are hell when it snows,
'til the bodies are covered in,
60 years of crime in my family,
Like my father and his before me,
Black cars and laundromats.

But they threw their hearts,
Into the sea,
Now they will beat forever,
With the bodies of their enemies,

'Cause they threw their hearts,
Into the sea,
Now they will beat forever,
With the bodies of their enemies,

Ive been told,
That the worlds greatest heist will unfold,
When the clock strikes 12 and it tolls,
This time don't stand a chance,
In my room,
And the father is at the door,
His heir and the next crime lord,
My hands long to be held,

Oh, oh, oh
