I threw darts at a spinning globe
Swapping out passport photos
I walk west to the setting sun
Every single step, I grow
Another second young

All my hair grows in
Wrinkles leave my skin
But still, don't fade
I'll be back again when the tide is in some day

I don't know who else to ask
Sitting in the dark, filling an empty glass
Stained my teeth with more red wine
I'm a romantic
But never pearly white

All my hair grows in
Wrinkles leave my skin
But still, don't fade
I'll be back again when the tide is in some day

Elephant shell,
You're my cave and I've been hiding out
Will you tell me a little bit about
A bit about yourself?
