We've got our tracks covered
Thanks to your older brother
It's not the moonlight that sets me off
It's not the money that makes me scoff

It's my impeccable disorder
Where I keep on falling for her
It's not the way my mother talks
It's not the people that she mocks

It's the nature of the experiment
It's the patterns of my temperment
It's the nature of the experiment
They're taking me in increments

We're halfway up the bracket
The rain comes through my jacket
It's not the stones inside my shoes
It's not the risk of what's to lose

It's an ancient Russian proverb
But I doubt it's ones that you've heard
It's not the cracks beneath the floor
It's not the fact that it's a chore

It's the nature of the experiment
It's the patterns of my temperment
It's the nature of the experiment
They're taking me in increments
