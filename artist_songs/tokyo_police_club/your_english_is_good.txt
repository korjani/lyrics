Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote
If you know what's good for you
Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote
If you know what's good for you

These are the lines
That we straighten every year
But it's the second time
They mapped the constellations
So we search for you by night
In the Deptford gravel pit
Until the tramp finds Christ
Injustice is my middle name

'cause you don't need to change
Your future's with us
You don't need to change
Your future's with us

You look a wreck
Left your key inside the door
And my rook will check
Across this black and white chessboard
'cause your English is good
We can see it in your bones
In this neighborhood
We ain't driving you home

'cause you don't need to change
Your future's with us
You don't need to change

Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote

'cause your English is good
We can see it in your bones
