Once I was the keeper of a secret surprise but now it’s gone away,
Every time you look into the darks of my eyes I always look away.

Cause in my mind you don’t know where I live,
Though one day your hand will be on my door and you’ll give it a twist,
And my heart will stop and I'll lay where I stood,
And I hope that you dialed the ambulance as fast as you could.

Of course you are a winner and triumph of the town but all nonsense aside,
Ill always be the way that you remember me now, the way that you remember me best.

Cause in my mind you don’t know where I live,
But one day your hand will be on my door and you will give it a twist,
And my heart will stop and I'll lay where I stood,
And I hope that you dialed the ambulance as fast as you could,
As fast as you should.
