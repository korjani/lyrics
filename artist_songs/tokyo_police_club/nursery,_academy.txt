I would've gone back home
I would've gone back home
It's bad enough you're here
And it's worse that you've come along

Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect
The house that built a home for architects

Now that you're all grown up
I know a shortcut back
Welcome to your new home
Welcome to the nursery

We keep keys on strings
Doorknobs out of reach
Come a little closer
Forget the Academy

Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect
The house that built a home for architects
Because the word on the street is
That you've got a weakness
Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect

I would've gone back home
I would've gone back home
It's bad enough you're here
And it's worse that you've come along

Because the word on the street is
That you've got a weakness
Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect

I would've gone back home
(Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect)
I would've gone back home
The house that built a home for architects

I would've gone back home
(Paper walls unfold, as you'd expect)
I would've gone back home
The house that built a home for architects
