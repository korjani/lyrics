[Rowdy Rebel:]
All in my Birk, little jerk
Watch me jugg and flex, don't it hurt?
They mad 'cause we all in, in our Birk
They mad 'cause we pull up, our cars skkrt
Posted with some stars on the Birk'
Bitch I'm in my bag all in my Birk'
Post up on the fifth, not the first
Bitch I'm rolling hard, watch a nigga surf
Shootouts broad day on my turf
They think they gon' catch me from my birth
Bitch I put all my shooters to work
They don't come back til' bodies is in the dirt
Bitch you get that work
Bend your block all on your curb
Hit that pussy first, I defend my little bird
Bobby pistol burst, when we brrt, nigga chirp
Bitch we make it work, Littles hit that bitch Birk

Bitch close the curtains, we in our Birken, swaggin' perfect
That Birken, that little Birken that I just purchased
That lil' bitch that was just talking shit, not even worth it
Tryna suck my dick, watch me curve it
Birken, I'm in my Birken, in my Birken
Birken, I'm in my Birken, in my Birken
Give me all that cash and I splurged it
Brand new swag, in my Birken

[Corey Finesse:]
Corey in is bag, nah that boy in his Birk
Homegirl just kick them works, and watch me make them work
I cash out like the first, this shmoney make her twerk
She talking 'bout a purse, man that bitch got some nerve
She she a nigga flexing, now Corey he finessing
He balling like he carefree, now Rowdy that's his bredrin
That's Rowdy, that's a [?]
She said I got a question, I said just send them heads in
She got the wrong impression, I leave these bitches guessing
I'm always on the work, I'm always on the road
Ain't no accounts get froze, that shit was kaka show
Bitch everything a go, shit everything is old
Don't lurk and call my phone, my shmurdas up them poles
A nigga in his Birken, they know that I go hard
They know that I crack cards, they know I'm the Zoe God
Finesse her out her drawers, fuck all these foreign broads
Finesse her out her car, skkrt off in foreign cars
