[TeeFlii:]
She say I do it like he never did it, yeah
When he gone, that's when she calling me up to visit
Because I make her get it
I have her saying ooh
We in the living room like ooh
We in the kitchen like ooh
Bend her over on the counter
Now she groaning like ooh
We in the bedroom like ooh
And then we in the bedroom like ooh

[Rowdy Rebel:]
Bet he don't do it like I do
Beat that pussy up, you know how Rowdy do it
Making babies under these covers
A little body might pop out that little stomach
So I put kisses on my little baby
Before I take a trip up in little [?]
We can do whatever you wan' do
[?] just swear to keep it cool, you can be my lady
Drop top, brand new Mercedes
It's Rowdy's time to visit when he feeling lazy
Girl we gon' fuck up this room
He don't do it like I do
He ain't goin' [?] karate baby

[TeeFlii:]
She say I do it like he never did it, yeah
When he gone, that's when she calling me up to visit
Because I make her get it
I have her saying ooh
We in the living room like ooh
We in the kitchen like ooh
Bend her over on the counter
Now she groaning like ooh
We in the bedroom like ooh
And then we in the bedroom like ooh

[Abillyon:]
Little shorty know she fine, and I wanna make her mine
I see a fatal collision from [?] down to her spine
Wanna see her all the time, I just wanna make her smile
Baby girl give me a hug cause I ain't seen you in a while
Not unless she pick that phone up, we ain't ever going out
Every time she said we grown ups, and your head full of doubts
She said she make it feel so good to me
She said she hoping I would stay
And I would play
So come on won't you slide to me
But fuck it, she gon' glide to me

[TeeFlii:]
She say I do it like he never did it, yeah
