Bitch that shmoney keep on calling, bitch I got to go
Adios, bitch I'm gone, next stop Mexico
Touchdown on that work, bitch I'm Plaxico

At LA, call up Chi Money, tell him bring that smoke
Call that nigga Rob Dank, I need Cali smoke

Head back to Mexico, with two sexy hoes
Touchdown on that work, bitch I'm Plaxico
This a no flex zone, bitch we vagabonds
My [?] bitch it's Gaga show
Don't matter where we go, we tuck that 44
Tuck that beam jawn, drop that body-o

Finessing foreign hoes, once that shmoney gone

Bitch that shmoney keep on calling, bitch I got to go
Adios, bitch I'm gone, next stop Mexico
Touchdown on that work, bitch I'm Plaxico
Touchdown on that work, bitch I'm Plaxico
