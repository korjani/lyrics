I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Skkrt skkrt, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Skkrt
Fuck up Audemars, take down all the stores, I just wanna ball
Drive all them fancy cars
I just wanna ball
To see the echelon
Can't fuck with her no more
Kick her out the car
Cause I just wanna ball

I don't need no god
I just need a bitch to suck my dick and make a nigga's toes curl
I took your bitch to the motherland and introduced her to the world
Pay a nigga just to take her diamonds, just to find my baby's pearls
Cause bitch I came to ball
This ain't a vacation, there's no days off
This ain't hard work, go and pay off
I'm in ATL with my Migo niggas
Getting booted up, bout to take off
My chicken take a nigga face off
Pussy nigga it won't take long
Superman with no cape on
Tell Quano he don't take long

I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Skkrt skkrt, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Skkrt
Fuck up Audemars, take down all the stores, I just wanna ball
Drive all them fancy cars
I just wanna ball
To see the echelon
Can't fuck with fuck with her no more
Kick her out the car
Cause I just wanna ball

[2 Milly:]
Trapping hard with my niggas, tryna make 100 M's
I'm trapping hard with my niggas, tryna whip a new Benz
That nigga's a fraud, he don't get no paper, don't fuck with him
It's a hundred racks in these Balmain's, I just stuff it in
I just wanna ball
When it's game time we ball on em, hop out the foreign car
Shoot him, watch him fall
On any block with his semi Glock
Police is who they call
I'm screaming fuck em all
Middle finger to the law
From the stop blocks to the nine blocks
Nigga we just need it all
First the Rolex, then the Cuban links
Nigga we need them Audemars
Bitch you looking at a star
All them niggas frauds
Need 100 M's in 100 days
I just wanna ball
