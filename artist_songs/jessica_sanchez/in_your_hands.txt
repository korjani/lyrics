Baby stay with me
Let me know that you'll never leave
You don't have to be alone
Take my heart and let it be your own

Cause I can't promise I'll be waiting
If your mind might be changing
Don't let this opportunity
Just linger, when we're meant to be

Stay with me, take my hand
Cause together we can stay
I'm on my way, both wings out stretched
If you don't come with me

I know you'll regret it
You'll never forget it
Just how good we had it
So baby don't you let this go

You better start believing
Oh yes we're gonna make it
Why live your life wondering
When you can have the whole world in your hands

So much love inside these arms
But tomorrow it could be gone
And I can see our future in your eyes
Trust your heart and ease your mind

So don't you worry, I'm not too much
'Cause I love you - hush!
All that matters in the end is
We've got love and understanding

Stay with me, take my hand
And together we can stand
'Til we're on our way, our wings out stretched
Come with me cause I know

I know you'll regret it
You'll never forget it
Just how good we had it
So baby don't you let this go

You better start believing
Oh yes we're gonna make it
Why live your life wondering
When you can have the whole world in your hands

If you're having second-thoughts I would understand
Cause sometimes it's too much, too soon
And we don't even have a plan
But all I know is that what you feel for me is true
So no matter what you choose to do, it'll always be
Me and you

Cause I can't promise I'll be waiting
If your mind might be changing
Don't let this opportunity
Just linger, when we're meant to be

Stay with me, take my hand
Cause together we can stay
I'm on my way, both wings out stretched
If you don't come with me

I know you'll regret it
You'll never forget it
Just how good we had it
So baby don't you let this go

You better start believing
Oh yes we're gonna make it
Why live your life wondering
When you can have the whole world in your hands

When you can have the whole world in your hands
When you can have the whole world in your hands
