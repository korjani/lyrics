Lonely nights and empty rooms
It's just me and a picture of you
No one compares
No one compares

Young wild girl across the bar
She wanna kiss in the dark
But no one compares
No one compares

She could follow me around
And play me close
Still it's you I want the most
Cause no one compares
No
No one compares
No one, no

A thousand days could pass us by
But you would still be on my mind
Cause no one compares
No one compares
To you

No oh oh oh one
No oh oh oh one
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Sometimes your mind plays tricks
Your heart might cry
Yes you might even catch my eye
But no one compares
No one compares
No one compares

I could find my way to paradise
But it won't be worth the ride
Cause no one compares
No one compares

They could hold their numbers in my face
They could cast a spell, adjust our fate
But you know that I'm yours
I know

Sometimes it's the simple things
That prove our love was meant to be
So don't worry, don't worry
Cause no one compares
And no one compares
No one compares
To you

No oh oh oh one
No oh oh oh one
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Young wild girl across the bar
I left her right at the door
Cause no one compares
Yeah, no one compares

Hotel room and candlelight
Imagine you by my side
Cause no one compares
Yeah, no one compares
To you
