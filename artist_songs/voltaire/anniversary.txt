Do I look the same to you? 
Cause I don't feel so
You know everything must change 
As time goes by
Though it feels like yesterday 
When we first met
I feel I'm sinking deeper

Do you look the same to me? 
Well I don't think so
Cause you know everything must change 
As time goes by
Like the flowers that dry
Locking inside
Forever their beauty
Beauty

And they said this feeling fades
It gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

Well I stumble through the dark 
And light a candle
And the path the wax will take
No one can know
And you said it looked like snow
Or maybe clouds,
and I think it looks like Heaven

So we make it into a ring 
And make a mold
And we melt above the flames 
The whitest gold
When hot and cold collide 
What's left in place
Is forever and ever

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

Some say things worth having 
Take some time
As they get older 
They get better

La lalala lalalala...

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades—
You're more beautiful than ever

They said we'd drift away
Well as long as we're together
It feels like every day's
Our Anniversary
