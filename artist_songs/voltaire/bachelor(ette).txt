You're a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
I'm the bird on the brim
Hypnotized by the whirl
I drink you- make you feel real
Wet my beak in your stream
The game we're playing is life
Love's a two way dream

Leave me now - return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

You're a path of cinders 
Burning under my feet
I'm the one who walks you
You're my one way street

You're a whispering water
A secret for me to hear
I'm the one who grew distant
When you beckoned me near

Leave me now - return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

You're a tree that grows hearts
One for each that I take
I'm the ground that you beat on
You're the branch that I break

And life is a necklace of tears 
You undo them with your fear
And I am a fountain of fears
You fill me with your tears

Our love
Is a big ball of string
Devil collects it with a grin
Our love
