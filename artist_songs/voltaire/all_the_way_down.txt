The sun goes down while children listen,
All the way down.
Black as a crow is the space in which you,
Leave me standing.
All the way down.
If you'd seen the light of day,
I'd hold you there tonight.
And if you'd seen the light we'd go,
All the way down.

Up there in space,
You're looking down on us,
Looking all the way down.
And if you fell to Earth, 
They have a name they call it, they say, 
"All the way down."
If you burned your wings and fell into my arms,
You know I wouldn't mind being,
All the way down.

I can't believe in Hell,
But I've got to believe in Heaven.
I wouldn't sleep at night not knowing,
That you were somewhere better.

If you burned your wings and fell into my arms,
You know I wouldn't mind being,
All the way down,
All the way down,
All the way down.
