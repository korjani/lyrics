Here, on the slab I awake
And I'm freezing
There is a light up ahead
And I rise and float through the air
Through a tunnel
Now the light's up ahead

Here, in a bullring I stand
Am I dreaming?
There is a bull up ahead
And I laugh, 'Ha ha ha'
I get it, I'm dead
And this whole charade's
A fight for my soul
Red-eyed fiend
Lunges I turn while
Skeletal picadores
Stab away at the beast

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay
I lay my eyes on the Devil
Oh fate, once again I lay
I lay, I lay, I lay

There in the stands something grabs
My attention
Like it is calling to me
It's a girl with eyes like the sea
Is she an angel sent to watch over me?

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay
I lay my eyes on the Devil
Oh fate, once again I lay
I lay, I lay, I lay

Suddenly I remember
The girl with eyes like the sea
I turn, she winks and she smiles gently
While the bull runs straight into me

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay
I lay my eyes on the Devil
'Blue-eyed matador', I cried
I fell for your wicked disguise
