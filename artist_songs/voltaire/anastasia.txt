There's a field of flowers and they smell like you 
And I go walking through them when I feel you remember me
You know I'd love to pick one for my lapel, but you know
there are too many insects watching
I'm afraid they'd tell on me

And here the skies are neither day nor night
In this place where I close my eyes
It's like my skin would try so hard to hold it back
There's an explosion, it comes raining down 
You smiled, you smiled at me

Anastasia
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side
Anastasia
You know your absence is the thorn in my side

I think about you every night and every day
Every moment since you left here
You were the one that got away as they say
Everyone has an Anastasia

Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side
Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
You know your absence is the thorn in my side

I kept your room just how you left it
There's not a toy out of place
Just in case the fates are kind and you come back someday
I don't want to live without my little Anastasia

Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side
Little Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
You know your absence is the thorn in my side

Little Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side
Little Anastasia
(I know you're out there, ah)
And only you can take the thorn from my side
