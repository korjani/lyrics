Monday, time for Alchemy
I'm buried behind the gallery
Come in and see a band
From Norway or Japan
Pick up the CD while you're able
Some are on a tiny German label

Miss Gothic NYC
Hey, save a dance for me
And do deposit if you please
Some black lipstick on my peepee

Monday time for alchemy
So come in and have a pint
There's a hideous man named Mike
And a bunch of gothic tykes
And George at the bar with his fake fangs on
And hold everything, they're playing my song
"It gets so lonely being evil"

It's Monday night again
So pull up a chair my friend
And Jason and Althea
Will be oh so glad to see ya
Don't get cake on your velvet cape
Here at Alchemy Mondays
