You set the snakes loose inside my belly
They're done with my supper
they start on my endocrine lining
You said, "Please, stop your whining!"

This isn't a love song
I'm through writing those for you
All the while you claimed
the ghost in you lives, but it's dead
It's inside my head
And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called

Oh when you sigh, and you cry
I figure you probably lie and I'm here waiting
And all I can see, if there's anyone fooled
then it's probably me
And I'm here waiting

And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called
All that I see is that it's midnight
and you haven't called.
All that I know is I'm left with frustration
and this hyperactive imagination of mine

I would love to lay all my faith in you
Why can't I let fate have it's way with me?
I would love to but...

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over!

You say you're at mother's but do you mean LOVERS?
Are you in the amorous arms of another?
It chills every bone in me, straight to the core of me
Your girlfriend concurs with you, is she your alibi?
How did you get that sweet little girl to lie?
Meanwhile I'm here waiting

And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called
All that I see is that it's midnight
and you haven't called.
All that I know is I'm left with frustration
and this hyperactive imagination of mine

I would love to place all my faith in you
Why can't I let fate have it's way with me?
I would love to place all my trust in you
Why can't I? 'cause..

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over again!

This isn't a love song
I'm through writing those for you
All the while you claimed
that the ghost in you lives, but it's dead
and it's inside my head
And all that I know is it's midnight
and you haven't called
