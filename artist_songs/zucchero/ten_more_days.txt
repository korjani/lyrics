Ten more days on the water
And I already know
I’ll be fine

Ten more days ’til it’s over
‘Til the darkness goes
And I see the light

I’m torn between
fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me

And a grounded love
that raises me high above
The grabbing hands
of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days ’til I’m awake
Ten more days ’til I don’t have to fight

I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right

You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I’m strong enough
To take the tides

The bed, it trembles beneath me
But wherever the road is rough you know I’ll rise

I’m torn between
fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me

And a grounded love
that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days ’til I’m awake
Ten more days ’til I don’t have to fight

I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right
