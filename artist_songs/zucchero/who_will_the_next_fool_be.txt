After you get rid of me
who will the next fool be?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things he'd like to know about the girl that I love so.

'Cause after all is said and done
You wont be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?

Will he believe all those lies?
End up like me with tears in his eyes
I know, I know, I know, I know
And I'd like to be the one to tell him so.

'Cause after all is said and done
You wont be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?

Will he believe all those lies
End up like me with tears in his eyes
I know, I know, I know, I know
I'd like to be the one to tell him so.

'Cause after all is said and done
You wont be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?
