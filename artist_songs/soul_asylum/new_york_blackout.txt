When you chew my ear off, try and let me know 
You will never get another piece of me 
Cause in a New York blackout, things go kinda slow 
And you miss the things you never thought you'd see 
There's still so many things I want to be 
Sometimes I just don't even want to sleep 
In a New York blackout, it's so hard to see 
All the angels that are looking after me 
The lies bounce off the water in your eyes 
And the dead lift their heads and come alive 
And I may never escape this darkened city 
But still I'm trying to find you in this blackout 
Where it's warm inside and always open late 
And the doors to hell look just like heaven's gate 
And you never know what's going on inside 
'Til you step out in the cold and seal your fate 
And you might just stop in and say hello 
But you've got much more important places to go 
Make sure you let everybody know 
That I may never enlight this darkened city 
Still I'm trying to find you in this blackout 
In a New York blackout, you might think I'm gone 
But I'll wake up on the front steps of your door
