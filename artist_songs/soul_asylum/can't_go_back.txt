The aim of my time is to fill up my mind
And when it gets too full I forget
Now if I'm late and I'm making you wait
Then there ain't one thing around that's even funny

Seein' things clearly and I thank you so dearly
Everything's so true to life when you're not living
When it's all a drag that's when you give it all the way
put it all in bags, just call it charity

You just can't go back
You just can't go back
Everybody's going their own way
Each one is gonna make his day
It's more than amusement now
You're just killing time

(Just killing time) You just can't go back
(Just killing time) You just can't go back
(Just killing time) You just can't go back

Fifteen years later caught in time's incinerator
Yesterday's worries are today's
But the good times are so near just sitting back and drinking beer
You know I'm halfway down the road but I know that I still ain't there

Seeing things clearly I thank you so dearly
Everything's so true to life when you're not living
When it's all a drag that's when you give it all the way
put it all in bags, just call it charity

You just can't go back
(Just killing time) You just can't go back
Everybody's going their own way
Each one is gonna make his day
It's more than amusement now
You're just killing time
