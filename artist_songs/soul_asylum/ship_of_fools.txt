Shipwreck sailors searching for some fools gold
They're the local drunken boys
Been out drinking all night feeling alright
We watch them kill each other in a fight

Ship of fools, drunken hearts
Making yet another new start
Ain't it hard to play that part
When you've got a drunken heart

I can't change the world by complaining
You can't change it with a kiss
(Be no?) concentrating contemplating
No time to find out what we miss

Ship of fools ...
