Early one morning while making my rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down and then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' Forty-four beneath my head

Late the next morning I grabbed my gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
I made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down is Juarez, Mexico

I was in the hot joint takin the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown.
"You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down."

Yes, so my name is Willy Lee
If you got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They stuck me on a freight train and they hauled me back
I had no friend to throw my bail
So they stuck my dried up carcas in the county jail

The next morning bout half past nine
I saw a sheriff walking down the line
The sheriff said as he cleared his throat
"Comon you dirty hack into the district court."

The next morning my trial began
Where I was judged by twelve honest men
And as the jury started walking out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In bout five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict said in the first degree
I cried, Oh lord, please have mercy on me

The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
"Ninety nine years in the San Quentin Penn!"
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I wont forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Comon you hotheads listen up to me
Stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be...
