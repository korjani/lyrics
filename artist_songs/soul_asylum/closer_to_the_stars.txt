Caterpillar crawling up the big phone pole
Is there somebody that you want to talk to?
You know that pretty soon you'll be able to fly
How is this going to affect you?
Do you think it might wreck you?
Your friends might reject you
Say you took it too far
You said you want to be want to be want to be want to be

Hooked on glossy pictures and drugs I've never seen
We'll treat you with advice from a fashion magazine
One day she just walked into that magazine
I wonder if she'll ever come back
And they all said she would crack
They said her mind was one track,
Said she took it too far
You said you want to be want to be want to be want to be
Closer to the stars

Every time you move your lips
Let me give you a few tips
Yesterday you were too young
Tomorrow you will be too old
To regret all the things you've done who're you trying to hustle ?
Somebody you wanna show your muscle?
Second hand excuses never went too far
What's this scene you're making?
Your ideas have been taken
We'll seek when you awaken alone in someone's car
You just stood there shaking, stood there shaking
They said you were faking

You said you want to be want to be want to be want to be
Closer to the stars
Closer to the stars
