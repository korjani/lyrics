Black lights and a disco ball
Cut the carpets going wall to wall
Maybe someday won't be just one way
Had a dream I was laying in hell
Looked a lot like this hotel
Maybe one day, won't be just one way
But it's one big maybe
And maybe I'm the one who's crazy
How can I find out,
How can I wonder,
Trying to be like you.

And all is well in hell,
I wish you were here,
I wishing you well.
You know who asked about you
As far as I can tell
all in all, all is well.

A bomb shelter and some cans of food
A gas mask looks good on you
Come and see me
Ya wouldn't wanna be me
I think I injured my funny bone
I'm gonna cry when I get home
Maybe one day, save it for someday.
But it's one big maybe
And maybe I'm the one who's crazy
How can I find out,
How can I wonder,
Trying to be like you.

And all is well in hell
I wish you were here,
I wishing you well.
You know who asked about you
As far as I can tell
All in all, all is well.
All is well......

All is well, here in hell
I wish you were here,
I wishing you well.
All is well, here in hell!
I wish you were here,
All in all, all is well.
All in all, all is well.
All in all, all is well!
