Rise and shine it's you're razor sharp. 
Size up yourself in the mirror, a slice of life, 
To last through all the years, because sooner or later it all comes back to you, 
And we will remember, the fine things you can do. 
I'm giving back all the things that you gave to me. 
I'm saving up the price to pay to be free. 
Remember the first time you saw the rising sun. 
You may be done but I've just begun. 
The leaves are burning and the ashes have flown away. 
I'm turning over new leaves almost every day. 
You let him think you just as soon stay - you let him think you had nothing to say. 
Just let you go away, to find some mangled security, some strangled form of purity, 
To restore your faith and all the things you've come to hate. 
You give and you take and you leave, leave it alone. 
What i want so badly for this to be a place you can call home, and I haven't felt this 
Way since yesterday, but I don't remeber when. 
What I want so badly to be someone you can call a friend, till we meet again. 
Endless Farewell. Hello, Hello, Hello again. Endless Farewell.
