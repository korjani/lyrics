When aid turned sideways 
And It'd head on down the highway 
Say this is my way, disappearing forever 
But there ain't just one way 
So you choose the fun way 
Slide down the runway 
On a ticket that goes two ways 
And by the way that it sounded 
You thought that you'd be astounded 
But you left it like you found it 
Cause it wasn't yours to take 
What once seemed like dying 
Soon turned into flying 
So you settle for trying 
And you wish you were grounded 
No you cannot get much higher 
Than your utmost desire 
So you bring it down to size and 
Now it seems that you are grounded 
By the way that it sounded 
You thought that you'd be astounded 
But you left it like you found it 
Now you find that you are grounded
