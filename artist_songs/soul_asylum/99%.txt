I don't own you but I know you're mine
Never disown you, never treat you unkind

But once in a while, you get on my nerves
Once in a while, you get what you deserve
I need you ninety-nine percent of the time
Ninety-nine percent of the time [x3]

If I asked you what's on your mind
Would you say me, would they be thoughts unkind

But once in a while, I'm not myself
Once in a while, I think you're someone else
I want you ninety-nine percent of the time
Ninety-nine percent of the time [x3]

Let's move in together
Happily ever after

I can't touch you but you feel so fucking fine
Let's just stay like this and waste some more time

Once in a while, you get in my way
Once in a while, you know I've got to say
I love you ninety-nine percent of the time
Ninety-nine percent of the time [x3]
