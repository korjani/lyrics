Long distance information, ring me 608
Laughing at the other end
get me my prescription, come and walk my dog
please get me anything

You can't seal fate with a kick
You should know it doesn't work that way
As for your lofty aspirations
You couldn't give them all away (throw away)

Those precious things that just don't last (throw away)
Everybody's been cut like broken glass

Long distance information sounds like broken glass

Just how long is all of this really gonna last
Get someone I used to know
In another place of time
Please please me

You've been places I'll never go
Begged the questions I'll never know
You've had so many arms around you
This time you've hit an all-time low

So many things just don't last
So many things like broken glass
