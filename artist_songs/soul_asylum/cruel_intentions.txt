Cruel intentions, harbored for thee
Too few to mention, but not too hard to see
Crude inventions and mysterious schemes
I need prevention now
Do you see that it's true
All you care about is you
Baby thats cruel
So save your cruel intentions for somebody other than me

Sweet pretentions, so cute and in style
Sales potential, yes I'd walk a mile
Unholy places and so much to see
I need a replacement now
Do you see that it's true
Your whole world spins around you
Baby thats cruel
So save your cruel intentions for somebody other than me

Cruel intentions, harbored for thee
Too few to mention, but do you see that it's true
Your whole world spins around you
Baby thats cruel
So save your cruel intentions for somebody other than me

So save your cruel intentions for somebody other than me
