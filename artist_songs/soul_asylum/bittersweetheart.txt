Why you always want to get the best of me 
I'm like a seeing-eye dog and I can't even see 
They're naked and they're following my master who is blind 
And my mind's gone to pieces, I could use some piece of mind 
So I picked up the pieces and I made a new start 
Stole an old stiletto, started stabbing in the dark 
I can't live without it, I would surely fall apart 
But it's hard to make arrangements 'round a bittersweetheart 
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart 
Better get yourself a little street smart 
Bittersweetheart, sad but true 
It's a bittersweetheart that's a hard heart to cure 
It's just my bittersweetheart 
It's like a suicide mission when you can't see no end 
Tired of compliment-fishing and impressing your friends 
I never kissed no one just to kiss and tell 
It's a little bit of heaven and a whole lot of hell 
In the eye of the beholder is a beautiful start 
But you always seem to end up with a bittersweetheart 
There's a darkness looming but the sun is shining bright 
I can live to see the morning if I stay up all night 
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart 
Without a shortcut, without a head-start 
Bittersweetheart, sad but true 
It's a bittersweetheart that's a hard heart to cure 
My bittersweetheart it's the hardest part 
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart 
Are you in there, are you beating 
Beating me up until I'm bleeding 
How much blood can you spare 
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart 
Think just a drink might get you to the good part 
Lyin' in bed just a'wonderin' what to do, 
It's a bittersweetheart that'a a hard heart to cure 
In time inside you find you always wind up with a bittersweetheart
