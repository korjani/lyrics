At the end of the track is a shack 
When you die, that's where you go 
Down the lines, up from this pit at the end of your rainbow 
That's one too many flights of stairs 
One more stair and almost there 
One more dose close 
Keep coming back to haunt you, 
Got no place left to go 
And they'll strip your car to the bone 
We did a scene, checked out a gown 
The Justice started laughing 
I guess that's what you get for laughing 
One last laugh and lived to tell 
One more pomp and circumstance 
One more fool to follow 
Another finger down my throat 
It's a bitter pill to swallow 
It's moving much too slow 
Who it is asleep at the wheel 
I don't want to know 
Just around the corner there's 
Somebody there to take you there 
Don't worry child you're sure to be scared 
One more drink before I go 
One last good luck kiss 
One less thing to call my own 
That's one more thing I miss 
Took the world by storm 
Most of 'em either in a dark jail 
Or wishing they had never been born 
Just around the corner there's 
One more pomp and circumstance 
One more fool to follow 
Another finger down my throat 
That's a bitter pill to swallow
