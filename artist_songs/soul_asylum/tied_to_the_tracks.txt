What are you doing here in my nightmare? (In my nightmare)
Stepping back into the stupidness gets me nowhere (Gets me nowhere)

Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell
Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well
Look at you now - All those stories and there's no one to tell
Look at you now
Do you think you can find a place for your dreams in my nightmares?
And you're tied to the tracks but the train broke down

Wake me up and let me go (from) somebody I used to know
From somewhere in my nightmare.
Don't you remember the years we got nowhere? (We got nowhere)

Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell
Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well

Look at you now - All those stories and there's no one to tell
Look at you now
Do you think you can find a place for your dreams in my nightmares?
And you're playing with a different joker, but there's always one more sucker
And you're tied to the tracks but the train broke down
Trapped at the top of the merry-go-round
But it won't let you down.

Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell
Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well
Look at you now - All those stories and there's no one to tell
Look at you now
Do you think you can find a place for my dreams?
