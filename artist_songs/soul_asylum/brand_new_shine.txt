I got something special to show you 
But I suppose you've seen it all before 
There's one thing I'm trying to tell you 
But then again, you've heard it all before 
I survived another week just like the one before, 
When everything you wanted somehow leaves you wanting more 
And I looked beneath the carpet behind each and every door, 
Trying to find you something like you've never had before 
And it seems we're just beginners 
No previous experience at all 
Just the last original sinners 
And if you need me just be sure to call 
And they tell you which way not to go and so you go that way 
One child plays with another throws it away 
Like a kite without string do anything 
I'm trying to take you someplace you've never been before 
I see something new in each and every moon 
From your old, old hat to your blown-out shoes 
It's tried and true, and it's all I do 
And I hope it's not all the same to you 
The old and new, they get mistaken all the time 
Is there something I've never seen before 
No, just a brand new shine 
Now they're cranking 'em out by the millions 
They look and act exactly just the same 
And each one's one in a million 
And each has got its own elusive game 
It's the same old dusty atmosphere just like the other place 
I see something familiar in each and every face 
Seems to me I've seen you, been here, said this once before 
I'm trying to take you someplace you've never been before 
I see something new in each and every moon 
From your old, old hat to 
When I dropped it and broke it, I thought of you 
And I hope it's not all the same to you 
And the old and new, they get mistaken all the time 
Is there something I've never seen before
