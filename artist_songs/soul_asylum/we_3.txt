I was tapping my foot on a Friday night 
To my favorite band I was pushed aside 
I said "hey don't push me no one pushes me" 
When I was face to face with the woman I admired 
And she gave me this look I could not believe 
And the cold stare remained; I wanted to leave 

See, I do believe anger is offset by sorrow 
But you destroy today you might regret tomorrow 
When you're young and defensive it comes off offensive 
And it's hard to repay the tolerance that you borrowed 
The lasting relationship sinks right off the pier 
Who wears the pants; it's faded but clear 

She's your girlfriend, seems she ain't too fond of me 
I guess if that's the way it was meant to be 
There we were, just we three 
You, your girlfriend, and me 

I've known you forever, you two just met 
So easily amused; how fast we forget 
In my jealously, my self-righteous greed 
She's a bit like a book I'm too far sighted to read 
And I wish you the best, I sometimes feel the need 
To say remember me 

She's your girlfriend, as far as we can see 
Does she look at you the way she looks at me 
And here we are, just we three 
You, your girlfriend, and me 

She's your girlfriend, it's getting harder to see 
Better just take her home, better just let her be 
When she walks out that door, you'll come looking for me
