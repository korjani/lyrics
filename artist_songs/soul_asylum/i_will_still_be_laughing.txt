Doorways open up and close more ways to a punchline 
They're all laughing at your clothes, standing in the lunch line 
You're the talk of the town cause you're up and you're down 
It's a cycle, I've found, it always comes around 

But I will still be laughing 
Yes I will still be laughing 

Air raids in the afternoon, the children are playing 
Switchblades, colored red balloons, no one hears your praying 
And it comes back to you, all the things that you do 
Will come looking for you, will come looking for you 

But I will still be laughing 
Yes I will still be laughing 

Doorways lead to other rooms, always leave you lying 
Face down in a stranger's tomb, didn't know you were dying 
And you rise and you fall, and you wait for the call 
You're watching the walls, you're watching the walls 

But I will still be laughing 
I will still be laughing 

Yes I will still be laughing 
I will still be laughing
