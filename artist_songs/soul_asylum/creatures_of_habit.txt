If the day wants to begin, you can let the day in 
If the darkness has no end, light up the darkness 
It ain't on what you can depend, it's who you can depend on 
If the rain wants to come in, you can let the rain in 
If the darkness is your friend, you can hold the darkness 
And if it ain't what you got, you know you gotta have it 
The grass gets greener all the time for creatures of habit 
Look out, here comes one more morning 
Habits form without a warning 
Love it can be habit-forming 
Make your enemies your friends, and leap standing naked 
It ain't how much you can take, it's how you take it 
Look out, here comes one more morning 
Habits form without a warning 
Love it can be habit-forming for creatures of habit 
Look out, a habit's forming 
It's just one more morning 
For creatures of habit
