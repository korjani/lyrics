Lives in a little lonely town
No one's around except for the drinking
Nobody even gets around
But those who leave the township sinking
May you rot in heaven
Gotta be home by seven

And the fields burns away
The sky breathes it in
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin

I'm comin' out across your border
With new orders for you to take
I'd really like to take out your daughter
Down by the water down by the lake
When cold water's on her skin
I can feel how long it's been

And the neighbours will all be there
And no one will know what to wear
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin

I got a lot I gotta do
Just to get through the end of the day
It hardly ever happens
But I go to sleep the same anyway

And you can't believe in yourself
You can't believe in anyone else
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin
