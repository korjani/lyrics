Just like an old man in a candy store, the riots across the street 
The cold greets the newborn, the neighbors that never meet 
No one's making plans here, no one knows for sure 
The way to keep it inside, it's just one more dark opening for you 
And whatever you do, when everything still seems new 
It's sure to come to something to change the rest of your life 
A chance to feel normal, but now you're in too deep 
Pacing circles around your eyes, the rest of the world's fast asleep 
No sense of direction, no sense at all 
No one there to break your fall, no one knows what's happening to you 
I never quite got that through; I know what waits for you 
I know for something to do with the rest of your life 
Stop looking over my shoulder, it was a little bolder 
You're going somewhere I might be on your way 
This time I don't mean maybe 
Nowhere I'd rather be 
If you're coming with me I might be on your way 
I saw you there on the corner with my name written all over you 
I was trying to get your attention, it's all I ever wanted from you 
Who will be the victim, who will be the host 
Who will you take it out on for not being there when you needed them most 
For you, I'm coming to terms with you 
And you can pull me through, 
I'm settling up with something to change the rest of my life 
Something to do with the rest of my life 
I need something to fear the rest of my life's not in vain
