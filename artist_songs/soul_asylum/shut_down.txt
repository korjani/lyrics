I've been vindicated 
I've been loved and hated 
I've been pulled aside and told that life was overrated 
No, I don't believe it 
I just can't conceive it 
I can write all night but in the morning I can't read it 

Oh no, don't know what's the matter 
Stuck up on a ladder, scared of coming down 
If I don't get what I want 
And there ain't enough to go around 
I become oblivious to the obvious 
Just ridiculous 

As I flip the pages 
You're a time that ageless 
In between us lies a calm before the storm that rages 
Though we were related 
Couldn't be separated 
Tried to get ahead but only got decapitated 

If I don't get what you want 
And you don't get what I need 
We become oblivious to the obvious 
Just dysfunctional 
Shut down 

When I can't get keep from getting down 
And I grow tired of hangin' 'round 
I become invisible, unlivable 
Just dysfunctional 
Shut down
