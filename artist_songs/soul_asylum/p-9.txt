Somebody's thinking that there might be something wrong 
Business is sinking and the crew's been casted off 
Nobody's bailing, nobody's sailing, but we're watching it from shore 
Nobody's working and we better work this out 
If we could see eye to eye, you could see just exactly who is small 
But I do my job and do it well and go to hell for writing on the wall 
There'd be enough to go around if I could just get around you 
I am not down, my hands are empty, and they're open and I need something to do 
And it makes me wonder who I'm working for 
'Cause I think you know just what I'm looking for 
And it makes me wonder who you're working for 
How many children are waiting by your door? 
Is this just a job that I'm working for? 
You gave me nothing now you're taking it away 
I should be walkin' and makin' it easy to ignore but I guess I'd better stay 
And I forgave you for all the people you've done wrong 
Nobody's working and it's gone on far too long 
And it makes me wonder who you're working for 
'Cause I think you know just what I'm looking for 
And it makes me wonder who I'm working for 
How many children are waiting by your door? 
Is it just a paycheck I'm fighting for?
