Dear mother, what can I say
It's been so long since I went away
And yes, I miss the comforts of home
But I guess I'm better off on my own

No one told me people could be so cruel
Nobody told me about any of this in school
Still nobody understands the things that I don't understand

I've nothing to write home about
Nothing I have figured out
Still I have the same old doubts
Nothing to write home about

Dear John, that ain't my name
I'm just hangin' 'round to take the blame
I'm filled with guilt, I'm filled with shame
Too much or not enough it's all the same

And no one wants to talk about the loss
No one wants to talk about the cost

Every one just looks away, just like any other day

I've nothing to write home about
Nothing I have figured out
Still I have the same old doubts
Nothing to write home about

Who can teach me how to change my ways
Who will come and save the day
Who will tell me what to say
When there's nothing left to say

Nobody told me about any of this in school
No one told me I'd be taken for a fool
And everyone just looks away, and tries to make it through the day

I've nothing to write home about
Nothing I have figured out
Still I have the same old doubts
Nothing to write home about
