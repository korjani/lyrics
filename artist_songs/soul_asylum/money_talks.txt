Money talks these days and everybody listens
We're whipping out our wallets trying to but what we're missing

Money screams out "I need a slave"
I'm just trying to find some worker to dig my grave

Everybody's listening, everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening
I need more, a little more, in a little while

I say those???
Machines?

I'm just trying to find somebody to pay my bail
Money screams is says "My soul's for sale"

Everybody's listening, everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening

I need a maid to pick up my mess, help me in the morning, help me get dressed
I'll pay you when I get paid, I'll pay you when I get paid

Money talks these days, money talks these days
What you gonna do when the criminal says "Your money or your life"?
(Not used?)
I need more, I'm bored, shine my shoes, wax my floor

Mew father of our powerful land of the free
I ain't doing nothing, I'll just jire someone to do it for me

No matter how small George gets he'll still talk louder than you
Dollars shrieking "Ha, ha, ha jokes's on you"

End everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening

Rich bored, blind, and lone, better buy me a wife
I'm saving up everything to buy me a knife
