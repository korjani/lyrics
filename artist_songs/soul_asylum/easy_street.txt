Did you hear the one about the friend of a a friend who tried to end it all 
At the last moment he picked up the phone and gave you a call 
You thought about letting it ring, but you answered after all 
And there you were, put on the spot at the end of the other line 
For questions that you never thought you'd ever have to answer to 
Who do you turn to when the ones you always turn to go and turn on you 
It leaves you in the dark, feeling for a switch to turn it on again 
There are no easy answers, the questions remain tough 
There's no shortcuts to easy street, no corners you can cut 
Can you cut this diamond in the rough 
And it's good to see you alive 
Sign your will to survive 
A look into your heart before it sees its final hour 
Lived each day like there is no tomorrow 
Beyond this mess ahead there is a street so very hard to find 
Though I have got to lay my head down at this dead end so many times 
And if we ever get to easy street, you can say with a smile 
I came just for the ride
