Streets are filled broken glass
You get buried by the past
Give me just a little taste
Lay this mask to waste
Take me home

My mind is racing take me home
My body's aching so alone
I'll make you wanna stay with me
Befriended by the enemy
One more time

Every little thing about this tells me
Nothing out there is ever gonna help me
All these words that I hear spoken
Just promises broken

Lookin' outside from a window sill
Throw another coin in my wishin' well
Never find what you're lookin' for
15 miles
Your dim light shines from so far away
Your sad smile is all I see
When I say...

Every little thing about this tells me 
Nothing out there is ever gonna help me
And all these words that I hear spoken
Just promises broken

From the hotel satellite
Don't look like you're living right
Here's a deal you can't refuse
You ain't got as much to lose

Can you tell your troubles to
Someone who won't laugh at you
It's alright
And as I watch you walk away
Hope a part of you will stay
It's alright
