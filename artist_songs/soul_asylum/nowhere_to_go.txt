Oh the west
Where the men were mean
The women were scarce
And the sheep were mighty nervous
You know I'm just a cowboy
But I got no place to go
There's no more ranges for me to ride
They got rid of those 60, 70 years ago

Stop,
Look where you're going
You're not going anywhere
People everywhere
New hairstyles

I ain't got nowhere
Nowhere to go
Sometimes I feel so 

So all alone
I ain't got nowhere 
Nobody's home
I need a fix and I'm oh so alone

You 
Easier said than done
I want you to make up your mind
Don't bother telling me when you're done
Are you all done?
I ain't got nowhere
Nowhere to hide
Sometimes I wish I could see the other side
I ain't got nowhere
Nowhere to go
I'm coming down and I'm oh so alone
