You make me fall from
Lies of hate
You make these walls from
Lines of a face

Nobody's watching so why do you act like a fake
You make me crawl from
Lies of hate
You wake me up from
The lines that separate

And when you shine
I know how to find out about
How to get out of it
How to get out of these chains
How to get out of it
How to get out of it
How to get out of this place

You make me fall from
Lies of hate

And when you shine
I know how to find out about
How to get out of it
How to get out of this chase
How to find out about
How to get out of it
How to get out of your space
How to get out of it
How to get out of it
How to get out of this place
How to find out about
How to go out without
Living the lies of hate
