She's all by herself at the end of the day
She'd talk to herself but wouldn't know what to say
Wrings her hands and steps out of the bath
The mirror laughs and splits her in half

She looks around the room
At her carpeted tomb
Threw the phone on the floor
Left the keys in the door

Tell me when does life begin

She got in the car and looked up at the stars
And made a wish
She held her breath and considered death

And in the rearview mirror
She looked back on her reflection
She was a long way from she wanted to be
And a long way from perfection

Tell me when does life begin

She chickened out and she called triple-A
And told them the way
After she paid they fixed the car
She got on her way and she drove past the bar

Where no one bought her a drink at
She always though it was 'cause she was too fat
And now she knows those places blow
Or maybe it was her nose

Tell me when does life begin
