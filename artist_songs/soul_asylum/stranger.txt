I said "Hey brown girl I seen tears through the window of the junk shop downtown"
Selling trinkets from your far off homeland, did the Promise land let you down?

I said "hey young boy I notice that you ain't afraid to walk next to me"
"Old man, you look like you're dying, is that all you want is a quarter from me?"

Sometimes I feel like a stranger, I feel like a stranger

I'm just another face in a faceless crowd, I'm just another king in a headless crown
I'm so alone. Y'know I live here in this city, but this place it just ain't nobody's home

Now how many times do I got to tell you?
There's no such thing as a man made world
Now how many times do I got to tell you?
There's no such thing as a man-tamed girl

Sometimes I feel like stranger, I feel like a stranger

I want to buy some flowers for my mother, if I only had a chance
You see, I got a happy family, but that's oh so far away
You see, I've got it all here inside me, but I just can't seem to get it out
But I know with a little imagination we can work this whole goddamn thing out

Oh don't make me feel so strange, I feel like a stranger
