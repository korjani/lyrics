There's just no substitute for fun 
I've tried every single one 
And no one can take your place 
Everybody gets replaced 
My time has neither come nor gone 
It just slips out when I yawn 
Without hope I can't go wrong 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now 
It's so hard to settle down 
Don't recognize my home town 
Home is where I hang my head 
Lost in all these things I said 
Been holding my breath for so long 
I don't need air anymore 
If you never let me breathe 
I'll never breathe, I'll never breath 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now 
Don't know what I was hoping for 
I feel like feeling better than I ever felt before 
My time has neither come nor gone 
It just slips out when I yawn 
Holding my breath for so long, for so long 
Don't want to be bored no more 
I know there's so much more 
Don't know what I was hoping for 
I feel like feeling better than I ever felt before 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now 
Don't get my hopes up, don't get my hopes up 
Don't get my hopes up now
