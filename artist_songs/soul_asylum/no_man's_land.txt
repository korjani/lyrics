In a town without a name
there is no shame
no blame to claim
one fine day the pilgrims came
and made new rules for an old game
And I'm waiting for the garbage man To take you away
And I'm searching for my playground
So I can go and play
So they built a big smoke stack
Built a railroad track
They made the dirt roads black
And they did it behind your back
And now you pay their tax
hoping something cracks
And I'm waiting for the garbage man
To take you away
And I'm searching for my playground
So I can go and play
From out of the dust came corrosion and rust
That made you look so cheap
There's nothing to have here
And nothing to hold here
And nothing that you can keep
Now understand this is no man's land
And its all that's left that's free
Where the kings of nothing rule my friend

And you can't make me leave
There's a billboard in the sky
Reflecting water in your eyes
This big city, this ghost town
Will come crawling to the ground
And I'm waiting for the hurricane To blow you away
And I'm searching for my twister
to twist you into shape
Now my speach is said and done
The circus came, I had my fun
And the wasteland has been won
And the building has begun
And I'm waiting for the earthquake To shake you down
And I see my mother nature Trying to drag you around
From out of the dust came
Corrosion and rust
That made you look so cheap
There's nothing to have here
And nothing to hold here
And nothing that you can keep
Now understand this is no man's land
And its all that's left that's free
Where the kings of nothing rule my friend
(Then you can't make believe?)
