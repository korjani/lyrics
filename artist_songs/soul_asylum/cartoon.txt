Now everybody's looking after me, 
If I'm dragging by some coat tail, I can't see; it's too dark, 
But I've got to know what's got the best of me. 
When the circus that you left goes on parade, 
And those things you see seem so far in your charade's too far, 
But I'm feeling like I don't dare look away, Don't look away. 
Did it almost make you feel, that something's got to happen soon, 
When you wake up feeling lost in your own room. 
If you're crying in your beer, you're gonna drown, 
If you think we'll rise above, you'd better look around, you'll see. 
It's a mountain made of sand crumbling under me. 
Maybe I'm chasing shadows on your wall, 
They loom so large, but make me feel so small somehow, 
When you're chasing your own tail spinning your own wheels. 
And a time to leave, and a time to stay, I guess the things I look away. 
Did it almost make you feel that somethings gotta happen soon. 
You're in the movies now that I'm in your cartoon. 
There's a ringing in my ears that's heaven sent. 
There's a beast out on the ruins, some broken down lover's lament. 
It goes on and on but it won't go away.
