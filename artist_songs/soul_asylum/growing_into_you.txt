You never grow out of mischief making
You never grow out of taking
You never grow out of complicating
When simple things are waiting

But I'm growing into you, I'm growing into you
There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear
You never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear

You never grow out of contemplating
When it ain't worth debating
You never grow out of mistake making
You never grow out of faking

But I'm growing into you, I'm growing into you
There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear
You never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear

I'm growing into you, I'm growing into you
There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear
You never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear
You never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear, you never grow out of fear
And will I ever, ever, ever get over it, get over it...
