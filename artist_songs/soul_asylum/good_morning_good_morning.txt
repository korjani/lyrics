Good morning good morning
Good morning good morning
Good morning

Nothing to do to save his life
Call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day
How's your boy been?

Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got noting to say but it's okay

Good morning good morning
Good morning

Going to work don't want to go
Feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam
Then you're in town

Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

After a while you start to smile
Now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk
By the old school

Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Good morning good morning
Good morning

People running 'round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time
Glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt
Now you're in gear

Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Good morning good morning
Good morning good morning

Good morning good morning
Good morning
