You sold your soul for a lump of coal 
She's blacker than the night 
Didn't think you'd be needing it 
But you thought 
But you never know who you might meet 
On the street where the church bells ring to a different beat 
Is it joy, is it pain? Is it rustin' in the rain? 
Do you really think I need it? 
Is it just plain evil? 
Heard of a man who had a plan 
To save the wretched world 
Nationwide genocide, like one-eyed jacks 
And suicide queens 
Look out for if you know what I mean 
Is it good, is it bad? Is it bitter, is it sad? 
Is it inside all these people? 
Is it just plain evil? You've got a lot to learn 
You've got a lot to change, you've got nothing to lose 
But a ball and chain 
Is it good, is it bad?Is it bitter, is it sad? 
Do you really think I need it? Is it just plain evil?
