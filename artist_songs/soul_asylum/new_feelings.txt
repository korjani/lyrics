Sroll away the chains that wrap around me 
Wipe the spider webs from my eyes 
Tumble down the tall walls that surround me 
I won't need no lies no alibis 
My new feeling 
New feeling [x5]
Daydreams screams 
They just don't seem so far away 
No I'm not possessed by my possessions 
Lift my head to clear my right to die 
You're in love with your evangelist investment 
I don't need an alibi 
My new feeling 
New feeling [x5]
Daydreams screams 
They just don't seem so far away 
My head's like a wrecking ball and you look like a wall 
Mopping up the tears that fill your eyes 
This is my life, my right and that's not all 
I just laughed my head off and cried 
My new feeling ...
