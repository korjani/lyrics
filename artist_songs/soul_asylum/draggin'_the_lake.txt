Sent on a mission to find out
Just how much shit one man can take
Went to the river to swim upstream
But got dragged into the lake

You're wide awake
But still you're dreaming
Of the pride it takes
It has no meaning

Am I still here
Can you see me, please say yes
Can you heal me, please say yes
When you watch over me, I am blessed

Now that you're all grown up
You're not so self assured, you'll never know
Who do you answer to when
No one's hanging round to let it show

You're wide awake
But still you're dreaming

The pride it takes
It has no meaning

Am I still here
Can you hear me, please say yes
Can you heal me, please say yes
When you watch over me, I am blessed

You're old enough to know better
Than to expect anything
Take care of yourself
You should know not to depend on anyone

Am I still here
Can you feel me, please say yes
Can you heal me, please say yes
When you watch over me, I am blessed

Am I still here
Can you see me, please say yes
Can you heal me, please say yes
When you watch over me, I am blessed
