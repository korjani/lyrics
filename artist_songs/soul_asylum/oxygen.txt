Wishin' upon a mattress
Fallin' off the excess
Slippin' the stillness
Flippin' the bird

I walk you home when you're wasted
I can almost taste it
All this oxygen is for you

But it's a couple more volts of shock treatment for you
When a couple more votes of confidence will do

I walk you home when you're wasted
I can almost taste it

It's a couple more volts of shock treatment for you
When a couple more votes of confidence will do

Always there to remind you
Before and behind you
It follows you everywhere you go

They may say you're crazy
It don't even phase me
'Cause you're the sanest one I know

Just a couple more breaths of oxygen will do
They may say you're crazy
It makes you so amazing

But it's a couple more volts of shock treatment for you
Couple more volts of shock treatment for you
When a couple more votes of confidence will do
A little bit less of loneliness will do
Just a couple more breaths of oxygen will do
But it's a couple more bills and a couple more pills
And a couple more why do you do those things you do?!
Shock! Shock treatment for you!
Just a couple more volts of shock treatment for you
Shock! Shock treatment for you!
Just a couple more breaths of oxygen will do
Shock! Shock treatment for you!
Treatment, treatment for you!
Shock! Shock treatment for you!
That'll do, that'll do, that'll do, that'll do, that'll do
