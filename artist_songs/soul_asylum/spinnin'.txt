Follows me wherever we go 
Undermining all that we know 
Suddenly starts thinkin' been fooled from the beginnin' 
When the cause is lost you find there is no point in winnin' 
Then it's hard to think straight when your head it keeps on spinnin' 
If I lost my mind, would you help me find it? 
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me 
Things aren't quite the way they should be 
And now it seems my peace of mind has come up for the biddin' 
All those I respect and trust I guess they were just kiddin' 
And they will say it's me who's lost, and as you sit there grinnin' 
My little world has lost control but still it keeps on spinnin' 
If I lost my mind, would you help me find it? 
If I lost my mind, I wouldn't have to be reminded 
If I lost my mind I'm not sure I would mind 
Would you help me find it?
