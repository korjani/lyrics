It's enough to make you stay 
It's enough to make you go away 
But you don't understand how I'm feeling 
You don't understand no no 
It's enough to make you sick 
It's enough to make you wanna quit 
But you don't understand how I'm feeling 
You don't understand my life 
It's sad when you can't cry 
It all comes down to time keeps flying by 
Time keeps telling me 
There's no time for waiting 
For the river to wash into the sea 
And when I reach some understanding 
I'm gonna let it wash all over, wash all over me 
It's too much to make you say 
That you always wanted to be this way 
But you don't understand this feeling 
So why do I even try 
It's sad when you can't try 
It all comes down to time keeps killing time time keeps healing 
I've no time for waiting 
For the river to wash into the sea 
And when I reach some understanding 
I'm gonna let it wash all over, wash all over me 
But I know one day you'll see 
The person I wanted to be 
And there's no time for waiting 
There's no time for waiting 
Can't find the time, can't find the time 
There's no time, there's no time 
There's no time, can't find the time
