Wanna see you in my rearview mirror
Out on the freeway freeway
Nobody said it would be easy
Freeway freeway
Take me back to 
I can't change the time and
I can't change your mind
But I gotta find a freeway
You're on my way
On my way

Leeway I need a little leeway
Got to get some space around and ??
Leeway leeway 
Make the best of nothing left for me
I can't find the time
Gotta see what I can find

Out on the freeway
You're on my way
On my way

I'm not talking

Someday someday
I ain't waiting around for someday
Someday someday
I'm gonna get away from all this someday
I can't change the time and
I can't change your mind
You're on my way
On my way
