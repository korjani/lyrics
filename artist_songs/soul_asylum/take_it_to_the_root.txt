Hey what're you doing comin' around my place
I've been cryin', tears are down my face
Do this, do that, it's always push, push, push
But I sure grow tired of beating 'round the bush

Take it to the root

Hey what're you saying, calling out my name
I ain't got no shame, better find someone else to blame
Talking 'round in circles, take it to the point
?? someone else to give support

Take it to the root

I can't take it, always in my face
Hey, don't I know you? I've seen you someplace
Back before you know it, back for more abuse
Back to where I started from, home and on the loose

Take it to the root

Take it to the root one time
Take it to the root two times
Take it to the root three times
Take it to the root four times
