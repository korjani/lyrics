It's a second hand story no one wants to hear 
And it's wet with blood, salted with tears 
It's black and white and red all over, happens all the time 
This was something about an artificial heart 
She lived in a sleepy town trailer home park 
Where not many people go out after dark 
Innocent helpless at 17, queen of every loser's wet dream 
Which brings us to our villain but a mother could love 
He liked amputation and the Lord above 
He kidnapped her on her way home from school 
She lost her mind, he lost his cool 
She didn't tell him about the artificial heart 
Then some kid found her head 
Then an arm and a leg and you know the rest they said 
The artificial heart it was still beating 
With a needle and a thread they sewed on her head 
She's alive and well like she was never dead 
She doesn't remember the day she didn't die 
Or how everybody cried 
She read a story in the paper how she was victimized 
And you should have seen the look in her eyes 
Her assailant was acquitted and as she read 
I swear she laughed off her head
