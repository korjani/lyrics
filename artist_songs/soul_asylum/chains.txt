The mirror on the wall it tells no lies 
And oh I don't like what I see 
I see a woman there I watch her as she cries 
And the woman isn't really me 
But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around 
Look for you, hold me, tender, set me free 
I need to feel you put your hands around me 
Day in, day out it's the same old story 
You're out there on your own 
Is he worth the price you pay 
Got you in his chains 
Will he set you free someday 
I wish I didn't feel this way I can't get nothing done 
And all I want to do is go to sleep 
Though I lie in bed for hours I cannot close my eyes 
And lonely days turn into lonely weeks 
But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around 
Look for you, tender, hold me, set me free 
I need to feel you put your hands around me 
Day in, day out, it's the same old story 
You're out there on your own 
Is he worth the price you pay 
Got you in his chains 
Will he set you free someday 
Every now and then I think things might be all right 
And I think I see a light beyond the door 
Just as I approach it disappears again 
And everything seems darker than before 
But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around 
Look for you, hold me, tender, set me free 
I need to feel you put your hands around me 
Day in, day out, it's the same old story 
You're out there on your own 
Is he worth the price you pay 
Got you in his chains 
Will he set you free someday
