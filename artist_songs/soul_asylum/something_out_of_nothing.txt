Well if there's one thing that I know, it's easy to kill what's hard to grow
One thing I might say, no one's gotta know about running away

Trying to make something out of nothing
Leaning hard on yet another drug
All of these temptations keep me wanting to feel your touch
It's not supposed to make you feel so

Helpless, selfless, crying for some tenderness
I miss your kiss, impossible to resist

Find some budget to support my habit
Suffering an under-dose of love
All of these temptations keep wanting the sky above

Oh my desperate disposition keeps me bitching, keeps me wishing

Wishing for some shelter from within
There ain't nothing I can't live with nothing I can't live without

I want this, I want that; I wanted just a little slack
It's like an itch that I can't scratch, could you get this monkey off my back

Trying to make something out of nothing
I can't live without
Wanting nothing

Oh my desperate disposition keeps me bitching keeps me wishing
Wishing for some shelter from within
It's not supposed to make you feel this way
