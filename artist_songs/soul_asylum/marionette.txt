Marionette I haven't met you yet 
I hear you're good I hear you're made out of wood 
Not quite as blind as you might think she'd be 
And they cut off your wings and replaced them with strings 
Now the strings attach to everything 
It's twisted and tangled and troubled with anger 
But somehow you still swing 
Tried all my tricks I tried to steal a kiss 
Splinters and slivers stuck all over my lips 
She thinks she must be doing something wrong 
They pull the strings and then they string you along 
And they cut off your wings and replaced them with strings 
Now the strings attach to everything 
It's twisted and tangled but I've got an angle 
On just what makes you swing 
Hanging by a string 
Know the boss he makes her do things his way 
So why do you think she's so scared of you 
What do you think makes her that way 
When push comes to shove she'll push and shove 
It doesn't always have to be this way 
She's saving up for a vacation somewhere 
Why do you think she's so scared of you 
What do you think makes her that way 
When push comes to shove she'll push and shove 
It's very hard work when you don't get paid 
And they cut off your wings and replaced them with strings
