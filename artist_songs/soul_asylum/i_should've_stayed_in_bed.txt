I'm gonna stay in bed all day
I'm gonna stay in bed all day
And this could be my lucky day
Or it could turn to black
I might get lucky anyway
I might never come back

And it's too late for a wake up call
Too late for a wake up call

I'm gonna put it off today
I'm gonna put you off
Nothing I got to do today except for blow you off
My dreams are all just throwaways
My superstitions lack
I'm just unlucky anyway
All of my cats are black

Don't let the sun pass you by
Don't let it fall from the sky
Don't let the sunshine pass you by
Don't let the tear fall from your eye
I could have stayed in bed all day
I could have stayed in bed all day
Nothing I got to do today
I might just rise and shine

Don't let the sun pass you by
Don't let it fall from the sky
Don't let the sunshine pass you by
Don't let the tear fall from your eye
Its there each time I turn around I look away and you'll be gone
I could have done so many things
I could have stayed
I could have stayed

I should have stayed in bed all day
I should have stayed in bed all day
