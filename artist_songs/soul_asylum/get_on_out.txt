I gotta get on
I gotta get on out
All these worried troubled thoughts gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head

Will I be on the streets tomorrow
Will I have to beg and borrow
Will I have to go back to the job I left behind
Could you still make it
With a guy who never made it
Would you look into my eyes if I were to go blind

Gotta get on
I gotta get on out
All these worried troubled thoughts gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head

Now will you leave me for another
Send me running back to mother
Will I have the time to tell you how I really feel
Am I just getting slower
Or are you just talking faster
Do we need bad disaster to make it plain to see

That all these worried troubled thoughts gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head

Do I just feel like cryin'
Cause I'm sick and tried of tryin'
Trying to convince you this ain't how it has to be
The ground you walk on's sacred
The sky above awaits you
So cast all your frustrations to the bottomless sea

Gotta get on
Gotta get on out
All these worried troubled thoughts gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head
