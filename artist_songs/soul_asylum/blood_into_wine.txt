Nothing happened, it's just two people passing through 
Hearing voices in my head, hope they never lie to you 
Why's something always gotta be up with you 
Whatever I do is never enough for someone like you 
Passing through you all the time 
Turning blood into wine, turning blood into wine 
Who'll forgive me, who's to say if it's right or wrong 
And you won't see me in a light that shines on me 
And how come something's always gotta be up with you 
Back on my feet but the night's getting long, do you think about me too 
Turning blood into wine 
It's passing through you all the time 
Turning blood into wine 
Three more days and you'll be hanging on the line 
And if they ask you how I'm doing 
Just tell 'em that I'm fine, staying out all the time 
Is turning blood into wine, turning blood into wine 
Blood into wine
