You got me going, so get me out of here 
I should be blowin', in someone else's ear 
I'm looking forward to looking back 
On days like today 
Though I wish you would go away 
Stay, won't you stay 
I'm gonna crawl, cra-ha-hawl, cra-ha-hawl 
I never felt better just crawling home 
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone 
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer 
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home from here 
Some respond to pleasure, some respond to pain 
I'm hangin' out to dry, in the pouring rain 
Victims of temptation, never can complain 
I could use the sensation, you see I can't feel pain 
I'm gonna crawl, cra-ha-hawl, cra-ha-hawl 
I never ever said I'd never make it home 
It's just a stone's throw, a crawl home 
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer 
I'm just a crawl home, crawl home from here 
I could use someone, to drag me out of here 
I am that someone, it's all become quite clear 
So get me out of here 
I never felt better just crawling home 
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone 
Good to see you, see you later, and I'm outta here 
I'm just a crawl home, crawl home from here
