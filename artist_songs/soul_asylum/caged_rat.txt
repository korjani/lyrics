Why don't you go home and crawl into your hole 
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone 
In the corner I looked across the room 
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon 
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat 
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat 
In the corner I looked across the room 
In the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon 
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat 
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat 
Why don't you go home and crawl into your hole 
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone 
From the corner I looked across the room 
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon 
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat 
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
