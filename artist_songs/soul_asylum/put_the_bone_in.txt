Put the bone in
She yelled at the store
'Cause my doggie's been hit by a car
And I do want to bring him home something
Put the bone in
She yelled out once more
Because the meat from the pork is so sweet
And the bone from the pork give to me
Put the bone in she begged him

As she paced across the floor
Put the bone in she yelled out once more

Put the bone in
She yelled at the store
Cause my doggie's been hit by a car
And I do want to bring him home something
Put the bone in
She yelled out once more ...
