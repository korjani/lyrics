Twiddly dee fe fi fo fum 
There's a giant sleeping and his pants are undone 
He shows no pity for anyone 
He's sure to be killed before the morning comes 
Twiddle my fingers and I twiddle my thumb 
'Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til my work is all done 
I'm a high society skid row bum 
Well on my way to Kingdom Come 
I twiddle in the middle of the moon and sun 
I'm wishing and dreaming I'm a special someone 
Don't leave my load on anyone 
It's way too high and it weighs a ton 
Do re mi fe fi fo fum 
I'm a slave to the music of a father and son 
I never force it on anyone 
Can't keep it a secret so I keep it on the run 
They may say what they say about the way that we stay 
They may do what they do about the things that we do 
Ain't worried about the dumb things I done 
Ain't worried about the dumb things to come 
Sometimes I wanna be friends with everyone 
My friends tell me it can't be done 
And some days I feel I don't know anyone 
Now what goes up doesn't always come down 
You'll never believe the things I've found 
Amazing what you learn just hanging around 
Can't put a square peg in a hole that's round 
They may say what they say about the way that we stay 
They may do what they do about the things that we do 
If we win or if we lose it's a pleasure to play 
Work all night and I sleep all day 
Just because I'm lucky I can live my own way
