Well, a fascinating sensation, no I can't even feel it
I just had to let you know I can't conceal it
I was recently considering taking the pain with the pleasure
Just to find my way to the bottom of this, I'll have to dig forever

And it's no small measure
Lift up your veil of tears

Don't be disappointed child, if your prayers go unanswered
We are not responsible for these sad circumstances
Secret agents and freedom fighters on those impossible missions
Better put your toys and games away, maybe take the kids out fishing

For a family treasure
In your early years
Behind your veil of tears

So frustrated
Get up anyway
So complicated

Changes every day

So the darkness fades
And the light will come shining through

I heard the eyes that look to a better world
always hide beneath the veil of tears
And you hide no more
Lift up your veil of tears
Hide no more
Behind your veil of tears

Now the executioner must be executed
No I think we'll set him free instead, watch him run

And you hide no more
Lift up your veil of tears
You hide no more
