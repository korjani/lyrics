I know I told you no before
I wouldn't let you past my door
'Cause there was someone else inside

But I guess he found somebody new
And nothing I can say or do
Will put her out of his mind

And he, he was just leaving
You're just in time this time
And I sure could use a friend

I, I've got this feeling
He was just leaving
So come on in

Funny, you should come around tonight
Just when things aren't going right
Just when the door is open wide

And he, he was just leaving
You're just in time this time
And I sure could use a friend

I, I've got this feeling
He was just leaving
So come on in
