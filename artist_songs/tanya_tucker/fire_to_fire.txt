There's no such thing as perfect strangers
So I come to you the way I am
If you call on me to sacrifice
I won't promise that I can

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

We will wake up when the moment's gone
And I'll still feel you on my fingertips
But they'll be nothing in the afterburn
But the taste upon our lips

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

I'm not here tonight to rescue you
And you don't need me in your life
But I know I'll have the best of you tonight

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire
