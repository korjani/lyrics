Every night I hope and pray A dream lover will come my way
Hold me in loving arms and feel the magic of her charms
Cause I want, I want, a girl, a boy, just to call, just to call, my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you with a love that's so, so true
And a hand that I can hold Hand in hand as we grow old
Cause I want, I want, a girl, a boy, Just to call, just to call, my own 
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Someday I don't know how I hope she'll hear my plea
Someday I don't know how he'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then I'll go asleep and dream again
That's the only thing I can do to make my loving dreams come true.
Cause I want, I want, a girl, a boy, just to call, just to call, my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone dream lover
Don't want to dream alone I don't want to dream alone dream lover
Be my be my be my dream lover I don't want to dream alone
Dream lover just dream dream lover all my lovin' sweet dream 
Dream lover
