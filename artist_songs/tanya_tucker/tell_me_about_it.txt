They say that there's a hole
In the atmosphere
The things you think
Will last disappear

When you were ready to say I do
Somebody lowered the boom on you
And now you need a sympathetic ear

So baby, tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart

You say you need someone to hold you tight
You can't stand another lonely night
Well, come closer and
Tell me about it

Love isn't always true
It hurts sometimes
Your tears will tell on you girl
I'm not blind

I know what you're goin' through
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder, cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heart

You say you need someone to hold you tight
You can't stand another lonely night
Well, come closer and
Tell me about it

You took a lesson in playin' a fool
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder, cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heart

You say you need someone to hold you tight
You can't stand another lonely night
Well, come closer and
Tell me about it

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heart

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
