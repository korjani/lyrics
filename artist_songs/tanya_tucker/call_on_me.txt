If your world comes crashing down;
If you need comfort but it can't be found;
If you're lonely, you can always call on me.

If nobody is listening to you,
I'll be the walls you tell your secrets to.
If you want me, night or day, just call on me.

I'm not asking for rings of gold,
Just one ring on my telephone.
I'm just wanting a chance to prove,
That my love is true;
If it connects with you,
Call on me.

There's no-one that I call mine,
I'm only held by the hands of time,
And it's a long wait, hoping you will call on me.

There's nothin' silent as a 'phone that won't ring.
Nothin' louder than your voice in my dreams,
It's a heartache knowing you don't call on me.

I'm not asking for rings of gold,
Just one ring on my telephone.
I'm just wanting a chance to prove,
That my love is true;
If it connects with you,
Call on me. (Call on me.)

Yeah, (Call on me.) 

If you ever wanna get me on the line,
You got my number, it's this heart of mine.
I'm not asking for a ring of gold,
Just a love that won't turn cold.
Call on me.
Call me, yeah.
Call on Me.
Call me.
