Then we gonna ride, 
gonna smoke some weed. 
Climb upon my big-ass steed, 
And ride, ride, ride.

What's the name of the song, 
Explosivo! 
Don't know what it's about, 
But it's good to go. 
What's the name of my girlfriend 
I don't know,

She's good to go, 
She's good to go. 

We are fuelled by Satan, 
Yes we're schooled by Satan. 
Fuelled by Satan! 
Writin' those tasty riffs

Schooled by Satan! 

We were the inventors 
of the cosmic astral code. 
We've come to blow you away, 
We've come to blow your nose. 
We've come to fuckin' blow, 
We've come to blow the show. 
We've come to fuckin' blow, 
You know it, you know it! 

Weeee-eee-eee-eeeee-eeeee-eee-eee-eeeee-eeeee-eeeee-eeeee, 
What's the name of the song, 
Explosivo! 
Don't know what it's about 
But it's good to riddle-ah!
