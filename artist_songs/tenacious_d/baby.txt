I can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how hard I try
Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the wind is a whistlin'
And I can't seem to put out the light

Momma's been searching for baby
But baby been tryin' to get home
Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the moon cannot light the way
And Daddy's gone, bye bye

I'm just a babyyyyy

I've had this birthmark since I was born,
It's the name of our fucking band dude.

I have an ass mark too
