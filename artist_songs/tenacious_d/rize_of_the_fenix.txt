When "The Pick of Destiny" was released, it was a bomb
And all the critics said that The D was done
The sun had set and the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about was The D will rise again

Just like the phoenix,
We'll fucking rise again!
That's right the phoenix,
We'll rise again!

Cause' the fiery heart of a champion cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment, no way, no
And the critics all agreed it was a stinky pile of chee
But that does not mean that our hearts are not strong

Just like the phoenix,
We'll fucking rise again!
That's right the phoenix,
We'll rise again!

Sun shining, it's a Hell of a day
Riding back and it's headed your way
D's here, now we're putting on a show
We're sneaking up, climbing into your window

Out rocking, yea we're rocking again
Black Mamba is my personal friend
Phil Jackson is the master of zen
We'll pick you up, take you out on the weekend

It's the rise of the phoenix,
It's the call of attack
And you'll know when you've seen us
The fucking D is back, ya'll!

Lovemaking all the way to the top
Boots smoking, but I'm not gonna stop
Bossa Nova is a beautiful dance
Hot-blooded, that's a lots of romance

It's the rise of the phoenix,
And we ride with the pack
It's the magic between us
The fucking D is back

But what if it's true?
If Tenacious D has died, what will we do?
And what will we do,
About all the fans who have The D tattoo?
They'll have them removed,
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Tattoos..
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos

[JB:] Wait a minute Kage.
[KG:] What's that you say?
[JB:] You know it's not too late.
[KG:] Yes, it is too late.
[JB:] We only need one hit.
[KG:] Just imagine it.
[JB:] We could be the shit!
[Both:] Too legit to quit!

One hit!
One hit!
One hit!
Yea, I'm hoping this is it
One hit!
Top 10 hit!
Top 40 hit!
Top 1,000 hit!

I don't care,
As long as we get there!
We'll start anew,
And you can get a new Tenacious D tattoo!

You can get a new Tenacious D tattoo!
