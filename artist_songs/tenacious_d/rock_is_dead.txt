Go

Rock is dead, rock is dead
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Talk to my friend, that's what he said
Is rock still around? No rock is dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead

Bottle of jack, Mercury Fred
Muscle car, Grateful Dead
Lord of the Rings, Zeppelin Led
Devil tattoo, Right Said Fred
It's all over, rock and roll is dead

Take it Kones!

Started with blues, Belly of lead
Then there was Elvis, Nicky some red
Beatles arrive, started a trend
Axl Rose, give me some head
It's all over, rock and roll is dead

Rock is dead, rock is dead
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Get that freight train out of my head
Because a rock and a roll is a fuckin' dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
It's all over, rock and roll
Oh so baby now, rock and roll
R-r-r-r-r-rock and roll
Is dead

Woo
