I'm used to smelling you cooking grits in the morning
After rolling out of bed, making love to you
I miss your sweet voice saying "baby hold me"
Our lazy loving, this fragrance of pride
Girl when you left, you left everything
Your [?], your energy, your shoes still by the bed

My nights are lonely and the days ain't good
Baby I'm lost without you

[Hook:]
I know I was a fool, (fool) yeah
I know I was wrong
Baby I changed and I'm missing you
Make this house a home
Baby come back

Today I went by your mamas house (your mamas house)
And knocked on the door (knocked on her door)
And told her I'm in need of forgiveness
(I got to repent for love)
And then she talked to her daughter
Cause she should know, I ain't the first
I ain't the first man to make the first mistake
And not the first man to say

My nights are lonely and the days ain't good
Baby I'm lost without you

[Hook:]
I know I was a fool, (fool) yeah
I know I was wrong
Baby I changed and I'm missing you
Make this house a home
Baby come back

Baby us as men, sometimes we can be the king of neglect
Where we wanna go, what we wanna do , what we wanna eat
But then, then we realize that we're thirsty when there's, when there's no water left

[Hook:]
I know I was a fool, (fool) yeah
I know I was wrong
Baby I changed and I'm missing you
Make this house a home
Baby come back
