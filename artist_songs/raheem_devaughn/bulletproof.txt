Load It, Cock It, Aim and Shoot 
Load It, Cock It, Aim and Shoot 

Living like we bulletproof 
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
I say we load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
Oh we load it, cock it, aim and shoot 

Some will die over oil kill over land 
Charge you for taxes and Blame Uncle Sam 
Read you your rights and charge you for nothing 
Now who’s really gangsta 
And tell me who’s frontin’ 
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters 
Here overseas and across the waters 
Tanks and missiles, bombs and grenades 
Inject the land with guns and aids 

You better pray to the most high or who ever you praise 
Politicians can’t help you they puppets to slaves 
Trying to get paid and you are too 
Whatcha gone do when the gun is pointed at you 
Like bank robbers 

Living like we bulletproof 
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot) 
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(We gone die) 
Living like we bulletproof 
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot) 
Oh we load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
Hey world 

Get you a paper turn on the news 
Ride through the hood I witness the blues 
How can you ignore it it’s easy to spot it 
A trap house, a liquor store and your city’s got it 

And my city’s got it, and they city’s got it 
This world is chaotic and love is symbolic 
So life don’t get cherished, and our babies perish 
And your babies perish now tell me who’s careless 
Now who should I pray to what should I pray for 
You can’t pay the preacher for your redemption 
I know where we’re headed, I already read it 
The good book done said it 
Like cowboys and Indians 

We just living like we bulletproof 
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot) 
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(We gone die, living) 
Living like we bulletproof 
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot) 
Oh we load it, cock it, aim and shoot 
(We gone die, living) 

[Ludacris]
Luda! they say tomorrow’s not promised today 
But today I promise if we don’t make our own way 
Somebody’ll take it from us 
Snatch it like rats to cheese 
So, lord help me please cause I rather die 
on my feet than to live on my knees 
Living like I’m bulletproof 
Xocking the glock and aim n shoot 
My future’s ever clear a 180 proof 
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride 
And drink the pain away 
I take shots and just lay up then fade away 
Dreaming of betta days dreaming of betta pay 
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta pray 
Pray to uphold the week, not for eternal sleep 
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep
