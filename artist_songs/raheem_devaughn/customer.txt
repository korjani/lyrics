[Speaking:]
Good morning, Good afternoon, Good evening, Welcome to Love's can I take your order?
You can have it your way

[Verse 1:]
Welcome, can I help you
Take a minute to read the menu
If you're looking for a man
If you're looking for a friend
If you're looking for someone to talk to
Take your time bout taking your order
I can appetize ya or main course ya
(caution, caution)
Cause the plate is hot (hot)

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm the catch of the day (ay ay ay ay ay)
Your dessert, your meal, your drink (ay ay ay ay ay)
You can find it all in me
I'll fill you up for free
If your heart is hungry
You can place your order here with me

[Chorus:]
Let me serve you up
Lemme lemme serve you up

If you want me supersized with some loving on the side
Just ask for what you want cause your the costumer

Just ask for what you want cause you're the one, you're the costumer

[Verse 2:]
If you got special needs
Picky, you're hard to please
You're particular bout what you like
You're the costumer, it's always right
Satisfaction is gauranteed
Head to toe girl I'm quality
See the window's full of me

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'm gonna whip it up
Whip it up nice and slow
You can even call your in order
I'll deliver to your home
And I'll be there in a matter of seconds
And there's more if you want seconds
You can be greedy as you like
Morning, noon and night
And I'm open 24/7
And cause I like you it's on me
Got a whole lot of sugar and honey
And a plate full of ecstacy
So make your reservations
And make your way to me
And I've got the world for you baby
Tell me where I need to be

Let me serve you up
Lemme lemme serve you up
See you can have it your way
You're the costumer
If you want me supersized with some loving on the side
Just ask for what you want cause your the costumer

Lemme lemme serve you up
Lemme lemme serve you up
See you can have it your way
You're the costumer
You can have me supersized with some lovin on the side
Just ask for what you want cause you're the one, you're the costumer
