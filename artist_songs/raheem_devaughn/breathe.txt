[Spoken:]
The ultimate pleasure's giving pleasure
Yeah, I'm a Taurus...they say that we're patient lovers...Are you a Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn? On the cusp?

[Sing]
If you should feel thirsty, I'll be sure to bring you water
Yes, girl I got candles that will slow burn longer
And I know your favorite love song 
and how you like it on repeat
Me, I was born a patient lover
so I'll start with your feet

[Chorus]
It would be like
When hearts beat as one
It would feel like
No ordinary kiss
You and I
Now close your eyes
And picture us
Breathing life

[Repeat chorus]

I'll do my best to inspire you
To dream of us til we meet again
You may even be encouraged
To take a walk so we can love again
The Most High outdid herself when
She created you
And girl I am thankful
For how our love has bloomed

[Repeat chorus 4x]
