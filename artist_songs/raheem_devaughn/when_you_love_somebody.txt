Love will make you toss and turn, yeah
Make you toss and turn
Love will make you long and yearn, oh yeah

When you love somebody
When you love somebody
When you love somebody

Oooh, it's like magic
You'll be speechless and spell bound
When it's got a hold on you
Ain't it something, (love)
Love got a hold on you, (love's got a hold on you)
It'll make your high feel low
And your low feel high
It'll make your heart feel weak
You won't eat, you won't sleep
Love's got a hold on you
Love will make your lady scratch up your brand new Mercedes
Love will have you drunx texting your ex girlfriend at 3am in the morning
While she's laying with her new love

When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone

You'll be spiteful and vindictive, hey
Ain't it something, When you love somebody
When you love somebody and love's got a hold on you
When you love somebody, love's got a hold on you
It'll make your high feel low
And your low feel high
Love will make you want one, stop spinning around
Ooh and it feels good to love somebody
Love feels good
You, you, you, start thinking 'bout conceiving babies
And manning up, sharing your last name
Walking down the aisle, singing I do

When you love somebody
When you love, love someone
When you love somebody

For that person, that special someone
And I'm telling you there is nothing you won't do
When love, when love, love's got a hold on you
When love, when love's got a hold on you
Man in the special way you love somebody
When love's got a hold on you
Ooh ain't it wonderful when you love somebody
And somebody loves you too
Love's got a hold on you

When you love somebody
Oh when you love someone
(When you love someone)
Yeah, when love's got a hold on you

(When you love somebody)
You might smoke a cigarette
(When you love someone)
You might go to the bar and вrink away your blues
(When you love someone)
When love's got a hold on you
Sometimes, sometimes you cry yourself to sleep when love's got a hold on you
(When you love somebody)
(When you love someone)
And when it feels good, it fells good to sell someone "I love you too"
(When you love somebody)
When you believe somebody
(When you love someone)
When you trust someone
Give your all
(When you love somebody)
You spend your life
(When you love someone)
When you love someone
(When you love somebody)
(When you love someone)
When you love somebody
(When you love somebody)
(When you love someone)
Love someone
When you love somebody
When you love someone, hey

Love somebody, love someone, love somebody, love someone
Love somebody, love someone, love somebody, love someone
Love somebody, love someone, love somebody, love someone
