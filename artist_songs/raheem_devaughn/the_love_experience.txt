Yo peace and love, I wanna tell yall about the beautiful love experience (hope you have time, hope you don't mind) 

To my cousin I'm hoping you can hear this rhyme 
When I ride through the bricks yeah 
I think about you all the time
That cold day I got that phone call 
It plays back in my mind 
I can still hear your mother cry 

Well at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you 

And to my first girlfriend
I know you probably married now
Reminiscing on our prom date
The way I did you yo was kind of foul
But I guess I had to wise up
So now I know better now (but at least I can say)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

Like how it feels 
When it comes
What its like
When it leaves

So to the woman that betrayed me
I think its unfair how
How you chose to deceive me 
I thought that was my child 
Now he's forced inside for now

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

To the faith I've lost ( faith I've lost )
For the friends I've gain ( the friends I've gain )
I'm thinking while I'm questioning change is a good thing
'Cause with dead weight you can't travel light (can't travel light)
Besides I was born to fight so I'm gon' be alright ( born to fight)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you)Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like when it leaves

To my moma, 
To grandma 
To my sister (to my sister)
And say good-bye (to my family)
After departure day and my friends told me what happened oh

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you
(I've experienced love) 

[Chorus:]
I've experinced
The Love experience
You should experience
The love experience 
We are all, all experiments 
Of the love experience 
So just experience

[Reprise:]
We all should experience (la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)
Experience [x2]

[Chorus]
