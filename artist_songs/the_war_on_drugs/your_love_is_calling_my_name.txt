There's a ring on mine looking for a fire
I'm gonna read your minds
It's gonna be alright yeah

I ride the freeway down by the harbor
I catch a strong wind through my mind
I drew a light on the wall for the tallest tier
If there's a line, cross it off for the ragged rails
If there's a weight on you, then it's on me too
We're like a slave, babe, for our love, babe

I ride the freeway down by the harbor
I catch a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it running, I'll take it over

We're just a feeling down by the harbor, babe
I'll catch a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it rolling, I'll take it over
I'll push it over this time

I ride the freeway down by the harbor, babe
And there's a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it running, I'll push it over
Let's take it over this time

I got the feeling down at the harbor
Just like a strong wind through our days
Just keep it rolling, I'll take it over
Let's push it over this way
