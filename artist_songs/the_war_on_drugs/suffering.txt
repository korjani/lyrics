I was here in the world, the world that you gave me every time
You can say that you’re running cuz I can go back on the street
I'll be here when we both gonna fake it 
We're awake 

No more try to hear killing your goal
Means I can be bigger then the tones 
In the moments of suffering
Like the feeling that you gave me, like a snowflake though the fire 
I'll be frozen in time but you'll be here 
Suffering

Will you be here suffering?
Will you be here suffering?
"Well I hope to be"
