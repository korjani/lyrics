All way the babe on the floor
I’m rising in to the top of the line
And I was there waitin’ for the sun
And I was there with the best sometimes

Lookin’ out, past the rubble
Pick yourself up all down the line
I love you babe and I’ll be there till the end
But until then it’s crowded babe

Lookin’ out from somewhere I’ve been thinking
I’ve been rollin’ past the seas
Wonderin’ where my friends are goin’
And wonderin’ why they didn’t take me

Lookin’ out of the window of my room
I’m lookin’ out where somethin’ once ran wild
I’m lookin' down at the window on the floor babe
I’m lookin’ down till I die

Comin’ down like the fire in my heart
Comin’ down like the risin’ in the storm
Comin’ down with a feelin’ I’ve been burned babe
Comin’ down like the fire in my heart babe

Lookin’ out on the field like I’ve been mean
I’m lookin’ down at the tables I’ve turned
And I’m wonderin’ about all my friends down in the combat
Cause I was there with the best sometimes

Lookin’ out, past the rubble
Pick yourself up all down the line
We’ll be stranded but we won’t be forgotten
Down here on the travelin’ bay

My life is filled with fear
I cannot believe in truth
Ooh what am I feelin’
I may have been burned but I can’t believe I’ve been lyin’ on the floor again

And all I see is the darkness in your eyes
It’s like loosin’ ground on the one that I despise
Pick yourself up right down the line
Loose yourself in your mind
