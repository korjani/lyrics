Come on baby, hold me close
Let me do my best to both, 
Let me ride, let it roll

I was there to catch a man
I thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove

Come on baby, let me in
You can show yourself to him
You can show me through the doors

And I was there, catching air
Thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove

We was there, in the road
Picking diamonds from a tree
Heard a wolf coming through

Coming through and coming hard,
Tried to leave the heat and gone
Tried to lean against the wall

I'll be there, coming clean
Like a runner in the wind
Coming through the morning light

Rising in, in the stone
Tried to leave the heat at home
Running through the morning dim

And I was there to catch a man,
I thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove

Come on baby, let me close
Let me do my best to both
Run through but cut close

Come on baby, let me in
You can show yourself to him
Ride the road, ride it rough

Yeah in the day I was gone,
Tried to leave the heat at home
Run through and run the road

I was there, coming clean
Like a runner in the wind
Coming through the morning light

You'll be there, on the floor
Picking diamonds from a stone
Looking through the totem pole
