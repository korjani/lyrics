You've been out on the street
Talkin' bout the war with me
And the background is at night
Don't want to hesitate
Will they tell me where you're hiding?
But through the haze there's no one there.
Wondering if you care.
Callin' out your name in the darkness

When I'm done with my time here
I'm going to keep staying strong
Through the railways
But I never mind going
And I realize now that the road is bare
And I hear it all through the grand parade

And I don't mind you disappearing
'Cause I know you can be found
We be liven' on the dark side of the street, damn.
When we livin' in the moment
And losing our grasp
Making it last with the grand parade in our past

Sometimes I wait for the cold wind to blow
As I struggle with myself right now as I let the darkness in
But I don't mind chasing you through the back ways for the keys
It evaporates and fades like a grand parade

And I don't mind you disappearing
When I know you can be found
When you livin' on the dark side of the street, damn?
We just livin' in the moment, making our past, losin' our grasp through the grand parade

I'll be here or I'll fade away
Never cared about moving, never cared about now
Not the notes I'm playing
Is there room in the dark, in between the changes?
Like a light that's drifting, in reverse I'm moving.
