Come and see
Where are we
This everything
On my knees
To beat it down
To get to my soul
I guessed my way
Anyone can tell it's you coming
But baby, don't mind
Leave it on a lie
Leave it your own way

Come and ride away
It's easier to stick to the earth
Surrounded by the night
Surrounded by the night
And you don't go home
But you abuse my faith
Losing every time but I don't know where
You're on my side again
So ride the key wherever it goes
I'll be the one, I can't, whoo!

You're all I've got to wait
You're running in the dark
When I come to my soul
Try and see it through the dark
It's coming my way
Well we won't get lost inside again babe

Am I right? no one sees you, anyone, around here waiting
They don't mind, they don't hear; I hear
For the best way-oh, you're mine, against it
I would keep you here, but I can't

Oh, I am trying to see the right, right way,
And I don't see it anywhere I go, yeah... woo!

She's on my side again
The easy way
I come to my soul
Walking in the downtown
Talk to my soul
They won't get lost inside again
On my way
I can see it the darkness coming my way
Well we're here
Don't get lost inside
Yeah you won't get lost inside at all
You're on my way
Woo!
