On a drive I'm taking backroads
High against where the rivers are flowing
I didn't think that our love had grown

You had me dead to rights
Hey, I'm trying to get some rest 
To keep on moving

How you been, you looking back
You tried to change your burning boat
Until you realized what you were up against

I spent all those nights
Just trying to take you home
'Til you released me

Cross the bridge
To redefine your pain
The the answer is in your heart

Wide awake
I rearrange the way I listen in the dark
Dreaming of starting up again

So if you look, you'll find yourself
You're not the demon in the dark
That you and I, yea we'd been through that

Can you rectify
All the time it took you
Away from choosing?

So as you find yourself flying high up there
When you release me from your heart again (woo!)
I'm just a burning man trying to keep the ship
From turning over again
Cross the rich derivative of pain
Crush the burning in your heart
Wide awake
To redefine the way you listen in the dark
Dreaming, starting
Like a stranded kid in a doorway
Just burning

Yeah we turn the light in
