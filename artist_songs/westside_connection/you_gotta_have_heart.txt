(Aah, yirr
Yearh, man
Wooh, yo
This rules everything man)

[Chorus]
I don't hurt ya
It will only make you stronger
In this game you gotta have heart
This hustle will brake you down
Pull you apart

[Mack 10]
Homie, the same thing make you laugh, make you cry
And in the fastlane the strong survive and the weak die
Thats the way the ball bounce and i often wonder why
But i nease it all
And not just a piece o' the pie
I used to hope and wish for everything i couldn't buy
I was a young ghetto-boy that grew up in the eye
So i bowed to be a hustler and reach for the sky
And not only a'm i ballin'
Right now is mo' ta' 
It's like a jungle sometime
U gotta hustle sometime
U gotta use your mind, mouth and your muscle sometime
U gotta grind
Stop looking for a savier
Use what the fuck i gave your (flavour)
I'm in the gutter-lane
Whit the gutter-mouth tryin' to get out the gutter
For my life's gutter-out
If i was right and called my mamma a bitch
It wouldn't have took me this to to get this rich (i know)

[Chorus x2]

[WC]
I was raised
The young niggar was scwabble
In the city o' looks
No hope or rolemodels
The black sheap o' the family destent to feel 
Preticted to spend my hole life in a jail-cell
Fucked up and not believe in the hype
I know i would be more then a fellen't
I zoomed up and see the light
Niggar, got my mind right
Niggar, got my grind tight
Now a niggar is gettin' paid to skip 
Skip to the lime-light

[Mack 10]
See, we all got problems
But some need a dress
And so at night i hit my knees and begged him for my blessings
And ask him for forgiveness to minimize my stress
Niggar, continue to know how to dodge this Smith & Wesson
And with his help i will perform in my best
And it's still hard with all this temptation and testenin' 
If i'm wrong
Just accept it as a lesson
As i conquer all my enemies
And mashing with agression, Lord

[Chorus x2]

[Ice Cube]
Ain't never been shoot like 50 Cent or 2Pac
Cuz' 2 shots is too many
Too hot to go in me
I've rather sit remmy
In the back of this Bentley
And only fuck with niggars and you bitches that's friendly
Dont forgive whats so femmé
Cup with my penné
I pull out the semmé
Put hoe's up in Timmy
Just fuck it - it's Babylon
And niggar might have a bomb
Just like the Taliban
But i on never ?lan?

[WC]
I sit alone i my fo'corner room
Loaded ammo
Cuz' in these streets like there's a gamble
And Run-DMC, times is getting harder
So i'm taking of my gold-fandelellin' to the author
Old niggar say to young killers awaked you
But when you got it
Only few homies stay true
This game it's like russian roulette
We hustle to death 
Mash for weather
Make the devil marker for chedder

[Chorus x2]

[Hook:]
[Ice Cube]
Yo!
WON'T YOU JUST STOPPING FUCKING WITH US?
You know what i'm saying

U motherfuckers got everything and you still ain't have it
