[Intro: Knoc-Turn'al]
Now that's cool
You know
I chill wit ch'all though a little bit
Fuck the music
I ain't give a fuck about that nigga
And he came hittin my weed
He came drinkin my Hen'
Matter fact if I see him in traffic, even know y'all fuck with him
It's on

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go (let's go)
Would ya party on with me? (get it crackin in this motherfucker)
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
On the mic I been a deamon since seamen
How you screamin': Oh mama, here come that young O'Sama
With that Al-Quaida drama
Fuck no
It's the Dalai Lama, wit that West World Order
Now MC's Bow Down and treat me like Yoda
When they catch me in the corner after club
Like "nigga whuut", they t'ow up the dub
So you can tell Samuel L. I'ma keep ac'in
You can even tell that motherfucker Jassie Jackson
Pay your child suport, keep your payments up
Put a rubber on and don't fuck wit us

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go
Would ya party all with me?
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
Mack pull up in the rag, Cevy layed the ass
And crumble green on a Zig-Zag and lacein' with hash
I keep a 9mm cocked and ready to blast
So when the phone jump off a nigga ready to smash
I drink my 'gnac out the bottle
I don't fuck wit a glass
And I ain't sip trippin dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it I bound it fast
Or I'm creepin through your window breakin out your glass
Then I rob the whole party lookin through a ski-mask, c'mon

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go
Would ya party all with me?
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Verse 3: W.C.]
From the land of the Lakers, bird brakers, Impala Peddles
While we chop dollars wit those in Supremo's
It's the check a hoe, when the cutlass checkin doe
So so ghetto Dub let's rep the boat

Ball griddy but a crew a hog's wit me
And V.I.P. yo from mad dog 20/20
Dub C. chunkin up at 23th
And better go still swiss hangin' like a testicle

Lick 1, 2 to the nose, my butt was swaz, huh
Take my picture, trick my foe's posein' like the heisman
I'm burnin' money, tryna slice some in you tummy (what)
Leave your panties gummy, have you walkin funny, trick

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al X2]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go
Would ya party all with me?
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Female Sings]
Ooooo...Lights Out
Ooooo...Lights Out 
Ooooo...Lights Out
