Now you go unseen, perfect you'll stay hidden
And I can dream of things you'll never see
Alli, please, if you are braver than the rest
There's little left who could dispute your claim

And when you'd finally gone
He tells me you were dead all along
He was wrong, he hadn't lived a day
The way you lived your final days, a teenager in love with Christ and heroin

Now you feel ashamed but he feels nothing of the kind
He talks of things he wouldn't mind to try sometime
But you've got little left to give
His touch is not a thing you'll ever miss

And when you'd finally gone
He tells me you were dead all along
He was wrong, he hadn't lived a day
The way you lived your final days, a teenager in love with Christ and heroin

A teenager in love with Christ and heroin

And if you made a stand
I would stand with you 'til the end
But you don't need a friend when you're a
Teenager in love with Christ and heroin

A teenager in love with Christ and heroin
