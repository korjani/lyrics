You say you've been waiting, waiting for someone
Waiting for some song, waiting since when you were born
For a moment when everything's alright and everything's all white
But I just can't wait anymore

Hey Paul, where have you gone?
I want to come along
Hey Paul, what went so wrong?
What went so wrong?

Have you gone away or been left behind?
You know that I don't mind, you know that you're my kind
'Cause when I hear church bells or when I see fireflies
You don't know I won't lie, one of these days you'll belong

Hey Paul, where have you gone?
I want to come along
Hey Paul, what went so wrong?

Hey Paul, where have you gone?
I want to come along
Hey Paul, what went so wrong?
What went so wrong?

Hey Paul, where have you gone?
I want to come along
Hey Paul, what went so wrong?
I want to come along
