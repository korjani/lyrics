Wrap me up or shoot me down,
just keep me close to you
I feel so wrong when the curtain’s drawn
Are you coming to?

If we’d stay clean what could we be?
I guess I’ll never know
But say to me you’ll stay with me
until the sun explodes

Tell me now you know somehow
things will turn out right
If we stay dressed in our funeral best
and sleep with open eyes

But you don’t look right in the hospital light
breathing soft and slow
But I’ll say to you I’ll stay with you
until the sun explodes
