Hunt me with your blackened eyes,
would you run to the end of the world?
Tell me how you can’t be kind,
would you run to the end of the world?

‘Cuz I know you’re violent, and I know you’re true,
and there’s a thousand lives you’d like to try
but never do
But if you come with me, we could find just two

Kelly tell me all you like
If it’s filthy films and swill I think we just might

Kelly tell me all you’d live without
If it’s quotes as jokes and coke
we should hang around

Passed out on the train again,
woke up at the end of the world
So you’re a lush with a healthy mistrust
of any man who says you must

be someone’s baby, or nobody at all,
with a thousand lives so circumscribed
they’re not lives at all
but if you come with me, we could lose them all

Tell me everything
