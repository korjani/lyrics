If you shut out the sun, then the day will never come
If you turn on your side, then this night won't come undone
Now you say you need a friend
But we can't live again

Monday morning comes too fast, you stumble down the diamond path
And every step will be your last
The sunken eyes you just can't see, remind me how you'll never leave
And every breath could be your last

Now you stand in the rain saying nothing has changed at all
Save the lines in your eyes that remind me of summer's fall
Oh no, you say you need a friend
But we can't live again

Monday morning comes too fast, you stumble down the diamond path
And every step will be your last
The sunken eyes you just can't see, remind me how you'll never leave
And every breath could be your last
