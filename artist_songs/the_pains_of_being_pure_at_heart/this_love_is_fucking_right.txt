Sweet sister
Can't you find the words to say?
Your mister
He don't treat you the right way

In a dark room I can see you shining bright
You don't have to tell me twice, it's alright
In a dark room we can do just as we like
You're my sister and this love is fucking right

Can you go home?
Look your best friend in the eye
No, you can't go home
After where you slept last night

In a dark room I can see you shining bright
You don't have to tell me twice, it's alright
In a dark room we can do just as we like
You're my sister and this love is fucking right

In a dark room I can see you shining bright
You don't have to tell me twice, it's alright
In a dark room we can do just as we like
You're my sister and this love is fucking right
