Come on down
The furthest reaches of your nowhere town
They suck you in
The black hole kids won't let you free again

Don't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the sky
Tonight we'll stay alive
Don't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the sky
Tonight we'll stay alive

When it's gone
You sit and stare until the golden dawn
Can't you see?
His arms are hell and you won't ever leave

Don't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the sky
Tonight we'll stay alive
Don't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the sky
Tonight we'll stay alive
