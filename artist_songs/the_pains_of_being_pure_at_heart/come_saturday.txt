I can't stand to see your picture
On the dresser where I left it
Another sunny day and you're 80 miles away
Tuesday

But come Saturday, you'll come to stay
You'll come to sway in my arms
Who cares if there's a party somewhere?
We're gonna stay in

Come Saturday, you'll come to say
Maybe there's no harm
In a wasted summer with no drummer
We're gonna stay in

I could stand to be a fixture
In your faded family picture
But I can't see into the sunset
All I know is that you're perfect right now

Come Saturday, you'll come to stay
You'll come to sway in my arms
Who cares if there's a party somewhere?
We're gonna stay in

Come Saturday, you'll come to say
Maybe there's no harm
In a wasted summer with no drummer
We're gonna stay in

You don't have to write at all, you don't have to make a call
I know that you will come again and again
You don't have to dress to please, perhaps undress for me
I know that when you come we'll be staying in
