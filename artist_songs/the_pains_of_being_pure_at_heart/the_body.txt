Come on now stop staring at the ceiling
Your last daydream is slowly unreeling
Won't you come out tonight, like I know you want to
Cuz the city's alive and even though it haunts you, I want you

To tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I want to hurt like it did before
We shouldn't sin

Tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I lost mine and I need yours,
It's only skin, we could swim

You try so hard to keep it together,
And you look so hard in fishnets and leather
But I know who you are, you are just a lost saint
And if we go too far, there'll be heaven to pay
And what a price…

I can't feel it anymore, tell me again what the body's for
I can't feel it anymore, tell me again it's only skin, we should swim
