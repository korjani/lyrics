O Claire

Bye bye love goodbye
See you on the other side
Bye bye love goodbye
I'll see you on the other side

Hurry on home to bed
O Claire you're much younger than I'd ever hoped to be
O Claire it's so lonely when you're not there
Anyone can take me where
the places that they weren't there
O Claire

I hear your heart from here
But now you're much stronger than I'd ever hoped to be
I swear gone a place beyond compare
So lonely when you're not there
I'm content to watch and stare
O Claire

Just between the 2 of us
Something 'tween the 2 of us
Is more than just the 2 of us
Just between the 2 of us
O my love goodbye
O my love goodbye

Hurry on home to bed
Claire you're much stronger than I'd ever hoped to be
O Claire the nights when you're not there
Is more than I can bear
Something only we can share
O Claire

Just between the 2 of us
Something 'tween the 2 of us
Is more than just the 2 of us
Just between the 2 of us
O my love goodbye
O bye love goodbye

Bye bye love goodbye
I'll See you on the other side
Bye bye love goodbye
See you on the other side
Bye bye love goodbye

Just between the 2 of us
Something 'tween the 2 of us
It's more than just the 2 of us
Just between the 2 of us
O my love goodbye
O my love 

Bye bye love goodbye
See you on the other side
Bye bye love goodbye
I'll see you on the other side
