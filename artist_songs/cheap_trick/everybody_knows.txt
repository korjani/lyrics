Caught in the storm, lost in the sea
Damned for the crew and me
The captain he cries so many tears
Lost 'till eternity

And the bough she'll break
From the pounding waves

All aboard abandon the ship
Everybody knows
All ashore are drowned in the seas
As your lives will pass before your eyes

Caught in the act as a matter of fact
Her pants down to her knees
Saved by the bell, oh bloody hell
Take your positions please

And for those who sail
Through the pounding gale

All aboard abandon the ship
Everybody knows
All ashore are drowned in the seas
As your lives will pass before your eyes

Tell me over and over, baby well it's alright
And tell me it's not over
And we'll go on and on and on

All aboard abandon the ship
Everybody knows
All ashore are drowned in the seas
As your lives will pass before your eyes

Everybody knows
That's the way things go
All the ties that bind
Heaven knows they'll flash before your eyes

Everybody knows
That's the way things go
All the ties that bind
