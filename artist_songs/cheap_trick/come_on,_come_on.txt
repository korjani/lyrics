Ooo I'm feelin' good
Oh so good
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when
Ooo treat me, treat me, treat me right
Don't be like sheep and follow the flock
Show me you really want to be mine

Ooo I'm feelin' good
Oh so good
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when
Ooo treat me, treat me, treat me right
Don't be like sheep and follow the flock
Show me you really want to be mine

Come on, come on
I know you can do it
Come on, come on
There ain't nothing to it
Come on, come on
I know you believe me
Come on, come on
You can see the real me
Every day, every day
I need you, I want you
Come a little closer to my face
Oh little girl
I need you now
