Hush little darling, don't you cry.
Daddy's coming home, coming home tonight.
No bed of roses for your head, for you.
You see no future, it's all in the past.
This is a nightmare, won't be your last.
It's hard to admit, it's hard to admit you're that blind.

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye.
Mommy and Daddy don't see when we cry.
Mommy and Daddy they don't understand.
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands.

Sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Woke up with a monster. Ah.   
Sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Woke up with a monster. Ah.   

Hush little darling, don't be long.
Momma's little angel can't do nothing wrong.
No bed of roses in your head, for you.
Who'll dry your tear when you cry?
Daddy's comin' home just in time.
Will, he be the one to make it, to help make it right?

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye.
Mommy and Daddy make each other cry.

Sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Woke up with a monster. Ah.   
Sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Woke up with a monster. Ah.   

Not sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Not sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye.
Mommy and Daddy don't hear when we cry.

Mommy and Daddy don't see eye to eye.
Mommy and Daddy don't see when we cry.
Mommy and Daddy they don't understand.
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands.

Sleeping with an angel. Ah.   
Woke up with a monster. Ah.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ow.
