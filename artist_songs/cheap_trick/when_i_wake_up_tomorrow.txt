I never thought that it would be like this before
I never wanted just one kiss for sure
Well, maybe I didn't understand
All you wanted was a one night stand, well
Never thought that I would beg like this for more

These days I wonder how I'm gonna make it tomorrow
These ways I'll have to beg if I want to borrow
My love, here I'm on my knees
Please be here when I wake up tomorrow

I never felt like this before
My love is flowing out for sure
Your lips upon my skin
Come out and let me in now
Never thought I'd beg like this for more

These days I wonder how I'm gonna make it tomorrow
In these ways I'm praying there's no need for sorrow
These days I wonder what will come of tomorrow
These ways I'll have to beg if I want to borrow
Your love, here I'm on my knees
Please be here when I wake up tomorrow
