Wait for the man to call
I need it fast as I can
I've been shaking all over
It's got me drummin' my hands

I've been thinking 'bout the thought on my brain
About to drive me insane
There ain't no safety you feel that thing
I press the buttons again

You reckon you've got everything to die for
Decaf is here again
It's what I live and breathe and lie for

It's X o'clock and I'm waiting
Waitin' for the call
In the sweat I keep pacin'
It's time to get on the ball

I've been thinking 'bout pulling the chain
Cause now I'm past insane
There aint no safety you take that step, yeah
You live without your cane

You reckon you've got everything that I'd die for
Decaf is here again
It's what I live and breathe and die for

Well it could happen to you
Well it could happen to you

Yeah it could happen to you
Yeah it could happen to you
And it could happen to you
Yeah it can happen to you

You reckon you've got everything to die for
Decaf is here again
It's what I live and breathe and lie for

You reckon you've got everything to die for
Decaf is here again
It's what I live and breathe and die for

It's gonna happen to you
Well it could happen to you
