Every night I can play it
Every day I can say it
Oh, if I cry I won't delay it
Every night and every day

I guess I'm living for the moment
I guess you're loving for today
Yeah, here is where we're going
Or are we going to stay?
Oh, really need you more than want you
But I still want you to stay

Every night I can play it
Every day I can say it
Oh, if I cry I won't delay it
Every night and every day

Is your today really taking?
My today is really breaking
Is that my heart that keeps on aching
Or will it fade away?
Oh, will I see you again tomorrow
Every night and every day

What if we leave our past
Hoping these lonely nights won't last?
Tired of the same old lies
In the key of life

I could be waiting for an hour
I could be waiting half a day
I really need you more than want you
But you really know that anyway
Some days I love you more than others, yeah
Some others I just want a day??

Every night I can play it
Every day I can say it
Oh, if I cry I won't delay it
Every night and every day

Is your today really taking?
My today is really breaking
Is that my heart that keeps on aching
Or will it fade away?
Oh, will I see you again tomorrow
Every night and every day

What if we leave our past
Hoping these lonely nights won't last?
Tired of the same old lies
In the key of life
In the key of life
In the key of life
In the key of life
