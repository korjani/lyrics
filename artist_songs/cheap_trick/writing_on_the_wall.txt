All right, I saw the writing on the wall.
All night, I saw the writing on the wall, 
I saw the writing on the wall.

Lo and behold, heard it on the radio.
It was a long time comin', but it sounds so sweet,
Come on, man, get off my back.

All right, I saw the writing on the wall.
All night, I saw the writing on the wall, 
I saw the writing on the wall.

In the Midwest and in the East.
Canada, Southwest, around the world,
L.A., Tokyo, sounds so sweet, 
Come on honey, get on your feet.

All right, I saw the writing on the wall.
All night, I saw the writing on the wall, 
I saw the writing on the wall.

The words were oh, so...
The words were oh, so clear.

All right, I saw the writing on the wall.
All night, I saw the writing on the wall, 
I saw the writing on the wall.

Lo and behold, heard it on the radio.
It was a long time comin', but it sounds so sweet,
Come on, man, get off my back.
Saw it at the airport, it was on T.V.
Read it in a magazine, runnin' down the street.
Makes no sense, but I hope it's gonna last, 
the next big thing, I really gotta laugh.
Worked and slaved and played like hell, 
Everybody's goin' crazy, you're the last to know.
Can't explain it, still a joke to me,
Maybe I'm naive, 'cause it's so plain to see.

It's right in front of your face, man.
It's right in front of your face, man.
Played like hell, whoa!
Played like hell, whoa!
