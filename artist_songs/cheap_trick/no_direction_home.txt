Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh

Gotta get back to the train on time
Nothing else seems to matter
Gotta get back gonna lose my mind
Everything's getting better

I never gonna break, never gonna fall
I'm never gonna crack, never gonna crawl
Know that I can, I'll take my time
Everything I am it's all in my mind

No matter which way you're going
I wanna go, no direction home for me
Up, down, all around I wanna go with you
No direction home for me

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh

Gonna sink into this brain of mine
Nothing else seems to matter
So damn close, gonna lose my mind
Somehow it's getting better

I never gonna break, never gonna fall
I'm never gonna crack, never gonna crawl
Know that I can, I'll take my time
Everything I am it's all in my mind

No matter which way you're going
I wanna go, no direction home for me
Up, down, all around I wanna go with you
No direction home for me

Never gonna break, never gonna fall
Never gonna crack and I'm never gonna crawl
Everything I am it's all in my mind
No direction home for me

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah oh

No direction
No direction

No matter which way you're going, I wanna go too
No direction home for me
Up, down, all around I wanna go with you
No direction home for me

I'm never gonna break, never gonna fall
Never gonna crack and I'm never gonna crawl
Everything I am it's all in my mind
No direction home for me
