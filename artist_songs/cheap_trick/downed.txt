Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head

I'm gonna live on a mountain
Way down under in Australia
It's either that or suicide
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I got a mind
Over you it's not the first time
Ooh, I got a mind

Rainbow's crawling on a midday sun
But I've been lucky you're the only one
Sunday's calling, you'll be number one
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, you think of Jesus Christ
You walk on water but don't bet your life, oh no
All you walk is a fine line
It's such a strange strain on you

Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head

Too many people want to save the world
Another problem is it a boy or girl
Some say the weekend is the only world
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I've got a mind
Over you it's not the first time
All you walk is a fine line
It's such a strange strain on you

Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
