This is the beginning
Somehow it feels like an ending
Spoken like a true beginner
We're gonna get there

Such a strange decision
To fight to the finish
Only just to say, "Are we finished?"
We're gonna get there
Give my number to God
Give my phone to my best friend
Tell him call up all my enemies
And tell them it's all good, it's all good, it's all good
I know I wish I could, wish I could
I should say thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
I should say thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
