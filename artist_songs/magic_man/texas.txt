It's been a while, and I've been alone
and you've been the only thing I've known
Born in the South, at home in the North
We could be anywhere you want

Now you're taking me down where you grew up
I wish I had known you when we were young
You figured me out, I know I've said it enough
but waiting is just too much

So cover my skin with your sunkissed light
There's a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

Picture it now, down the road
Oh just say the word and I'll go
Wherever you are, whatever the coast
You are the one I care for the most

Remember the night we slept on the roof?
I didn't sleep much to tell the truth
Now we're the sand caught in the tide
We laugh until we cry

Won't you cover my skin with your sunkissed light
There's a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

Pull me closer, hold me tighter
The nights are long but the stars are brighter
Pull me closer, hold me tighter
Take me down, take me down, take me down

Won't you cover my skin with your sunkissed light
There's a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline
