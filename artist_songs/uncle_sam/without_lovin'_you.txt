What's wrong baby?
What's goin' on?
I don't understand, ya know?
Won't you tell me what's wrong
We been together for too long
For you to just throw it all away
Talk to me
I wanna know how you feel
Cause baby, I care
So tell me, what's the deal?

[Uncle Sam:]
What have I done
To make you go away
I can't understand why you don't wanna stay, oh
Was it somethin' I said
To make you feel this way
Baby I'm sorry
Please give me a chance to make a brighter day
Lady tell me what...

[Johnny, Shawn & Uncle Sam:]
What can I say or do
For you
To know that my heart is true
My love
Turn my gray skies to blue
Cause I can't go on without lovin' you

[Uncle Sam:]
Can I, can I re-write the chapter in our lives
Where we went wrong
Cause your love's been around for oh so long
And I can't believe that it's over
Not able to love, kiss & hold you
Baby that ain't cool, oh
Why you treating me oh so cruel
Now tell me what...

[Johnny, Shawn & Uncle Sam:]
What can I say or do
For you
To know that my heart is true
My love
Turn my gray skies to blue
Cause I can't go on without lovin' you

[Uncle Sam:]
Ohh, so tell me what must I do...

[Shawn & Uncle Sam:]
Can we start our love over again?
(Can we start all over again?)
It's in your hands baby, don't let it end
(It's in your hands, baby)
Cause I can't see a thing without your love to guide my way
(Guide my way)
Baby, come back to me to stay

[Johnny, Shawn & Uncle Sam:]
What can I say or do
For you
To know that my heart is true
My love
Turn my gray skies to blue
Cause I can't go on without lovin' you
