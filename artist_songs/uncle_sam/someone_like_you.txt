Never knew love was real
Until you walked into my life, uhh
My every fantasy was made true before my eyes
You came right on time
Put a new smile upon my face
I'm no longer outta order
Everything fell right in place

You gave love just as good as you recieved
Oooh, it's been a long time
Since I ever felt the need to have a woman around
I need...

Someone like you
To hold me oh so tight
I need someone like you
To give me all her love and more
I want someone like you
To satisfy my yearning heart
I gotta have someone like you
You

Never thought that anyone could understand my moody ways
And they played in the sunshine
But when it rained, they couldn't stay
They didn't give me the difference
That I had to have around me
You made love very possible
When I started to disbelieve

You gave a lot to someone who was long gone
Helped me get over
Gave me strength to carry on
Helped me move on
I need...

Someone like you
To hold me oh so tight
I need someone like you
To give me all her love and more
I want someone like you
To satisfy my yearning heart
I gotta have someone like you
You

Someone like you
Someone like you to hold me oh so tight
I need someone like you
Ahhh, baby I want someone...
I want someone like you
To satisfy my loveless heart
I gotta have someone like you
You

Never thought I could ever feel this way
Baby girl, I want you to stay
With me is where you need to be
Right here with me, baby
Gotta have your love every minute of the day
Keep you satisfied in every way
I'll take you to your ecstasy

All I need
Oh, listen to me baby
Look into my eyes
And hear what I say

Someone like you
Oh, to set my world on fire
I need someone like you
Whoa, to satisfy my heart's desire, baby
I want someone like you
Whoa, you're my shining star
I'll follow you wherever you are
I gotta have someone like you
Hold me
You

Someone like you
You make me wanna sing
I need someone like you
Yeah, you make me wanna love you babe
I want someone like you
Thank God for givin' me your love
I gotta have someone like you
You
