Here I lay all alone
Tossin turnin
Longing for some of your
Tender love
I'm waitin 4 the right
Moment to come
So i can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me

Tender love (tender love)
Love so tender (aaaaaaah)
Holdin me close to you
Baby I surrender

Candles fade like the dark
Now I see how
Loving a feeling's for
All the tender love you've given to me
I want you more and more
Can't resist you
More than I feel your touch
Tender love
Lovin me straight from the heart
Holy mirror
Please let me be a part
Of all the tender love you've given to me

Tender love (tender love)
Love so tender (aaaaaaah)
Holdin me close to you
Baby I surrender

Ooooooooooooh...yeah...surrender baby....ooooooh...
