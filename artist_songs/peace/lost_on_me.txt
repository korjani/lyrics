(Ha-ahhh)
I've an empty room
Inside this chew
You need no name
The old and bruised
In stolen shoes
You feel the same, baby
Not on what you wear
Or length of hair
Is at ease to define
The [?]
The sound from your lips
Is truly divine

You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits
The lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

(Ha-ahhh)
I've a royal love
Not common blood
Let me colour your bones
Sometimes the simplest thing
Elegant stint
Resounds the most

You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits
The lightning from your lips
It's lost on me
(Get lost on me)
(Get lost on me)

Chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits
The lightning from your lips
It's lost on me
(Get lost on me)
(Get lost on me)

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits
The lightning from your lips
It's lost on me
(Get lost on me)
(Get lost on me)
