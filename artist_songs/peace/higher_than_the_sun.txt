Aurora creep, I wanna sleep forever
It seems as though you never go to bed
You take the dollar, I'll take the dime
Everything'll turn out right
You know you're fun, I'll take the jump
All I wanna know is how high

Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun

When in doubt I think about the ending
Wipe your eyes and strip down to your bones
You take the dollar, I'll take the dime
Anything'll turn out right
Tapping your teeth, shivering feet
The boulevard got so bright

Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
You wanna play it cool, you wanna be the man
You wanna hold my heart in your hand
But you know that the truth, is just the fruit of the fool

Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
You wanna play it cool, you wanna be the man
You wanna hold my heart in your hands
But you know that the truth, is just the fruit of the fool
