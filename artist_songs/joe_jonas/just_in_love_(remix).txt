[Joe Jonas:]
Love a girl in a whole another language
People look at us strange
Don't understand us, they try to change it
I try to tell her don't change

Talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why you wanna change it
(Girl, listen to me)

You're just running from the truth
But I'm scared of losing you
You are worth too much to lose
Baby, if you're still confused

Girl, I'm just in love with you
Girl, I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you
Oh yeah

[Lil Wayne:]
Ain't no love like the one I got
I'm a prisoner of love
Got my heart on lock
It's like a star from the sky
Fell by my side
And she tell me that it's mine
And I say that's fine
And she look like a butterfly
Smell like a flower
Man, we go together like
Money and the power
And I don't need nothing
Nothing but her
'Cause all them other bitches
Ain't fucking with her
And the smile on her face
Make the world a better place
But she out of this world
So we somewhere out in space
Making love like animals
Planet of the apes
All night
All morning
Too bright for this place
Man, we just doing what we does
The tank on e
Yeah, just enough
And we just be, yeah, just because
Don't worry about me
I'm just in love
Joe

[Joe Jonas:]
Girl, I'm just in love
Girl, I'm just in love with you
Do you hear what I said?
I'm just in love with you
Can nobody change it
No other words to use
I love you, baby!
I'm just in love with you [repeat]

Whoa
Never knew what we have
They don't understand
We're just a waste of time
We know this is real
I don't know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine

Girl, I'm just in love with you
Girl, I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
Let me say it again, let me say it again
I'm just in love with you [repeat]
