I came to do my dance
I'm 'bout to touch the town
I came to lift my hands
I came to shut this thing down

I came to do my dance
I'm 'bout to touch the town
I came to lift my hands
I came to shut this thing down, down, down

[Chorus]
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I want more of it
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I think I love it

She's a killa! Straight up, no feelings, uh-huh
If you ain’t heard about her, she’s a stone cold dream stealer, uh-huh
Love slayer, most likely I’ll be on my worst behavior, oh ooh
She’ll love you up all night but I’m ready to stay up
I just came to!

I came to do my dance
I'm 'bout to touch the town
I came to lift my hands
I’m ’bout to shut this thing down

[Chorus]
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I want more of it
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I think I love it

Head banger
Better beware of danger, ahhh
I hope you like livin' on the wild side, cause she’s no stranger
Love slayer, most likely I’ll be on my worst behavior, oh ooh
She’ll love you up all night but I’m ready to stay up
I just came to!

I came to do my dance
I'm 'bout to touch the town
I came to lift my hands
I’m ‘bout to shut this thing down

[Chorus]
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I want more of it
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I think I love it

And all of my friends, they tried to warn me
They told me she would haunt me
But I gotta be, yeah, I gotta be,
I gotta be the life of the party
Told my friends that she won’t hurt me,
I'm in control, don’t worry
She’s known to be, she’s known to be,
Yeah, She’s known to be a

[Chorus]
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
And I want more of it
Love slayer, causing nothing but trouble, babe
Love slayer, Love slayer, Love slayer

I came to do my dance
I'm 'bout to touch the town
I came to lift my hands
I came to shut this thing down
