And again I wait for you
My tired hands are turning blue
I'm not sure if it's night or day
My body's aching in the cold and rain
But, I can't go home in case you're on the next train
So, here I stand - I'm just waiting for you

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Playing games I turn around 
I kick my heals I count the clowns 
I watch another lonely man 
Oh, but there's something in the air 
that says I'm in the right place
So, I gaze at the crowd I'm trying to find the right face 
And there it is - You say you're sorry too

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Well, there's a hole in the ground 
that seems to eat me up 
I can't say enough about the two of us
My arms are breaking I can't hold you enough 

Oh, I can't hold you enough
Oh, I can't hold you enough
I want to love you again 
I want to love you again 
I want to love you again 
I want to love you again
I want to love you again 
I want to love you again 
I want to love you again
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

Everybody I know has to face the trains 
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Well, I took you to a glycerine party everynight 
I followed on my lead when you put out the light 
I couldn't fight the feeling that it's warmer than rain
I couldn't fight the feeling that you can't fight trains cause I know

Nobody tastes like you 
Nobody looks like you
Nobody loves like you
Nobody tastes like you 
Nobody looks like you
I can't go home
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

(What did you say?)
I said a lot of things that I didn't mean 
(tell me why?) 
Cause I was hungry for your sweet 16 
(so you lied?) 
Oh, just to keep you here you're so naive 
I get so lost and lame 
Like on a ball and chain but, I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again 
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes 
Don't let the trains get'ya
