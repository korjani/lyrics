Don't think I told you 'bout this dream I had 
Me and these friends of mine were feelin' bad 
'Cause we were wasted 
Wasted on the likes of You

Feel like a semaphoring Happy Jack 
Caucasion crucifix upon our backs 
Yeah, we were wasted 
Wasted on the likes of You

Well we've got powers in our jeans You've never dreamed 
And we've got words You've never heard and never seen 
Yeah, we've been wasted

I heard you hummin' on the telephone 
I spoke to Monroe, Garbo, Truman, Capone 
But, they were wasted 
Wasted on the likes of You

Oh, come along 
Come along
Come along
Come along

I met a man today who sold me an icecream
I took his number down in case we were seen 
He looked so much better

I took my first real taste of porcupine tea 
Loretta looked much better than you'd think she could be 
She looked so much better 
I really think she rule it out

I think I'll take a look at what I could be 
She showed me lots of things that I'd never seen
'Cause she was wasted
Wasted on the likes of You

Maybe one day we can stop on the screen 
And lay back royalties from me unseen 
Cause we've been wasted 
Wasted on the likes of You, yeah, You, yeah 
Wasted on the likes of You, yeah, You, yeah 
Wasted on the likes of You, yeah, You, yeah 
Wasted on the likes of You, yeah, You, yeah 
Wasted on the likes of You
