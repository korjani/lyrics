What am I supposed to do
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on
I broke all your records 
And I played all your rules
I sold you down the road
I was nobody's fool in my schooldays - my schooldays

What am I supposed to feel
Sitting here in this eternity wheel
With my frown on
Here come my friends
they're gotta help me pull through 
Oh, help me out of this emergency room
With my suitcase - my suitcase

What am I supposed to learn
Sitting here in this electrical storm
With no shoes on
Hey mister, won't you leave me alone
I think I need to use your telephone
Call my lawyer, my liar

I took a walk in the park
I tried a kiss in the dark
I was trying to make you love me
I took an overdose
Of the perfume on your clothes
I was trying to make you happy

What am I supposed to say
I didn't like her that much anyway
She was screaming
Here comes the Judge he's gonna help me pull through
Oh, help me out of this emergency room
With my suitcase - my suitcase

What am I supposed to do
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on

Hey, mama don't you cry over me
I'm lost and lonely but that's O.k by me
That's just my way, just my way

Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good

Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good

What am I supposed to learn
Sitting here in this electrical storm
With no shoes on

Hey mister, won't you hold my hand
I need a friend to find the promised land
Won't you touch me, please touch me

What am I supposed to do
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on
Hey mister, won't you cry over me
I'm lost and lonely but that's OK. by me
That's just my way, just my way

I took a walk in the park
I tried a kiss in the dark
I was trying to make you love me
I took an overdose 
Of the perfume on your clothes
I was trying to make you happy
