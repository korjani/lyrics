It makes all the difference in the universe,
To be with you at night, but it only makes it worse
In the daytime.

But when I see you in the evening,
Well that's all right.
I forget about the day,
Cause you're mine all night.

But in the morning there's that feeling again,
Another nine hours until I meet your train
At the station.

So I spend all day
On the telephone,
Just telling you I miss you
And I'm all alone.

And every day I dream my life away,
Just waiting for the weekend.
Then I know I won't have to leave you here,
And we can be alone again.

Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend to come.

I don't need money and I don't need crime,
I get my kicks from spending all my time
Here beside you.

That's why I'm standing on the corner
In the freezing cold,
Just waiting for my girl
From another world.

And every day I dream my life away,
Just waiting for the weekend.
Then I know I won't have to leave you here,
And we can be alone again.

Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend to come.

And every day I dream my life away,
Just waiting for the weekend.
Then I know I won't have to leave you here,
And we can be alone again.

Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend to come.

Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend,
Waiting for the weekend to come.
