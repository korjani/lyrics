I've seen it before
I know the score
You're trying to be wild and carefree 
You really can't take it no more

I'm trying to think 
I can't think clear 
Everybody's talking at me 
It's gone foggy in here

But as time goes marching home again 
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time?
Or was this time well spent?

And if it marches back again 
And orders me to smile 
Then will I be prepared?
Or will it take a little while?

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

I've listened to you
Please listen to me 
Don't tie us up completely 
Just wait and see

I'll try very hard for a second chance
Which is it to be? One dead romance
Or a handful of dreams? Please tell me
It makes all the difference to me
And I really want to know
I've tried so many things I suddenly regret
If I could only compromise and you'd try to forget 
A single kiss, a lover's wish, the past dissolves in tears 
The present burns inside of me, the future disappears

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Oh yes I will and I'll go out of my way to make you happy 
Till the sun don't shine and sky stops turning blue
I really want to know 
Could I ever be happy without somebody who really cared
Somebody like you

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Yes I will
