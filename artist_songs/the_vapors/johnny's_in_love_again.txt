The sky is grey
He's off for the day
Cos Johnny don't care what the company say
His cold wet forehead has a strain to take
But he smiles for a while
Cos Johnny's in love again

It's loud and red
There's a hole in it's head
Cos Johnny's started on the pistol break
His cold wet forehead has a strain to take
But he smiles for a while
Cos Johnny's in love again

But my friend Johnny's got a lot to enjoy

He don't hang around with the rest of the boys
He sits with his sandwiches gun in hand
Singing 'loves me, loves me not'
And popping off Gods toys
Johnny's in love again

Lost without a trace
In the fields behind his place
And he'll keep on pumping till they all come down
His cold wet forehead wears a bright blue frown
But he smiles for a while
Cos Johnny's in love again
