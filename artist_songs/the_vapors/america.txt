Why don't you get out of here
I never needed you anyway
Why don't you just disappear
I'm tired of driving down your logical motorway
You could stay if you don't ask no questions
You could stay if you don't tell no lies
Say You don't read my feature

You could stay if you don't read my mind
Wanna do something new

I Wanna go to America
Go to America
Go to America
But I wanna stay with you

But I wanna take you too baby
Baby, baby, baby

For a moment I'm alive
Everybody tries to steal my time
(I tell you)

Just hiding out in this occupied territory
God knows how I can survive

You could stay if you don't ask no questions

You could stay if you don't tell no lies

Say you don't read my feature
You could stay if you don't read my mind
Wanna do something new

I Wanna go to America
Go to America

Go to America
But I wanna stay with you

But I wanna take you too baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I wanna go to America

Go to America
Go to America
But I wanna stay with you

But I wanna take you too baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby
