By the time you get this message I'll be down
You may recognize my elementary sound
But we can freeze time
We can freeze time
But sometimes I just get trapped in neon signs
It helps me when I read between the lines
But we can freeze time
Yeah we can freeze time

But when the daylight titans around me
I pack up all my problems and run
When the daylight titans surround me
I don't know what I'm doing
But I've got to get things done

Don't you ever let your problems get you down
If you just pick up the phone I'll come around
And we can freeze time
Yeah we can freeze time

But I've got so much important work to do
It's so hard to stop it bleeding me and you
Now we can freeze time
Yeah we can freeze time

But when the daylight titans around me
I pack up all my problems and run
When the daylight titans surround me
I don't know what I'm doing
But I've got to get things done

All over the world I run and hide
I slip and slide exactly like the last time
All over the world they come and go
Not you, this could be the last time

But what hurts me is I never get the time
To say or do even half of what I'm feeling
When my feeling is for you
But we can freeze time
Yeah we can freeze time
So don't you ever let the problems get you down
If you just pick up the phone I'll come around
And we can freeze time
Yeah we can freeze time

But when the daylight titans around me
I pack up all my problems and run
When the daylight titans surround me
I don't know what I'm doing
But I've got to get things done

But when the daylight titans around me
I pack up all my problems and run
When the daylight titans surround me
I don't know what I'm doing
But I've got to get things done, son!
