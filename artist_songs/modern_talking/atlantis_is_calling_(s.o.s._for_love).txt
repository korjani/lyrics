Lady I know it will hurt
But it's much harder to ignore
There is a chance and I promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights we're romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere oh babe there is someone
Oh you're dancin' in my mind

Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool you need love
Like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love

Atlantis is calling S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling from the stars above
Atlantis is calling S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling it's too hot to stop

If lovin' you is wrong babe
Oh I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin babe
Oh baby hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I wait a million years for you
I love you more than I'm sayin'
Baby that's for me the truth
