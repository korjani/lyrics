If you break my heart
A heart that ever, babe, loves you
How can you mistreat?
They want your love
It's so true, I love you
Stay with me tonight
A heart will fall in love, that's right
Oh, I never can lose
I can never lose this old game
It's the same
Forever and ever again

Baby, save me - don't break me 
Be my forever, lady
Hold me - don't break me
Be tonight my love

Save me, please don't break me
Oh baby, never fool me
Save me, or you lose me
You'll never, babe, deceive me

You're the one I want
Oh you need love, like I do
You can hurt me more then I'll never babe feel brand new
That it's true
My heart belongs to you
And my heart cries just for you
Oh, I'll never can lose this old game
It's the same
Forever and ever again
