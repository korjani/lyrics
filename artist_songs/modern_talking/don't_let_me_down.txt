Oh please, believe baby, oh it's just a sad sad memory 
Oh please, believe baby, oh I swear that I'm not blind to see 
Oh you broke my heart, and I mean what I say 
I tell you, I swear you, I love you 
Oh don't tear apart, baby please stay 
I tell you, I'll swear you 
Baby I love you it's true 

Oh baby don't let me down 
Oh baby don't fool around 
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot 
Take me oh take me tonight 

Oh please, believe baby, we're closer to heaven, it's true 
Oh please, believe baby, there's no me oh babe without you 
I'm calling your name, and I mean what I say 
I tell you, I swear you, I love you 
My love is a flame, oh show me the way 
I tell you, I'll swear you 
Baby I love you, it's true 

Oh baby don't let me down 
Oh baby don't fool around 
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot 
Take me oh take me tonight 
Oh baby don't let me down 
Oh baby don't fool around 
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot 
Take me oh take me tonight 

Don't play a game with me-That's unfair, you'll see 
Oh don't be so scared-Baby please dare 
Don't be so scared of my love
