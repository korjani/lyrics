Outside the gates of heaven
Oh, there lives a unicorn
I close my eyes to seven
Oh, this world is not my home
A broken heart in danger
And a pillow filled with tears
Oh, can you see the strangers?
In the pain and in the fears
Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel the love tonight?

In 100 years
Love is illegal
In 100 years from now
In 100 years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In 100 years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating

You're looking through a fire
Computers everywhere
Oh, you're a shotgun rider
Controllers here and there
And you read old loveletters
Drawning in the sea
Oh baby it doesn't matter
Oh you've lost all what you feel
Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel the love tonight?

In 100 years
Love is illegal
In 100 years from now
In 100 years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In 100 years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Hear my heart is beating
