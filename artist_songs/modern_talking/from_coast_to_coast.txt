Oh lady, I'm close to lose you
You're burning up my life, more and more
Oh lady, I can't forget you
I know I can't survive, like before
Oh lady, I'll always miss you
Oh I will swear to you that I love you 

From coast to coast (from coast to coast)
From east to west (from east to west)
I know for sure (I know for sure)
You are the best (you are the best)
Why does it feel so good with you
Don't leave me here, what can I do?
My world is in your hands, you'll see
I love you till eternity 

Oh lady, if this is heaven
I'm not afraid of hell, I'm telling you
Oh lady, my heart is lonely
I know the time will tell, I tell the truth
Oh lady, I'll always miss you
Oh I will swear to you, that I love you

From coast to coast (from coast to coast)
From east to west (from east to west)
I know for sure (I know for sure)
You are the best (you are the best)
Why does it feel so good with you
Don't leave me here, what can I do?
My world is in your hands, you'll see
I love you till eternity
