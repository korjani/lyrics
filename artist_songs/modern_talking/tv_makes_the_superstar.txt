You'll take your chance, to be the one
And anything a possible, if you are strong, oh yeah
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
But you feel it in you heart, you can't go wrong
You are so nervous, just every single day
Here a voice from heaven, you'll find your way, oh

TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar wherever you are, oh yeah
TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar, sometimes it's so hard

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say Yeah!
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it
Let it all disappear

Don't be so sad, you're not the one
There's another chance for you, keep holing on, oh yeah
Just take your time and you will see
You can win it if you want, oh just like me
You need something to live for, every single day
I'll keep my fingers crossed, you'll find your way, oh yeah

TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar wherever you are, oh yeah
TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar, sometimes it's so hard

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting again!

One - Two - Three - Four - TV makes it, TV even breaks it - oh

TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar where ever you are, oh yeah
TV makes it, TV even breaks it
TV makes the superstar, sometimes it's so hard

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say Yeah!
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it
Let it all disappear

TV makes it, TV even breaks it
