Oh I tell you once and I tell you twice 
I'll be there for you in your paradise 
Oh please stay with me and I 
show you what I feel 
You're the nearest thing to heaven girl 
Baby just for you, I'll fly around the world 
Oh everything I'll do, I do it just for you 

My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other 
Tell me there's no other, deep in your heart 
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover 
There's no other, who's breaking apart 
Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other 
I'll feel alone, when I'm coming home 
Oh my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other 
cuz when I'm down, I need you all around 

I am not a man, who wants to be alone 
There's a place for us, we can't go wrong 
Oh baby you an I, we're flying one mile high 
We are more than two, you are more than one 
And my love for you is burning like the sun 
Oh everything I'll do, I do it just for you
