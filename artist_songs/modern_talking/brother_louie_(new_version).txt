Check it out, check it out
Here we go - let me say it
Tax on wax make the DJs wanna play it
The front to the front
And the back to the back
The hip to the hop
And the rhyme to the rap
Every single line on the time you admire
Stays in your brain like earth, wind and fire
Here I am all the time, girl, you know me
I must admit, I'm the real Brother Louie!

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart 
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Let me kiss your lips, I'm intrigued by the taste
The way you dance, the way you move your waist
We meet face to face in the crowded place
Let me take you home, let's cut the chase
To every man that's two-size - what do you choose?
If you choose my love, that means you never lose
Never have the chance to be there for you
Listen to the words of Brother Louie!

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart 
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Everybody in the house, c'mmon!

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie

You'll say!

Oh, she's only looking to me

Come on!

Oh, let it Louie

You'll say!

She is undercover

Come on!
