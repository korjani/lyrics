Drink up baby
Stay up all night
The things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be 
That you'll never see
The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
They push, shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby
Look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there 
With your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time 
And I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest
Where I like you the best
And keeping the things you forgot

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
