Swan dive down eleven stories high
Hold your breath until you see the light
You can sink to the bottom of the sea
Just don't go without me

Go get lost where no one can be found
Drink so long and deep until you drown
Say your goodbyes but darlin' if you please,
Don't go without me.

C'est la vie, C'est la mort.
(Such is life, such is death.)
You and me,
Forevermore.

Let's walk down the road that has no end
Steal away where only angels tread
Heaven or hell or somewhere in between
Cross your heart to take me when you leave
Don't go
Please don't go
Don't go without me
