On the first and the first fight
I'm only here to love you, only for one more night, boy
You wanna love me and let me go
I'm only here for the night, only for a one night, boy

Oh, here we go under these stars
But you're holding me back, holding me back, holding me back
You're holding me back, holding me back, holding me back

I am the tiger, welcome to my jungle
You're just a cheater, why you trying keep me chains on?
I fly the sky
I fly the sky
Why you trying keep me chains on?

They told me they can't score, just land in land
So, just I walked away, baby
Walked away, baby
Walked away and found you

Oh, no, here we are under the stars
Welcome to my jungle, baby
To my jungle, baby
Oh, no, you let me go
Now let me go
Oh, let me go
I am a tiger, I know you're a cheater
You are, you are, you are
