It's okay my love
If you cry a little sometimes it rains my love
You just gotta make it through the dark and see the sun
Still chained up to the shadows that you're running from
But it's okay my love

When you can't take no more
And you can't even remember what you're fighting for
People fill up off the greed and they still wanting more
Yeah we take another shot until we hit the floor

All I really want is those days when we got trust
Break down the hate and build up the love
I'm…serious, serious, I'm serious
I know that you're just looking for a way to get home
You might get lost but you're not alone
I'm serious...serious, I'm serious

I don't stress my life
I've been walking on a tightrope my whole life
This shit kills me but I stay alive
Do what I gotta do to stay alive

People like you and I
We believe they'll come a time
When we don't need to choose a side
Yeah we can feel alright, we can feel alright

All I really want is those days when we got trust
Break down the hate and build up the love
I'm…serious, serious, I'm serious
I know that you're just looking for a way to get home
You might get lost but you're not alone
I'm serious...serious, I'm serious
