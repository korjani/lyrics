What is love without the passion
The greatest love of all
Has been my freedom
Usually I'm kinda wild
But when I'm next to you
I'm like a child

No, no, here we go
Here we go
And there is one thing you gotta know
In words low, low

All I need, need is you to love me
Love me for who I am
Please, please, please don't judge me
And just be my lover boy just be my friend
Give me the realness no need to pretend
I've made mistakes and I'll do them again
But if you love me you'll love who I am
You'll love who I am
You'll love who I am
Love who I am

I know we just met each other
But there's so much about you
I must discover
Who are you and where'd you come from
My land is far away where the nature is my mother

There is a place that we could go
We could go
But there is one thing you gotta know
In words low, low

All I need, need is you to love me
Love me for who I am
Please, please, please don't judge me
And just be my lover boy just be my friend
Give me the realness no need to pretend
I've made mistakes and I'll do them again
But if you love me you'll love who I am
You'll love who I am
You'll love who I am
Love who I am

"I came here to make music
I love meeting creative people you know
You have to be an open mind you know?
But it's about collaborating with the right people who can help you, you know. We met for a reason"

"I said you're not just an ordinary person, but you're a god in this world"
