I, I feel like I'm losing my mind, mind
She crept into your life, life
And cut me up like a knife, knife, yeah
Hey hey, few things that I wanna say, ay
Still got my dignity, ay
No one'll love you like me, e

She's prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can love you good, but I can love you better
(but I can love you better)
She can love you good, but I can love you...

My way, remember screaming my name, ame
'Cause I can s-x your brain, ain
But she don't do it that way, ay, no...

She's prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can love you good, but I can love you better
(but I can love you better)
She can love you good, but I can love you better

I know she's perfect and worth it,
I but she's beautiful
But can she love you and touch you until you go
You keep on tryin' to hide it
But we both know, ow

She can love you good, but I can love you better

[Dubstep break]

She can love you good, but I can love you better
(but I can love you better)
She can love you good, but I can love you better

I know she's perfect and worth it,
I but she's beautiful
But can she love you and touch you until you go
You keep on tryin' to hide it
But we both know, ow

She can love you good, but I can love you better
Better, better, better, better
(but I can love you better)
Better, better, better, better
She can love you good, but I can love you better

I can love you better, baby!
