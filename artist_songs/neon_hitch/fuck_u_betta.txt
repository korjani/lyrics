I, I feel like I'm losing my mind, mind
She crept into your life, life
And cut me up like a knife, knife, yeah
Hey hey, few things that I wanna say, ay
Still got my dignity, ay
No one'll love you like me, ay

She's prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
I can fuck you betta 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
She can fuck you good, but I can  fuck you

My way, remember screaming my name, ame
'Cause I can sex your brain, ain
But she don't do it that way, ay, no

'Cause she's  prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can fuck you good, but I can  fuck you betta
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
I can fuck you betta 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you better

I know she's perfect and worth it,
I bet she's beautiful
But can she love you and touch you until you go oh 
You keep on tryin' to hide it
But we both know, oh

She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta

[Dubstep break]

She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
I can fuck you betta 
Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta Etta ay 
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta

I know she's perfect and worth it,
I bet she's beautiful
But can she love you and touch you until you go oh
You keep on tryin' to hide it
But we both know, oh

She can fuck you good, but I can  fuck you betta
Betta, betta, betta, betta
But I can fuck you betta
Betta, betta, betta, betta
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta

I can fuck you betta, baby!
