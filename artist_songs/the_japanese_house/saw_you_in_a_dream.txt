I saw you in a dream
You had stayed the same
You were beckoning me
Said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed
I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

Haven't talked to you in months
And I thought that I might cry
But I'm not that kind of guy

I saw you in a dream
You came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination

All good things come to an end
But I thought that this might last
But you came alive so fast

And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)

I saw you in a dream
Then it came tonight
I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
You take your time to reappear
I'm starting to believe that when I call your name

You just don't hear me anymore
And I know that I shouldn't even try
It's a waste of time

And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)

And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
It isn't the same but it is enough
