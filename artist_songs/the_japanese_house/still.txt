It's gone too far to ever go back
You know I wouldn't give you up but baby I don't want that
It hits you so hard to be so good
You know you keep so still and maybe it's a kind of flag
Maybe it's the reason that I'm back
Maybe it's alright
Maybe I've always been this kind
Baby it's too hard, and too scarred, for this to work again
But you know I still wake up with you every morning like we're still dead

I heard she's running love again
I know you're over that
I know that look you didn't want
You're all I've got
I heard you're fired up again
I know something doesn't feel right
You know it's gotta feel right

Things are all the same now
Then for a while this feeling hasn't changed
It eats me so hard to feel so great
You know you kept so clean, I was the reason that you didn't stay
Maybe it's the reason you're so glazed
Maybe it's alright
Maybe I've always been so afraid
Baby it's too hard and too scarred for this to work again
But you know I still wake up with you every morning like we're still dead

I heard she's running love again
I know get over that
I know that look you didn't want
You're all I've got
I heard you fucked it up again
I know something doesn't feel right
You know it's gotta feel right

I heard she's running love again (you kept still)
I know you're over that (still)
I know that look you didn't want, you're all I've got (you kept still / you kept so still)
I heard you fucked it up again (you kept still / still)

I know something doesn't feel right
You know it's gotta feel right
