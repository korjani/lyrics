Hold me up high for a while
You always said I'd learn to cry, and you were right
And I wept through your hold of the night

When you gave me something
Then it feels like summer
I keep on runnin' back

Sit back and open wide
Let me see you're dead inside
It's so hard to swim against the tide

I'm back trippin' over cracks in the road
Won't you slow me down?

Spirit grows when love goes away
And I'm still thinking of a new way to say
"I miss you"

It wasn't so hard to get
You're a figure in the dark, a silhouette
And you crept through the hole in my head

You were the feet of the sun, and it seems so funny
You keep on comin' back

Hold tight and clench your fists
'Cause your eyes aren't filled with phantom kiss
And just pray to your god that you missed

Rise up, floating over loves
That you've left

Spirit grows when love goes away
And I'm still thinking of a new way to say
That I'm missing you
