Back down to the water front
Sunlit hue to keep my body warm
I guess you love this man, I couldn't tell
It's the cold wet hand against my mother's spell

Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin

Slip into the water front
With your heart in your bag and your shoes taken off
I was so unsure you ever had the gall
Don't you understand I didn't need it at all

Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin
Current come pull me down
I won't take a breath, I wanna drown

And I call on the water to clean
The remains of the dirt that it leaves
To be brave and alert and pristine
There's a stain in the heart of me

Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin
Current come pull me down
I won't take a breath, I wanna drown
