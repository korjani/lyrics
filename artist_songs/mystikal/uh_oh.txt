[Intro]
Damn
Nasty
Spit on the ground nasty
Touch ya own ass nasty

[Chorus]
Up and down and sideways
Kitchen table staircase
Reverse and let me put it on ya 
Doing all positions sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
He got me sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
In the shower or the bedroom
The closet yea we'll make room
From the back can make it clap 
Do me in all positions
Sayin Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
He got me sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)

[Verse 1]
Damn look at that fit in them pants
Why ya gotta walk so nasty
Ooh I can tell ya been bad
Come here let me spank that ass 
You ain't gotta get on no bed
Or lay out no spread 
To give me some head
Shit we can start I the car 
Open the door I'ma stand on one leg
Let ya know that I am not playin
Wit a stroke that is not jokin
Tell her bend it over
Then I watched her bust it open
She wanted that platinum wrapper
So that rapper better have it
Turn around take that ass from the back
Shoulda heard that blacka blacka
Nigga I'm talkin bout tongue kissin
Tittie lickin and ass smackin 
Up in this bitch straight smashin
Then I heard her say damn you packin
Fuckin right I put it on her
Then went back to my neutral corner
Round over
Sound of the bell
Tell me just how you want it

[Chorus]
Up and down and sideways
Kitchen table staircase
Reverse and let me put it on ya 
Doing all positions sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
He got me sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
In the shower or the bedroom
The closet yea we'll make room
From the back can make it clap 
Do me in all positions
Sayin Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
He got me sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)

[Verse 2]
Nigga wit a bitch like that

She let me do the centipede

And I been her boo
I let her climb on that dick
And do the electric boogaloo

Everytime we hit the head
And everytime I make her come 
I make her ass do the harlem shake
She want that good ol big ol
She don't want that inni mini
She want that stanky leg
And do nothing with the beenie weenie
And I ain't gotta sugar coat it 
When I want my dick sucked
I tell her climb on that dick
She ride it like a go kart 
Ride it like a big truck
Do I wanna see her leave 
Or let her go
Fuck no

Up and down and sideways
Kitchen table staircase
Reverse and let me put it on ya 
Doing all positions sayin

In the shower or the bedroom
The closet yea we'll make room
From the back can make it clap 
Do me in all positions
Sayin Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)
He got me sayin 
Uh oh (Uh ohhhh)

Up and down and sideways
Kitchen table staircase
Reverse and let me put it on ya
