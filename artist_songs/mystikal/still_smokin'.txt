Still Smokin Bud, Still Smokin Weed 
King Edward, Philly Blunt, Swisha, keep groovin, Tampa Sweet, good ol
Optimo, easy water, joker

My lips get black and my fingertips burn and my eyes half way open
Cough Cough and I'm chokin
But bitch I'm Still Smokin!
I wanna be puffin this like I ain't be worryin bout nothin
If you gonna get the cigar
Nigga I'll do the stuffin
I roll em swoll like broken arms
But I sure hate when they come around this bitch I don't know talkin bout
What chall smokin on cause
Niggas like that we call em Hoovers
They try to get cool with ya
To smoke your weed up
Is what they do ya
Puff Puff Puff Puff Godammit!
Nigga you ain't chip in no shit here
Bitch What's Happenin!
But if you did then its good and it goin down
Get rid of them nickels and them dimes
Bitch we throwin pounds!
Tenth thru 11th to the 12th ward bound
But P said one of my niggas I heard somebody say
One Time!
But I paid it no mind and I kept rollin
But that was the Po Pos
I gotta get rid of this fat ass Optimo that I'm holdin
Excellerate and I made that left on line center
I hit that bitch one more time
Then threw it out the window
Young niggas in a big white truck
You know whats up
They're lookin to catch you fuckin up
It just so happened that I was hot
They looked in the back on the floor
And the silver canon and they found the pot
I can't believe that I got popped
It took me 2 hours and 1500 dollars
To get unlocked
Straight from jail to the weed spot
Shit I took that as a minor setback
Hell no I ain't stop!
And I'm
Still smokin bud
