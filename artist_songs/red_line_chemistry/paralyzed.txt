How long did you intend to carry the flame?
Just a little pretentious, don't you think?
No conversation, so I guess we'll take it on our own

So you keep your arrogant lies
While we're breaking barriers down
Call us brothers divided
You know it's wrong

You love to say that we just threw it away
You took the high road when you walked away
We'll live to fight another day in the game
Whatever comes our way
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed

So quick and senseless, the conclusions you made
Just a little misguided, don't you think
It's such a shame to end the story 'cause you jumped the gun

So you keep your arrogant lies
While we're breaking barriers down
Call us brothers divided
You know it's wrong

You love to say that we just threw it away
You took the high road when you walked away
We'll live to fight another day in the game
Whatever comes our way
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed

You love to say that we just threw it away
You took the high road when you walked away
We'll live to fight another day in the game
Whatever comes our way
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed
We're not paralyzed
