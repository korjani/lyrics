Louis, Louis play us a song
Louis, Louis the stage is aching for one
Please come back to the quiet generation
We don't have any representation.

Louis, Louis our stars no longer dance
Louis, Louis come down through the heavens
The sky is full of innuendos
We don't want any heroes

Louis, Louis all we want is music
Louis, Louis you play it without melancholy

Please play a song for everyone
Play it like it was the only one
So it will travel through the valleys
Into the roses and the berries
Louis, Louis

Louis, Louis they shot all the poets
Louis, Louis the world is not like you know it
There's no one with the right agenda
That's why we stay down here and won't surrender

Louis, Louis when only music is the answer
Louis, Louis every living being is a dancer

Please play a song for everyone
Play it like it was the only one
So it will travel through the valleys
Into the roses and the berries
Louis, Louis

Play us a song!
