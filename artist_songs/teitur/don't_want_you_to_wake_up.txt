Don't want you to wake up
Stay under the stars
Where none can make us
Change what we are

Dreamers in the dark
Following our hearts

Try to be silent
My eyes are too loud
I sit back in my hiding
While you're in the clouds
One kiss away from what I have to say

Don't want you to wake up
Stay under the stars
Where no one can make us
Change what we are
Don't want you to wake up

Its almost the morning
One foot out the door
As I let the light in
To love you even more
May our minds lose the battle
And may our hearts win the war

Don't want you to wake up
Stay under the stars
Where none can make us
Change what we are

Don't want you to wake up
