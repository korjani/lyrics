Here comes the wise man
And there goes the fool
You see that burnt out world that he is living in 
I don't need to look for the rules

Here comes the donkey
Chained to a ten ton plough
He'll never make that hill in a million years
Whip crack beating down

He loves his brother
But he'd sell him for a fistful of gold
He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land
No, I don't believe a word

Take me any way the wind blows

You'll never know just what you want to do 
Or where you wanna go, I think it's time 
That you found what the world is waiting for 
I think it's time to get real

Here comes the wise man
And there goes the fool
You see that burnt out world that he is living in 
I don't need to look for the rules

He loves his brother
But he'd sell him for a fistful of gold
He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land
No, I don't believe a word

Take me any way the wind blows

You'll never know just what you want to do 
Or where you wanna go, I think it's time 
That you found what the world is waiting for 
I think it's time to get real

Anytime you want it then it's there
All you gotta do is stop it on the corner and ask 
Say, hey, you don't live today, stop the world
Stop the world, I'm getting off
I'm getting off
Can't get enough
I'm getting off
