Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen
A million miles from here where no one's ever been
God-given grace and a holy Heaven face
I'm on the edge of something shattering
I'm coming through

"Ok, let's fly", she says, "this carpet's made for two"
This ugly little box, no place for me and you
Our carpet falls on a dew-fresh daffil plain
Take a look around, there's something happening
All the colors fade

I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
Oo, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
Oo, bang-bang, pretty-pretty, bang-bang
I don't think so, no, no
I don't think so, no, no
Bang-bang, bang-bang

Below, the country rolls like a mighty boiling sea
The warm, red Sun gives up and sinks into the trees
But I'm no fool, I can't stand here betrayed
Take a look around, there's something happening
All the colors fade

I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
Oo, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
Oo, bang-bang, pretty-pretty, bang-bang
I don't think so, no, no
I don't think so, no, no
Bang-bang, bang-bang
