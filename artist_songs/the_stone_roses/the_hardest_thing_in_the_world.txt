The hardest thing in the world

Holland fades, it don't please
I never wanted to leave
Searching for a perfect day
It never happens that way, a hey, hey, hey

I'm sick and tired and so obscene
Will Heaven help me be clean?
Searching for a perfect day (a perfect day)
It never happens that way, a hey, hey, hey

Cut away
I know your world wants you around

You never heard a word I said (a word I said)
It seems simple to me
That if you knew you wouldn't say (you wouldn't say)
It never happens that way, a hey, hey, hey

And the impression I get as the story unfurls
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world

Cut away
I know your world wants you around

What you feel it might not be
It seems suffer to me
I cannot climb to touch your spire
I'm getting higher and higher

Cut away
I know your world wants you around

The hardest thing in the world
