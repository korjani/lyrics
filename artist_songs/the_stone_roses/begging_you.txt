The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it
Saw the dust that he made

King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow
Hot the horn good to go, wait-oh his sting's all gone
Now he's begging you, begging you

Here is a warning, the sky will divide
Since I took of the lid now there's nowhere to hide
Now I'm begging you, begging you

This is a mystery not to be solved,
But be minded, like minded, I'm gone, still I'm with you,
I'm begging you, begging you

Give it over, give it over
Give it over, give it over
Yeah I'm begging you, I'm begging you
Give it over, give it over
Give it over, give it over
Yeah I'm begging you, I'm begging you

Weigh it and say it, is it all in a name
Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane
Can it make you remember, time is a place
Now I'm begging you, begging you

The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it
Saw the dust that he made

Make all the dust that you can
Make all the dust that you can

King bee in a frenzy ready to blow
