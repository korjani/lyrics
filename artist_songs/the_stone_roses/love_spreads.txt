Love spreads her arms, waits there for the nails
I forgive you boy, I will prevail
Too much to take, some cross to bear
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic, she's over there
Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again

[Chorus:]
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The messiah is my sister
Ain't no king man she's my queen
[x2]

I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, say she's alright
Yeah she's my sister

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again
Oh Oh

[repeat the chorus seven times]

I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, says she's alright 
Yeah she's my sister!
