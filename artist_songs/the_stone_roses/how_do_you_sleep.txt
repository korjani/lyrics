I've seen your severed head at a banquet for the dead
All dressed up for dinner looked so fine
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered
With the finest military quick lime 
Now try and picture this as I gave you a kiss
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade
We laughed as we put away your wine 

So raise your glasses here's a toast to wasted lives
May all their ghosts come back to haunt you
And tell you how they died 

How do you sleep?
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay?
How do you feel when you close your eyes and try and drift away?
Does it feel any better now?
Does it mean anymore when the angel of death
Comes knock-knocking and banging at your door? 

When all the fun was over
I put you on my shoulder
Took you home away from it all
Shot down and claimed
Mounted and framed
Tastefully hung upon my wall 

Are my dreams your nightmares?
I hope they all come true
Get off your knees
The party's over
I'm coming home to you 

How do you sleep?
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay?
How do you feel when you close your eyes and try and drift away?
Does it feel any better now?
Does it mean anymore when the angel of death
Comes knock-knocking and banging at your door?
At your door?
