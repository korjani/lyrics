Don't count your chickens, 'cause they're never gonna hatch
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack
'Cause you're too dumb, baby
You can't see the wood for the trees
'Cause you're too slow, baby
You just couldn't get off your knees

Don't count your chickens, 'cause they're never gonna hatch
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack
'Cause you're too dumb, baby
You can't see the wood for the trees
'Cause you're too slow, baby
You just couldn't get off your knees

I can see the love and the hate in your eyes
Penny for the thoughts behind the disguise
What you gonna do, and what you gonna say?
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way

It doesn't pay to disorientate me
It doesn't cost to be someone
I am the vine
And you are the branches

Don't knock a young man, you don't know what he'll get done
You can't kick an old man, see what he's become
You're far too lazy
You stick to your pillow with ease
'Cause you're much too lazy
You just couldn't get off your knees

I can see the love and the hate in your eyes
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do, and what you gonna say?
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way

It doesn't pay to disorientate me
It doesn't cost to be someone
I am the vine
And you are the branches

Don't count your chickens 'cause they're never gonna hatch
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack
'Cause you're too dumb, baby
You can't see the wood for the trees
'Cause you're too slow, baby
You just couldn't get off your knees

I can see the love and the hate in your eyes
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do, and what you gonna say?
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way

What you gonna do with the rest of your life?
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do with the rest of your life?
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do with the rest of your life?
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do with the rest of your life?
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise

I am the vine
And you're the branches
