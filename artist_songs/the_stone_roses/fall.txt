Pretending that the way's through the door
I wanna see you falling
A thousand reasons why I lose my hair
I'm not your darling, darling
I wanna see you falling

You tell me that your back's to the wall
I wanna see you falling
The saviour comes and the thief takes a walk
Take a walk
The feedback is on the wall
Your feedback don't taste good at all

You help yourself but it's at my expense
I wanna see you falling
And don't touch my fair love for no-one
I'm not your darling, darling
I wanna see you fall

[?]
I'm not your darling, darling
A thousand metres, they've all got his hair
We're not your darlings, darling
The saviour came and the thief took a walk
