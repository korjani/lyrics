Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
I'll tell you my story man, I wish I'd never been born
I'm loose at the seams, I've broken my dreams
And my hand, it shakes the pen
Come on, come on, now, baby, let the good times roll again, yeah

Where did our sweet love go, who stole away our time?
Why do the stars above refuse to shine?
The harder I try to paint a picture of the way it was back then
The more I miss the good times, baby, let it roll again

Good times, baby, this is the time
I need to know that your love is mine
Love me up yeah, you reel me in, I'm hooked, line and sinker
She's my heroin

How many days have I been lying on my back?
Staring at the ceiling, girl, stretching on your rack
The harder I try to paint a picture of the way it was back then
The more I miss the good times, baby, let it roll again

Good times, baby, this is the time
I need to know that your love is mine
love me up yeah, you reel me in, I'm hooked, line and sinker
She's my heroin

Said I'm hooked now, I'm not fakin', I'm here till the day I die
Can't get enough now, my heart is aching, I'm in to deep to stop
All I want is those, good times, baby, show me a sign
I need to know that your love is mine
Love me up yeah, yeah, reel me in, I'm hooked, line and sinker
She's my heroin
