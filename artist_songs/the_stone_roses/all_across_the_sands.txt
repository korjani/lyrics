Bones of an impressive romance
Scattered all across the sands
A secret safe with all the world
Too vain to seem so capable

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed 

How can a pretty painted shell
Send them all packing off to Hell
A freight train laughs and rattles by
You kissed the girls and made them die 

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed 

And I'll never come here again
And we will never come here again
And we will never play here again
Again 

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed 

After her call
After her call
After her call
And she calls
