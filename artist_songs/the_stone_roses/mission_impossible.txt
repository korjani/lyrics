(Impossible)

I'm not your sort, I thought I knew you once
You won't fool me, you can't fool me
You're really dim
You're sitting on cloud nine

Nauseating
You best come down
I'm not your sort
You though you knew me once
Well don't push me
You can't fool me
I seem so clear
You're sitting on cloud nine
Nauseating
You best come down

You're the one, you're the one
You wanna be that man

Impossible

But you're no-one, no-one and I'm yourself
I'll always be, I'll always be

You're the one, you're the one
Do you wanna be that
You're the one, you're the one
Can't wait to be that man

But you're no-one, no-one, you're no-one
No no no-one, no-one, no-one
No no no-one, no-one, no-one
No no no-one, no-one, no-one
