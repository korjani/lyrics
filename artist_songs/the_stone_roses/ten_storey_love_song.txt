When your heart is black and broken
And you need a helping hand
When you're so much in love
You don't know just how much you can stand

When your questions go unanswered
And the silence is killing you
Take my hand baby I'm your man 
I got loving enough for two

Ten story love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true

There's no sure-fire set solutions 
No shortcut through the trees 
No breaching the wall that they put there to keep you from me
As you're lying awake in this darkness
This everlasting night
Some day soon don't know where or when
You're gonna wake up and see the light

Ten story love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true

Ten story love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true
