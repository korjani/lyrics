Every mornin' I wake up, the first thing I remember,
Is all the things I said the night before.
Then I look in the mirror, stop myself pretendin'.
All I have is worth a whole lot more.

It doesn't matter what you do,
As long as I can be with you.
I know we're gonna see this through.
It's all about love.

Every time that I'm with you, I capture every moment,
Just in case this world should fall apart.
And I don't wanna lose you, you can hear me callin'.
I can't change what happened in the past.

It doesn't matter what you do,
As long as I can be with you.
I know we're gonna see this through.
It's all about love.

Look around, look around,
At all these familiar faces.
Don't ya' know, don't ya' know, don't ya' know,
That it still means the whole world to me?

So don't forget all the good times, the nights that we're together.
Keep those memories locked inside your heart.

It doesn't matter what you do,
As long as I can be with you.
I know we're gonna see this through.
It's all about love.

It doesn't matter what you say,
I'm never gonna walk away.
I'll love ya' 'til my dyin' day.
It's all about love.

It's all about love. [x7]
