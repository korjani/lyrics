I'm not the one to tell you what clothes to wear 
I'm not the one who talks about your hair 
I'm not the one to show you how I feel inside 
I'm not the one to say how much I care 

[Chorus]
Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit 
-cry just a little bit 
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit 
-cry just a little bit more 

I know it's late, I guess I should have called today 
I know you're tired of waiting by the phone 
I know you said-you just don't know how long you'll wait 
I know that you can live your life alone 

[Chorus]

In a world where there's no one to turn to
In a world where you think there's no one but you

But everytime you need someone to dry your eyes 
You call my name and know that I'll be there 

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
