You're taking this hard - and I still don't know 
If we've got a price - I'll let you go 
I don't wanna be just a part of your life 
I can't complain if I'm not sure 
I'll only remain if you're still pure 
I'm not gonna be just a part of your life 
You know I won't share you with another man 
So don't expect me to try and understand 
I don't wanna be just a part of your life 

[Chorus]
There's another choice 
There's another dream 
There's another place 
Another reason for living 
There's another face 
There's another mind 
There's another soul 
Another heart I could find 
I don't wanna be just a part of your life 

I don't wanna know what might be wrong 
Start looking for something that might be gone 
I'm not gonna be just a part of your life 
Making up for lost time won't ease the pain 
Or start looking for something - just to ease the strain 
I don't wanna be just a part of your life 

[Chorus] 

I don't want a friend just to turn to 
I don't need a hand that can only pull me through 
I'm not gonna be just a part of your life 
I don't wanna be just a part of your life
