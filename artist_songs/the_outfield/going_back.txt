I'm just a fool - no disguise 
I still get hurt - same old pride 
But growing older - I've realized 
There's not a place - in my life - tonight 

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna leave this town no more 
I'm sorry for the times that I did before 
I'm going back to where my heart came from 
I ain't gonna leave this town again 
I'm sorry for the things I did but then 
I didn't realize where I belonged 

Shakin' the blues - every night 
Been all alone - no surprise 
Don't you forget me - I'm so blind 
I'm coming back - one more time - tonight 

[Chorus]

If these streets were empty 
With nothing to see 
You could take me from this town 
Oh but you won't take this town out of me 

Too many years - can't forget 
So many dreams - ain't done yet 
An' all of these memories - still the same 
I'm going home - and I'll remain - unchanged

[Chorus]
