Think I might get lucky tonight 
Let my hair down get a little crazy, yeah 
My reflection's doing alright 
It don't take nothing to introduce suggestion 
Everbody's got one thing on their mind 
A set of wheels and a cranked up radio 
In this town there might be nowhere to hide 
In this town there might be nowhere to go but 

[Chorus]
On my left - to my right 
This is my paradise 
You can call it what you like - I know 
This is my paradise 

I might get lucky again 
I got a deal I know won't break me yeah 
If I can afford what money can't buy 
There's nothing better than a small town lady 
I'm no different to the boy next door 
A good time's the same for everyone 
I don't need another chance to be sure 
Since the day I was born I've always felt secure 'cos 

[Chorus]

Reputation's got a price of its own 
But not too many people want to pay for it 
Everybody needs a place to come from 
Everybody needs a place where they belong 

Everybody - this is my paradise 

[Chorus]
