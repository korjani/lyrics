I'm calling out but there's no one to hear me 
I'm so afraid cos there's nobody near me 
All that I've got are memories of Tuesday 
I can't remember anything she said 

Then in a moment my head starts spinning 
Around in a circle no end or beginning 
And just when I think that the whole world's turning 
I open my eyes and discover that life is just 
Burning down but this man stands his ground 
For when there's nothing left I'll fight for every breath 

[Chorus]
Don't turn your back on me baby - 
I'm taking all my chances 
Why can't you hear what I'm saying - 
I'm taking all my chances 

And when you're alone with nobody to turn to 
You look in the mirror and think that it's untrue 
In your reflection are you sure that you see 
The person that you've always wanted to be but 
You never were because you feared yourself 
And in your deepest thoughts, you looked for someone else 

[Chorus]

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus]
