Since you've been gone 
There's something I wanna say 
Since you've been gone 
There's no one taking your place 
Since you've been gone 
I've just been foolin' around 
Since you've been gone 
This world's been turned upside down 
Didn't think I'd find a girl that I could not forget 
Anything we started not so long ago - ain't over yet 

Since you've been gone 
Staring at your photograph 
And I know it won't be long 
An' I know you're coming back 

You turned me on 
Since the first time I set eyes on you 
You turned me on 
Ooh the things you want me to do 
Don't get me wrong 
'Cos you're not the only girl I've ever had 
But since you've been gone 
Girl you know the thought of you's driving me mad 
All I do is think of you I lie awake - lie awake 
And no matter how I try this loneliness - you know I can't take 

Since you've been gone 
Staring at your photograph 
And I know it won't be long 
An' I know you're coming back 

Since you've been gone 
There's something I wanna say 
Since you've been gone 
There's no one to stand in my way 
Since you've been gone 
So scared of losing this time 
Since you've been gone 
Girl you know that I can't get you out of my mind 

Since you've been gone 
Staring at your photograph 
And I know that I was wrong 
An' I know you're coming back 
Since you've been gone 
Tried my best to read between the lines 
If some things are hard to say 
You better tell me one more time 
Since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone
