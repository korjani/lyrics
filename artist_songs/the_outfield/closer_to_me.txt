One look - one touch - no chance 
I know what you're thinking 
Your move- you're mixed up - no choice 
Say you get the meaning 
And I'm not leaving here without you baby 
I like everything I've seen 

[Chorus]
Tonight we're just a little bit close 
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be yea' 
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer 
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me 

One day - one line - untied 
And we can talk it over 
She's hooked - she's mine - I say 
Stay a little longer 
An' I'm still waitin' on you baby 
An' I've got anything you need 

[Chorus]

Don't say - ya' too shy - hand jive 
Anyway you want it 
I'm here - all right - up tight 
Ain't no doubt about it 
And I'm not leaving here without you baby 
I like everything I've seen 

[Chorus]
