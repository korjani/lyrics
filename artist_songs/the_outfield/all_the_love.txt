I can't believe the things that happen to me 
I guess that I should have seen a long, long time ago 
Letters you write don't help me get through the night 
So I'll just turn out the light 
and sleep here all alone 

[Chorus]
All the love, all the love in the world 
All the love, I'll be sending you girl 
All the love 
All the love in the world 

Time after time I put my life on the line 
But I ain't committed no crime, so take what you can find 
Forget what I say cos I'll keep running away 
I only live for today, but I'm one day behind 

[Chorus]

These are the words that I whisper on every first night 
but that day you left me 
those words were on that same flight 

I can't believe the things that happen to me 
I guess that I should have seen a long, long time ago 
Letters you write don't help me get through the night 
so I'll just turn out the light 
and sleep here all alone 

[Chorus]
