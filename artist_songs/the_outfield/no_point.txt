This ain't working out 
(This ain't working)
It's not worth the time I spent on it 
When I've been next to you 
(This ain't working)
It's not the way you want it 
And all I wanna do 
Is get away and as far away from it 

There's no point 'cos I'm not winning 
There's no point going back to the beginning 
There's no point in hesitating 
There's no point to keep on waiting 
There's no point in talking it over 
There's no point in getting any closer 

If it was up to you 
(If it was up to)
We'd go around in circles forever 
There's nothing left to do 
(There's nothing left to)
I go around - around in you 
I've tried to see it through 
All I've seen is the stormy weather 

There's no point in still pretending 
There's no point 'cos this is never ending 
There's no point in keep on trying 
There's no point to carry on lying 
There's no point acting like children 
There's no point 'cos this time I'm gone 
I'm gone

There's no point in talking it over 
There's no point in getting any closer 

There's no point in still pretending 
There's no point 'cos this is never ending 
There's no point in keep on trying 
There's no point to carry on lying 
There's no point in talking it over 
There's no point in getting any closer 

There's no point 'cos I'm not winning 
There's no point going back to the beginning 
There's no point in hesitating 
There's no point tonight 
There's no point at all
