I'm closing up - I'm closing in 
Couldn't wait for this moment to come 
Couldn't wait for this day to begin 
Won't be afraid - got so much pride 
And I've never been a loser 
And I just can't lose tonight 

[Chorus]
Winning it all - ain't gonna walk away 
Giving it all - no matter what you say 
Ain't gonna fall - don't wanna lose today 
Winning it all 

This time it's right - my time has come 
Gonna give everything that I've got 
Till it's over and victory's won 
No second chance - no giving up 
Because no one remembers a loser 
And I don't intend to be one 

[Chorus]
