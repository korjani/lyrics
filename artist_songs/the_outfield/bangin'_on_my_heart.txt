I don't tell the truth 
I bet that's not a real surprise 
I said I'd be forgetting about you 
But now I know I'm wasting my time 
You won't set me free 
I guess I'll never get away 
I can't beat that feeling inside you 
You're bangin' on my heart again 

B-B-B-Bangin' 
Bangin' on my heart 
B-B-B-Bangin' 

Just another girl 
Is all I thought you were and then 
You went and proved me wrong 
Now I'm in trouble 
You're bangin' on my heart again 
Numbers all I took 
Figures still inside my head 
And now I'm not sure that it's all over 
I thought you were gone 
You're back in my heart again 
Heart again 
Back in my heart again 
Heart again 

You've known all along 
I jump whenever 
You're banin' on my heart again 
Ooh I've been into you 
More times than you've been into me 
But this scar's gonna last forever 
I know this feeling's something you'll never see 
I know this feeling's something you'll never see 
Bangin' on my heart again 
Bangin' on my heart again 

B-B-B-Bangin' 
Bangin' on my heart 
B-B-B-Bangin' 
Bangin' on my heart
