Staying up all night - this could be a party 
I've got some friends outside - looking for a good time 
You better head my way - this is where it's starting 
No rules - no laws - tonight you're gonna stay 

[Chorus]
Hey girl hold me tight - the night ain't over 
Hey girl hit that light- the night ain't over 

I'm staying up all night - this could a showdown 
I've got this thing inside - telling me don't run and hide 
And there's so many roads - only you can go down 
Don't close - your eyes - there just might be another way 

[Chorus]

Ooh I might be losing my soul 
But life's only fun when it's dangerous 
And I don't wanna be told 
I won't play safe and start growing old 

It's five in the morning 
And I can feel the beads of sweat 
Running down the back of my neck 
It's so good to be with you again 
Oo-oo-oo 

Someday - wait and see 
This will be just a memory 
And I'll look back with no regrets 
Good times like this I can't forget 

[Chorus]
