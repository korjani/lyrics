You’ve been to every spot in this town,
And there’s no other place you rather be!

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights, to show me,
Lit up like a star,
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me,
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!

So come on, dance!
You, you ride it, it’s a party,
So come on, dance!
After midnight, we’re excited!
So, come on!
Get your drinks down, spend your money,
Put your hands all over somebody!
So find the highest point,
And don’t you ever come on down
You're where everybody wants to be,
They all wanna go!

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights, to show me,
Lit up like a star,
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me,
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!

Feel the moment, everything it's worth,
You’re the last surviving star on Earth
So swell up the rhythm, feel the pulse beating inside of you,
So everyone in here feel free,
What do you have to lose?

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights, to show me,
Lit up like a star,
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me,
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!
There’s no other place you rather be!

Turn up the lights, to show me,
Lit up like a star,
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me,
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.

Turn up the lights, to show me,
Lit up like a star,
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me,
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world.
