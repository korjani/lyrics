Worshipping the serpent, raising the dead
The wizard's spell is ringing in my head

Once upon a time, and so very far away and prey
Sacrifice of blood, macabre human feast
Faces in the mud, slayed by the beast
Worshipping the dark, playing with the dead
Grinning like a shark, deamon in your head
The dead skall rise again, and walk upon the earth
Wizard's words ring true, death will bring rebirth
Eternal lies in the serpents eyes
Voodoo spirits walk alive
Macabra sights in the Voodoo Night
Wings of death'll hunt you down

Oh, you know too much, just a little touch
Of the forbidden knowledge

Casting Evil Spells we're children of the grave
The serpent's raising hell, turn masters into slaves
Sitting on his throne in temples of doom
His evil powers grown in eternal gloom
If you see the truth, the deamon is unveiled
Leave behind the fools and all of those who've failed
They will never learn, no matter how they try
Forever they will burn, already dead they cannot die

Eternal lies in the serpents eyes
Voodoo spirits walk alive
Macabra sights in the Voodoo Night
Wings of death'll hunt you down

Oh, you know too much, just a little touch
Of the forbidden knowledge, of the forbidden knowledge

Casting evil spells, we'ew children of the grave
Serpents in the depths of hell turn masters into slaves

Obeying all the rules
won't get you anywhere
Obeying is for fools
and fools are everywhere
They will never learn,
no matter how they try
Forever they will burn,
already dead they'll never die

Never fool yourself,
the magic is too strong
Praying for your life,
you're dead before too long
When it's said and done
the dead will walk the earth
When there's no more sun,
Life, it has no worth

Eternal lies in the serpents eyes
Voodoo spirits walk alive
Macabra sights in the Voodoo Night
Wings of death'll hunt you down

Ah...

If you see the truth, the deamon is unveiled
Leave behind the fools and all of those who've failed
Sitting on his throne in temples of doom
His evil powers grown in eternal gloom
Never fool yourself, the magic is too strong
Praying for your life, you're dead before too long
Yes indeed
