Gaze upon the sky
Solid clouds are killing your sight
The air is high, and the earth is deep
The sun is not dead
He's just asleep

Can't you see it's not a simple thing
Can't you see it's the birth of a king
Yet it's not over and done
It's the birth of the sun

Gaze upon the sky
Solid clouds are killing your sight
The air is high, and the earth is deep
The sun is not dead
He's just asleep

Now the sun is born
And the darkness has vanished
Now the Rising force
Rules the universe
And the stars

But you didn't find it
But you didn't find it
But you didn't find it
But you didn't find it

Come on, give me some guitar man!
