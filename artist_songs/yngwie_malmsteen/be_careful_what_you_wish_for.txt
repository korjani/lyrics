Your walking the tight rope
With no one to hold you when you fall
Hold on to what you got
Or you'll end up losing it all

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
listen to the whispers in your ear

Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
Your keep on pushing
But know your pushing too far
The demon will find you
No matter who you are

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
listen to the whispers in your ear

With friends just like this
I sure don't need any enemies
Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
listen to the whispers in your ear
Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
A cheat never wins and a winners
never cheat
Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
listen to the whispers in your ear
Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
