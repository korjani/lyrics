Well You're damned if you do 
You're damned if you don't 
Catch 22   
You're so Very close, Yet so far 
You gave your best shot 
Still no cigar 
Working your fingers down to the bone 
Running with sinners, your life's just on loan 
Catch 22   
They say you can 
They say that you can't 
Catch 22 
The Limits the sky 
But they lock you inside 
You're livin' a lie 
You'll never know why 
Workin' your fingers down to the bone 
Running with sinners, your life's just a loan 
Catch 22   
Catch 22   
You think you will win 
But you always lose 
Catch 22   
They think they're so strong 
They think they are so wise 
You know they are wrong 
They tread on thin ice 
Working your fingers down to the bone 
Running with sinners 
Your life is just a loan 
Catch 22   
Catch 22   
You think you will win, but you always lose 
Catch 22   
They think thet are so strong 
They think they are so wise 
You know they are wrong 
They tread on thin ice 
Workin' you fingers, down to the bone 
Running with Sinners, Your life is just a loan 
Catch 22
