Don't chain me down
I'll burn inside
I'm losing my mind
To see the light
I can't find the key
To unlock the door
I have to be free
I can't take anymore
In this dungeon
I am a prisoner
Free me from my shackles
I'm a caged animal
Don't lock me in
I can't breath in here
I have to escape
Away from here
I have to break out
From this prison cell
I have to flee
This glorified hell
In this dungeon
I am a prisoner
Free me from my shackles
I'm a caged animal
In this dungeon
I am a prisoner
Free me from my shackles
I'm a caged animal
