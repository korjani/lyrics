I'm ready for battle 
I'm ready for war 
Slaughtered like cattle 
You Sons of Babylon's Whore 
In a matter of time 
Titans will clash 
To put an end to your lies 
And the world turns to ash 
I must use The Force 
In the War to End All Wars 
War to End All Wars 
There is no castle 
I can't bring down 
You will die faster 
You fucking clown 
In our complication 
Someone must bend 
My justification will come in the End 
I must end this madness 
I must use The Force 
I must cure this sadness 
In the War to End All Wars 
I must use The Force 
In the War to End All Wars 
War to End All Wars 
War to End All Wars 
I must end this madness 
I must use The Force 
I must cure this sadness 
In the War to End All Wars 
I must use The Force 
In the War to End All Wars 
War to End All Wars 
War to End All Wars
