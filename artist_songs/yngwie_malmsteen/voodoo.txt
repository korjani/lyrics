The moon is bright in the voodoo night
Dead eyes are burning with fire
There's no more light in the voodoo night
What's wrong and what's right,
Let's end this fight

Something has started to grow
Something that died long ago
You know too much and you touch
Forbidden knowledge

Voodoo

Tryin' to hide in the voodoo night
Your cup of poison it feels so right
The moon is bright in the voodoo night
Dead eyes are burning with fire

Something has started to grow
Something that died long ago
You knew too much and you touch
Forbidden knowledge

Voodoo
