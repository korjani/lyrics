Well it seemed to me
That the place to be
Was far away
From the dark and the cold

So I sailed away
Into the sun
across the blue sea
Magic city is my home
Where I wanna be
Forever more

Well I had to go away
I just couldn't stay
Where the cold winds blow
And I'm surrounded by ice and snow
So I sailed away
Into the sun
Across the blue sea

Magic city is my home
Where I wanna be
Forever more
Magic city is my home
Where I wanna be
Forever more
