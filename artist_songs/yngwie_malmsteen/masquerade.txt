You never show yourself 
You're living in disguise 
You keep on runnin' 
And you'll run until you die 
Someday you'll realize 
You made a great mistake 
The devil in your eyes 
You're just a big fat fake 
Break down the falls 
Drop the false facade 
Always in Disguise 
In the mask you made 
Tryin' to hide your eyes 
In the Masquerade 
Why? 
You can't be running around 
Hiding behind your mask 
You can't be shooting straight 
Is that too much to ask 
You played me for a fool 
But thefool was always you 
You tried to be so cool 
But it was never true 
Break down the falls 
Drop the false facade 
Always in Disguise 
In the mask you made 
Tryin' to hide your eyes 
In the Masquerade 
Break down the falls 
Drop the false facade 
Always in Disguise 
In the mask you made 
Tryin' to hide your eyes 
In the Masquerade 
Why?
