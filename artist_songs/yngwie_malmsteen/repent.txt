I've had enough
Enough of your empty lies
It's time for you to go now
Sayonara forever

You just can't win
This time around
You must repent your sins
The truth was lost
But now it's found (again)

You must repent your sins

Well, I'll see you later
Much, much later
It's time for you to go now
Sayonara forever
