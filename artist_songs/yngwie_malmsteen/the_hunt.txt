Now you look away.
Onto the horizon.
Kneel and pray.
You better pray for your life.
Piece by piece.
It all becomes clearer.
Now the chains are off.
And the demons are here.

See no evil.
Hear no evil.
Speak no evil.
Oh no.

The structure falls.
As the spell has been broken.
Now the hunt begins.
The tempest is near.
Now there is no doubt.
You will fall their prey.
There's no way out.
Your soul can't be saved.

See no evil.
Hear no evil.
Speak no evil.
Oh no.

It will all turn to ashes.
As they are burning it down.
It will all come to pass.
And they will be taking you down.
So now the hunters ride.
And soon they will be upon you.
The wall will rise again.
You better pray for your soul.

See no evil.
Hear no evil.
Speak no evil.
Oh no
