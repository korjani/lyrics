Ask yourself where you're hearding for
Deviate - no need to conform

All it takes is some confidence
Seize the day, it might not come again

Only the strong will survive
Stand tall and never die
Come out from where you hide
No need you swallow your pride

Only the strong will survive
get up and reach for the sky
Don't wait for no-one and
Don't let your heart be denied

Face the truth and control your fate
Set the pace never hesitate

All that scares you and makes you doubt
Break the silence, just spit it out
