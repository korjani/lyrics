Now we’re on the journey
Back into darker times
Can you see the man made mountains
They were built for those divine
We walk into the twilight
In the land of the dead.

When the dogs walked the earth
In the city of a thousand gates
They were kings from birth
That was their given fate.

In the valley of kings
Where the echoes still ring
On the hot desert winds
In the valley of kings.

Their souls that are immortal
Within their after life
Their soaring through the portal
To be eternal light
They were ruling without mercy
Reigning life on earth.

When the gods walked the earth
In the city of a thousand gates
They were kings from birth
That was their given fate.

In the valley of kings
Where the echoes still ring
On the hot desert winds
In the valley of kings.

When the gods walked the earth
In the city of a thousand gates
They were kings from birth
That was their give fate.

In the valley of kings
Where the echoes still ring
On the hot desert winds
In the valley of kings.
