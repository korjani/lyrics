I'd rather live than just imagine
Don't think there is a way around
And if I fail I'll still be standing
With my feet firmly on the ground

Through my window from the sky
Flows a lullabye
Someone's waiting in my dream
Taking me to places I've never seen

If I had some wings then I could fly (Dragonfly)
In my dreams
I am the Dragonfly (Dragonfly)

I guess I always will be searching
I live and learn from my mistakes
And all the love that I've expecting
Is equal to the love I make

Little dreamer when evening falls. Shadows fall
Bring some honey for my soul
Take me to the places I've never been

If I had some wings then I could fly (Dragonfly)
In my dreams I am the Dragonfly (Dragonfly)
