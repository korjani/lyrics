Now the demon is here again
Vengeance is burning in my soul
I am a soldier
In the legion of forever
Ride on the storm
And never surrender
To death or glory
Keep on marching
On hallowed ground
Until death or be victorious
Death dealer is on the hunt
On the hunt
I can't believe that this is true
This demon really loves the pain
I am a soldier
In the legion of forever
Ride on the storm
And never surrender
To death or glory
Keep on marching
On hallowed ground
Until death or be victorious
Death dealer is on the hunt
On the hunt
He is the bringer of the pain
Jesus Christ
Not again
I am a soldier
In the legion of forever
Ride on the storm
And never surrender
To death or glory
Keep on marching
On hallowed ground
Until death or be victorious
Death dealer is on the hunt
On the hunt
