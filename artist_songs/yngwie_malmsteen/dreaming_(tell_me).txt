Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.

Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.

Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.

Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.

Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.
