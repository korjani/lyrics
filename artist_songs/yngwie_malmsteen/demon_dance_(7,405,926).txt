Welcome to the masquerade
The ultimate feast
The party that never fades
Darkness unleashed

As the earth is turning
There's no more romance
As the souls are burning
Deamons will dance

Seven million, four hundred
Five thousand, nine
Hundred and twenty-six
Deamons will do their dance
Cannot escape
Holding a crucifix

Deamons Dance

They've all been part of this
For thousands of years
Granting the wizards wish
Obey out of fear

Unholy Rites
Leave nothing to chance
In the dead of night
Do the deamons dance

Seven million, four hundred
Five thousand, nine
Hundred and twenty-six
Deamons will do their dance
Cannot escape
Holding a crucifix
Seven million, four hundred
Five thousand, nine
Hundred and twenty-six
Deamons will do their dance
Cannot escape
Holding a crucifix

Deamons Dance
Deamons Dance
No, no, no
Deamons Dance

Centuries ago
Unholy sacrifice
Rivers of blood die flow
Deamons arise

As the earth is turning
There's no more romance
As the souls are burning
Deamons will dance

Seven million, four hundred
Five thousand, nine
Hundred and twenty-six
Deamons will do their dance
Cannot escape
Holding a crucifix

Deamons Dance

No, no, no
Deamon Dance
Ah
