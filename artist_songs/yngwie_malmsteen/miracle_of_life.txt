I was old 
When I was born 
I was feeling cold 
And my soul was torn 
I walked alone 
In solitude and sorrow 
I've been shown 
I can see tomorrow 
Then I found you 
And we were one 
A new life found 
A new life found 
It's a miracle of life   
My life has been 
A journey full of hop 
And all I've seen  
Is the end of my rope 
We'll I have lost 
And I have won 
Counting the cost 
My Faith was never gone 
Then I found you 
And we were one 
A new life found 
A new life found 
It's a miracle of life   
I've made the sacrifice 
Lord knows I paid the price 
A Miracle of life 
I always had a dream 
But it's never what it seems 
A miracle of life   
So it is time 
We were meant to be 
Always with you 
Always with me 
Then I found you 
And we were one 
A new life found 
A new life found 
It's a miracle of life   
Then I found you 
And we were one 
A new life found 
A new life found 
It's a miracle of life
