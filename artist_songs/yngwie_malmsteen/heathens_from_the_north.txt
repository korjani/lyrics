Dress in armour
bring your sword and shield
and your lucky charm
In dragonships
we'll sail the seven seas
under guiding stars

Into battle - we will ride
Gods will follow - by our side

Heathens from the north
Heathens from the north

The air is still, the
bodies cold and pale
they'll never live to tell
About the slaughter
when battleground ran red
we gave them hell

Into battle - sense of pride
We're forever - shining bright

Heathens from the north
Heathens from the north

Heathens from the north
Heathens from the north
We are immortal
ever shining bright
Heathens from the north, yeah
