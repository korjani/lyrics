I don't know for sure 
But I've been told 
I have lived before 
And I'll live again 
In a distant land 
In the Spirit Realm 
Not as the Heathen in the North

Is there a crystal ball 
To enlighten me 
Anythin at all 
to make me see 
What the future holds 
What has been before 
Like the seer from the East 
Not as the Heathen from the North
