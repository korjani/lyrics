You mince your words, but
My sword speaks the truth
Now, you must know that
I am stronger than you
You always slip and slide
But you can't hide
I challenge you to the death
Let it be pistols at dawn
That suits me fine
Ain't no rush
So don't hold your breath
No heaven waits for you
Only your demise
It's time to face the truth
and you realize
Axe to the Grind
Axe to the Grind
I have an axe to grind with you
I really hate you, through and through
No matter what you do
Well I've got you now
Against the ropes
I'm going in for the kill
You are far beyond hope
No heaven waits for you
Only your demise
It's time to face the truth
and you realize
Axe to the Grind
Axe to the Grind
