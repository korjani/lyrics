Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.

Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Faster than the speed of light
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.

Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.

Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat

Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Faster than the speed of light
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.

Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Faster than the speed of light
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
