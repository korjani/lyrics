You're a hypocrite.
What you say and do are not the same.
Now you're to blame.
And you're paranoid.
To live will cost you.
But to die is free.
Oh yes, indeed.

You've got a head full of lead.
Yeah that's what I said.
You've got a head full of lead.
And now you're dead.

Cause I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.

It's not acceptable.
You have no excuse for what you did.
Now you must surrender.
And it's impossible.
You can't comprehend the greatest sin.
You must remember.

You've got a head full of lead.
Yeah that's what I said.
You've got a head full of lead.
And now you're dead.

'Cause I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
Fire!

Don't hold your breath.
Just throw the dice.
And will claim my prize.
Oh yes indeed.

You've got a head full of lead.
Yeah that's what I said.
You've got a head full of lead.
And now you're dead.

'Cause I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
I'm locked & loaded.
Fire!
