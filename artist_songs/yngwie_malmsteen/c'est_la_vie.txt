Fighting the odds while we still have time
There is a limit don't cross that line
It's no good with water we cannot drink
We're a ship about to sink

We pray but the walls is just too high
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky

C'est la vie life in the shadows
C'est la vie there's no tomorrow

Give us back the blue blue sky
Where the air is so fresh where eagles fly
What good is a planet that's slowly dying
What kind of life can it bring

We pray but the walls is just too high
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky

C'est la vie life in the shadows
C'est la vie there's no tomorrow
