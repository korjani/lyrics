We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.

Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.

You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.

Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.

I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.
