My resolution this year? I'll disappear completely.
My absolution nearer, I'll reappear discretely 

Calling underground people,
With your underground hearts;
You could start a mainstream fire
With your underground sparks.
Keeping all your underground thoughts
From the surface above,
Realize it is inside those minds
Where revolutions start.

Your only failure will be thinking you see right through me.
When things become much clearer, I'll know just where you have been.

On and on I feel you slide
Deep into my memory, slowly.
I look behind to find you stood in front of me, 
Adding to elements of subtraction.
Taken from that backwards heart,
And mistaken for love,
I search for ways to compensate for
Simple words no longer true to me.

My resolution this year? I'll disappear completely.
My absolution nearer, I'll reappear.
Your only failure will be thinking you see right through me.
When things become much clearer, I'll know just where you have been.

Suddenly I'm in a place I've never seen before.
In front of me a faceless figure that I've seen before;
Undeterred by motions of distraction, and it's coming to me.

Your life (undeterred my motions of distractions)
You're right (and it's coming to me)
You're alive (undeterred by motions of distraction)
But your mind wont think what it's supposed to.
