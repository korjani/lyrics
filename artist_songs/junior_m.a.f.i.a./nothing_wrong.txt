[Talkbox Parts]

[Intro/Talkbox]
It's the Mafia

[Lil Cease]
Uh, uh, say what, say what
It's the J-M-C in the motherfuckin' house y'all niggaz ain't (here we go), say what
Let's get it poppin' like the L popped the cris' (get it poppin')
Get my mind right so I can slide with a bitch (oohhh)
Cease spot her well I got the eye for the chick
Ass and tits fat with the juicy lips
Mami let me holla at you for a few ticks
Get to know your name while you light some spliffs
Let me get inside your mind for some major shit
Let me put you on to some old gangsta shit (gangsta shit)
I step up in the club so fresh and so clean clean (clean clean)
Maxout, and Mafia the american dream team (dream team)
Big free rollin' on dubs with the bling bling
When it comes to stuntin' for it shit ain't no thang thang
Niggaz ain't slackin' niggaz just packin'
Bet you don't want to see the G-U-N-C'S
Shit is off the hook, ma please believe it
Move +Dem Thangs+ Like +Angie Martinez+ (for my gangstas)

[Chorus/Talkbox]
Let's keep it rockin'
We got the cris', let's get it poppin'
We got haaaze, let's get the smokin', ??? on somethin'
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong (no I don't baby)
With smokin', bustin', fuckin' hoes all night long

[Banger]
Hey Mami
Peace to all my fly hunnies
To all my niggaz gettin' money
To all my real gangstas sittin' on 20's
Lace your pinky, your wrist your neck full of jewelery
Live your life to the fullest if you feel me, bitch
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
I put my dick in a hoe every single night (every single night)
What more can I say I can show you the best tell it
I +Get My Freak On+ way more than +Missy Elliot+
And if you think somethin' sweet
We do like uncle L and swing a F through your jeep
Ass like trina (take it to the house)
Freak like adina (take it in your mouth)
Cause if you ain't up on thangs
Bang bang be the name J-M-C's the gang
I rep M-A-X, O-U-T
Blaze hoes from N-Y, cali to south beach (to all my gangstas)

[Chorus/Talkbox x2]
Let's keep it rockin'
We got the cris', let's get it poppin'
We got haaaze, let's get the smokin', ??? on somethin'
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong (no I don't baby)
With smokin', bustin', fuckin' hoes all night long

[Cont. Talkbox]
It's the mafia, you know there ain't nothin' wrong
Baby you know there ain't nothin' wrong
You know there ain't nothin' wrong
I want to fuck you all night long, stop it baby
You know there ain't nothin' wrong
Baby you know there ain't nothin' wrong
Smoke a blunt, smoke a blunt
Ohh all night long, it's the mafia
Oooo let's keep it rockin', it's the mafia
It's the mafia, it's the mafia, it's the mafia
Oooooo it's the mafiaaaa
