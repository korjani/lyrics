You snake
You crawled
Between
My legs
Said "Want
It all?
It's yours 
You bet
I'll make 
You queen
Of everything
No need 
For God
No need 
For him
Just take 
My hand
You'll be 
My bride
Just take 
That fruit
Put it 
Inside"
You snake
You dog
You fake
You liar
I've burned 
my hands
I'm in 
the fire

Awooooooh....oooooooohhhh

You salty dog
You filthy liar
My heart 
It aches
I'm in 
The fire
You snake (You snake)
I ate (I ate)
A true (A true)
Belief (Belief)
Good Lord (Good Lord)
That fruit's (That's fruit's)
Inside (Inside)
Of me (Of me)
Oh Adam (Oh Ad-)
Please (-am please)
You must (You must)
Believe (Believe)
That snake (That snake)
Put it (Put it)
In front (In front)
Of me (Of me)
That snake
Put it
In front
Of me
