It starts at daylight
I see him
Before my sad eyes
I hear him breathing
Oh lover, need you to lead me
No never thought that you'd leave

That was my veil
That was my time
Once held secret
But now lies

No words can
Heal my heart
Inside I'm broken
Now it's done
Was she a pretty girl ?
Does she have pretty hair ?
Was she soft-spoken ?
Was there a love there ?

That was my veil
That was my time
Once held secret
But now lies

Give back my veil
Give back my time
No more secret
You give me lies

Give me back my veil
Give back my life
No more secret
You give me lies
Lies
