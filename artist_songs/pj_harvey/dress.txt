Put on that dress.
I'm going out dancing.
Starting off red,
Clean and sparkling
He'll see me.
Music play make it dreamy for dancing
Must be a way that I can dress to please him.
It's hard to walk in the dress
It's not easy
I'm spinning over like a heavy loaded fruit tree.

If you put it on,
If you put it on.
If you put it on,
If you put it on.

It's sad to see,
Lonely all this lonely.
Close up my eyes.
Dreamy, dreamy music make it be alright.
Music play make it good for romacing.
Must be a way I can dress to please him.
Swing it sway everything'll be alright
But it's feeling so damn tight tonight.

"You purdy thang, " my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"
"You purdy thang, " my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"

Filthy tight the dress is filthy
I'm falling flat and my arms are empty
Clear the way better get it out of this room
A fallen woman in dancing costume.
