My first name Angelene
Prettiest mess you've ever seen
Love for money is my sin
Any man calls I'll let him in

Rose is my colour and white
Pretty mouth, and green my eyes

I see men come and go
But there'll be one who will collect my soul
And come to me

Two thousand miles away
He walks upon the coast
Two thousand miles away
It lays open like a road

Dear God, life ain't kind
People gettin born then dying
But I've heard there's joy untold
Lays open like a road in front of me

Two thousand miles away
He walks upon the coast
Two thousand miles away 
Lays open like a road

It seems so far away
I see men come and go 
Two thousand miles until I reach that open road

My first name's angelene
