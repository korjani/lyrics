Horses in my dreams 
Like waves, like the sea 
They pull out of here 
They pull, they are free

Rode a horse around the world 
Along the tracks of a train 
Broke the record, found the gold 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear

Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea 
On the tracks of a train 
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear
