Love me tenderly my darling
In the city of light and truth
For this moment forever sing
For my darling that I love you

The City

Of no sun
( of no sun )
No peace
( and no peace )
In my heart
( no joy in my heart )
You left me

Nothing
( make me nothing )
You left me
( broken )
Broken
You love sell
( It's funny )
You love scream
( you said you loved me )
You love seal
( you love me )
You love me
( you love me )
You love me

Outside the fields
In sunlight
The singing breeze
And the silence

Lover

( release me )
Release me
( I can't move )
I can't move
( I can't breathe )
I can't breathe
I can't grieve
( I can't hear nothing )
And no heart
( no heart )
No peace
( no peace )
No more nothing
( nothing )
A long day
( a long day )
A long night
