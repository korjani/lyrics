Hey I'm one big queen
No one can stop me
Red light red green
Sat back and watching
I'm your new one 
Second to no one
No sweat I'm clean 
Nothing can touch me

Tell you my name 
F U and C K
50ft queenie 
Force ten hurricane
Biggest woman 
I could have ten sons
Ten gods ten queens
Ten foot and rising

Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on and measure me
I'm twenty inches long

Glory, glory 
Lay it all on me
50ft queenie 
50 and rising
You bend over 
Casanova
No sweat I'm clean
Nothing can touch me

Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on and measure me
I'm twenty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on and measure me
I'm thirty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on and measure me
I'm forty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on and measure me
I'm fifty inches long
