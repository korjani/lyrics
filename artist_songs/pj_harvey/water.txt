water
walking on
water   
for years
taking it into my head
living by the right lines
reading what the very man said

water
walking on
water		
neighing on eleven years
taking it into my head
mary mary drop me softly
i've been reading what your very man said
neighing on eleven years
taking it into my head
leave my clothes on the beach
i'm walking down into the sea
prove it to me
now the water to my ankles
now the water to my knees
think of him all waxy wings
melted down into the sea
mary mary what your man said
is washing in all over my head
mary mary hold on tightly
over water under the sea
