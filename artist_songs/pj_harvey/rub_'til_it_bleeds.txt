Speak, I'm listening
Baby, I'm your sweet thing
Believe what I'm saying
God's truth, I'm not lying

I lie steady
Rest your head on me
I'll smooth it nicely
Rub it better 'till it bleeds

And you'll believe me
Caught out again
I'm calling you weak
Getting even

And I, I was joking
Sweet babe, let me stroke it
Take, I'm giving
God's truth, I'm not lying

And you'll believe me
I, I, I'm calling you in
And I'll make it better
I'll rub 'till it bleeds

I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it, hey!
I'll rub it until it 
I'll rub it until it

I'll rub it until it, hey!
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
