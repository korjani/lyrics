I'm walking in the city tonight
I'm walking in the city at dark
Remembering, remember light
Thinking of nothing, and the shooting stars

And this world tonight is mine
A world to be remembered in
Think on a faded photograph
My hair longer than it's ever been

The sky lit up
The sky
My friend
The sky lit up
The sky my friend
And I'm lighter than I've ever been

I saw the trees crossing the moon
I saw the stars and heaven above
Shine on my own beautiful prayer
Shining on my own beautiful love

The sky lit up
The sky my friend
The sky lit up
I'm lighter than I've ever been

And I'm dancing with him
In this city and in this town
I don't care what he's thinking of 
Just take the car, just take my hand

The sky lit up
The sky lit up
The sky lit up
The sky lit up
