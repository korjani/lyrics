Threw my bad fortune
Off the top of 
A tall building 
But I'd rather have done it with you 

Your boy's smile 
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hungover
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
And just what it was worth

And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable 
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through 
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world

And I feel like....

So I take my 
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving
Like some modern-day
Gypsy landslide

Like some modern-day
Bonnie and Clyde
On the run again
