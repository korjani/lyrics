How could that happen? 
How could that happen again? 
Where the fuck was I looking 
When all his horses came in? 
And he built a whole army 
Of kamikaze

10,000 willing 
Pilots flying 
Interfacing 
Space and beyond 
Built an army 
To come and find me

Beyond all reason 
Beyond all my hopes 
The call of duty 
Another war zone
(Makes me moan)

Kamikaze - you can't touch me, kamikaze 

Eight miles high 
He walks his path 
And I follow mine 
One tooth for one eye 
He's come to find me

10,000 willing 
Pilots flying 
Interfacing 
Space and beyond 
Here is his army 
Interspace here we come

Kamikaze-you don't touch me 
Space here we come
