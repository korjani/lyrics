plants and rags  ease myself into a body- bag  
dreamt a man  he fed me fine food, he gave me shiny things

white and black  are you looking for the sun boy?  the sun doesn't shine down here, no, in shadow
house and home  who thought they could take away that place?  lead us outside, and lead us out quietly
