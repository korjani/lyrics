I'm coming up man-sized
Skinned alive
I want to fit
I've got to get
Man-sized
I'm heading on
Handsome
Got my leather boots on

Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down
Man-sized no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?

I'm man-sized
Man-sized

I'll measure time
I'll measure height
I'll calculate
My birthrite
Good Lord I'm big
I'm heading on
Man-size 
Got my leather boots on

Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down
Man-sized no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?

My babe looking cool and neat
I'm pretty sure good enough to eat
Man-size no need to shout
Let it all, let it all hang out

I'm man-size
Man-size [X7]

Silence my lady head
Get girl out of my head
Douse hair with gasoline
Set it light and set it free

Silence my lady head
Get girl out of my head
Douse hair with gasoline
Set it light and set it free
