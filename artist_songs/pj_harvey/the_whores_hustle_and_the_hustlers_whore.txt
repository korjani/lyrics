Speak to me of universal laws 
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore 
All around me people bleed 
Speak to me your song of greed

Speak to me of your inner charm 
Of how you'll keep me safe from harm 
I don't think so, I don't see 
Speak to me of your inner peace 

Little people at the amusement park 
City people in the dark 
Speak to us, send us a sign 
Tell us something to keep us trying 

The whores hustle and the hustlers whore 
Too many people out of love 
The whores hustler and the hustlers whore 
This city's ripped right to the core 

Speak to me of heroin and speed 
Of genocide and suicide, of syphilis and greed 
Speak to me the language of love 
The language of violence, the language of the heart 
This isn't the first time I've asked for money or love 
Heaven and earth don't ever mean enough 
Speak to me of heroin and speed 
Just give me something I can believe

The whores hustle and the hustlers whore 
Too many people out of love 
The whores hustler and the hustlers whore 
This city's ripped right to the core
