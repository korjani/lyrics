Sometimes I can see for miles 
Through water and fire 
From England to America 
I feel life meet my eyes

And it's the best thing 
A beautiful feeling 

A smile from San Diego 
He is still a boy 
Two ends to every rainbow 
And a train from Mexico

But he's the best thing 
A beautiful feeling

And when I watch you move 
And I can't think straight 
And I am silenced 
And I can't think straight

It's the best thing Such a beautiful feeling
