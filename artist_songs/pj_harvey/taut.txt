Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Can I tell you something ?
Can I tell you a story ?
It's about me and Billy
'Cause I remember

I remember it all started when he bought that car
It was the first thing he'd ever owned apart from me
And the color was red
And the color was red and he drove me
He drove me out of my mind
I'm over it now
It was spring or summer sixty five I don't remember
Steaming and sweating and sticking against the wheel
And I could see the tendons stand out in the back of his neck
And he used to make me pray, wearing a mask like a death's head
When he put me there in the back seat, and he said

Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Inherited his father's hate that what he'd say
And he custom of destruct the pain of every escape but somehow
He could make joy come loose inside
I would feel really I would feel really and truly alive
And I would do anything for him
It just wasn't enough
It was never enough
He'd turn to me and say
He'd, he'd say "even the son of god had to die, my darling"
And he wanted everything
He wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
Each new moon
He used to make me pray
Every morning
Hidden in the backseat, such Jesus
He'd make me pray
And he'd in there when he wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
Say it
"Even the son of god had to die my darling"
Go on, say it!

Jesus save me
Jesus save me
