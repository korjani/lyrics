Do you remember the first kiss? 
Stars shooting across the sky 
To come to such a place as this 
You never left my mind

I'm watching from the wall 
As in the streets we fight 
This world all gone to war 
All I need is you tonight

And I draw a line 
To your heart today 
'To your heart from mine 
A line to keep us safe'

All through the rising sun 
All through the circling years 
You were the only one 
Who could have brought me here

And I draw a line 
To your heart today 
'To your heart from mine 
A line to keep us safe'
