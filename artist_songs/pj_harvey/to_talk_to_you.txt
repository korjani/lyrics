Oh grandmother
How I miss you
Under the earth
Wish I was with you

To talk to you
To talk to you

I found somebody
Tried to give myself to
Many times
I wanted to talk to you

If I lay on the earth
Could you hear

Oh grandmother
I'm so lonely
All my life

If I lay on the earth
Could you hear then
If I lay...

Mary...
