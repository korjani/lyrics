How to stop the murdering?
By now we should have learned 
If we don’t then we’re a sham
Bad overwhelms the good
Bad overwhelms the good

Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

What I’ve seen 
Yes, it’s changed how
I see humankind 
I used to think progress was made
We could get something right
We could get something right

Enough is enough
A line in the sand
Seven or eight thousand people
Killed by hand
They stepped off the edge
They did not step back
If we have not learnt
By now
Then we’re a sham

When we first got to the camp
Our supplies were not enough
I saw a displaced family
Eating a cold horse's hoof
Oh a cold horse's hoof

Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We sent up tents
Brought in water
Air drops were dispersed
I saw people kill each other
Just to get there first
Oh just to get there first

Enough is enough
A line in the sand
Seven or eight thousand people
Killed by hand
They stepped off the edge
They did not step back
If we have not learnt
By now
Then we’re a sham

What we did?
Why we did?
I make no excuse 
We got things wrong
But I believe
We also did some good

What we did?
Why we did?
I make no excuse 
I believe we have a future
To do something good

Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
