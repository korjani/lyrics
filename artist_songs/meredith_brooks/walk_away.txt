Got a lot to say but I couldn't get it in
And we couldn't get along so it got in the way
I'll give you the spin and you couldn't even talk
But you never give in
Yeah I can fight with the best of them
And we've gone a few rounds and I shed a new light
And I counted to ten but it didn't seem to matter
You just wanted to win

I won't let you drag me in
I know you enjoy the pain
Oh you won't feel anything
Well I don't play that way

[Chorus]
It's a sure bet
The last thing you're ever gonna to hear from me
Are my footsteps
As I walk away (I walk away)
You've tried everything
To keep me coming back
Oh but I'm spent
As I walk away
One thing's for sure last thing you're 
Ever gonna hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away

You love to fight and I couldn't get through
And your blood is running hot makes you feel alive 
In everything you do and you want it that way
I can't abide by you
Look at the time I guess it went to waste
But I'm good to go I gotta toe the line
I'll make mistakes but I still got a chance
I'm gonna take

Everything you said
Is like a kick in the head
Don't count me out just yet
Place your money here instead

[Chorus]

Can't even tell me that you want me
But this time it's just all right
Something that you'll face in the morning
But baby if you want when I close this door 
I'll leave on the light

[Chorus]
