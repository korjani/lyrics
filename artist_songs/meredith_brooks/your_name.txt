You're everywhere I walk
I don't remember if I smiled
I don't think we talked
But you always hung around a while
And I don't know your name
Yeah I think that you were tall
I don't remember if I was ever nice to you at all

[Chorus]
Suddenly you come undone
You tell me I'm the only one
You hold my head up with a gun
And tell me that we are in love
You touch me and you want the same
I close my eyes and start to pray
And tell you I will be the way
You want if you will only say your name

You wrote me everyday
I never knew that it was you
I just threw it all away
I didn't know what else to do
Jesus told you to find me
And never ever let me go
And we would be so happy
He promised you that I would know

[Chorus]

I am sorry - so sorry oh
I am sorry Jesus forgot to tell me

I see that you are crying
I know you only meant to be with me
Maybe I was hasty
I should have listened more carefully
Please tell me it's not too late
Your decision has been made
Before you pull the trigger
Please won't you tell me your name?

[Chorus]
