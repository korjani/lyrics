I was wrong this was my mistake
I resolve to save what's mine again
I've always wanted to believe in things
And I pity you for taking that from me

You tried to erase the guilt that's on your face
But you're just hiding out behind your cool
Like a hurricane you changed
And because you took the blame
You thought that would be enough 
And then I'd be on my way

[Chorus]
Did you think that I would let you forget me? 
Did you think that I would just lie on the floor? 
As you walked into you future did you think I 
would give you control?
Well, you don't know me
Did you think that I would simply forgive you? 
Maybe you think I'd just lay down and die
As you walked away, didn't you think I'd survive? 
Well, you don't know me

My world changed like a thought replaced
I was faithful to the promises you made
When you say my name
Will it sound the same
As when you used to talk to me so cool ?
You want me to pretend
So you'll have your happy end
To wash away your guilt
And make it easier for you - oh

[Chorus]
