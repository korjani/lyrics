I was walking down the street doing nothing
When she ran right into me and I was wondering
If it could be that she didn't see
But she spit that hatred at my face
I felt like I wanted to fight
When I saw her hungry eyes and broken heart
And recognized her pain
I saw it I know it and I walked away
Only love could save her anyway

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry
That it's all for nothing

Sometimes I feel so confused when I look at us
And all we went through
After eight years of sharing every dream together
We don't even talk
Is that all there is
What we stood up for
Now we stand behind a million locked doors
And we can't even say that we'll be friends
Sometimes things just change and we don't know why
I don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry
That it's all for nothing

Do we all want to believe there's more to this
Than the lights just turning out

Now we gotta have a real conversation even if we don't
Know each other's situation
Who says we're powerless just because of all the injustice
There's still time to fight
You just gotta go you just gotta try
You're the only one that's standing in your way
Sometimes things keep changin' we don't know why
Don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry
That it's all for nothing
