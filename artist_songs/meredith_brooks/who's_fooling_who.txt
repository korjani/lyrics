You're so bad
You look so good
Charisma of a playboy
Who made it big in Hollywood
The money so fine
You're livin' high
The women, wine
Fly to the parties
But you won't be caught
Unless you bring a crowd
All the friends you bought
Cuz you wanna be sure
Your smile is seen
And your lookins good

[Chorus:]
I know I have become much stronger now these days
I don't need that kind of love
I'm on my way
Who-who's fooling who
No matter what you think or do
Oh, I can see right through
So who's fooling who

You don't even listen to me
When I SHOUT
Being at the top
Is all that you're concerned about
But someday baby
You're gonna be meeting me again
Got two faces for every move
You've done it for so long
They all look good on you
But it's too late baby
You looked in the mirror too long again

[Repeat chorus]
