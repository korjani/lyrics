Bought a ticket, destination nowhere
I am going then he smiled
It'd been awhile he said
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye love

She worked at the transfer station
No last words or consolations
Why I never lied
She cried, goodbye, bye, bye, bye love

He then took her off
He checked his line
The years went by
He found himself best he could find

Then a letter posted nowhere
Regards, I've arrived am doing fine
I missed you mine come save my life
My love, my life

She then put him on
She checked her line
She took her time
And on her heart she relied

Bought a ticket, destination nowhere
I am going then she smiled
It'd been awhile that smile
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye love

Train pulls into nowhere
There he stands a field of flowers
For his hands my love he cries
I missed you mine, come save my life

She says don't cry was only time
Moves in a line and then she smiled
And said besides I'm just passing bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye love
Bye, bye, bye, bye love
Bye, bye, bye, bye love, goodbye
