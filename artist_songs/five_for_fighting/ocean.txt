I got a thing for fish with no eyes
Who swim deep in the sea
With nothing to see 

I've got a thing for mountians of sand
Left all to their own
To quietly stand 

won't you help me now... 

Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...the ocean 

I got a thing for mermaiden tails
Swim naked with me
Your hair of seaweed 

I got a thing for sunken shipwrecks
With booty of gold
I don't care if it's wet 

won't you help me now... 

Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...the ocean 

I don't need no air.
