Love comes in, Love goes out 
Moves in circles, Roundabout 
We've been tired; 
We can't take it anymore 

Love can't change the weather 
She says I'm out of my mind, over my head 
Love can't change the weather 
But I'll rise to shade the sun when it blinds your eyes 

Love is born, Love is dead 
Runs in colours, Blues and reds 
We can't die; 
We can't waste it anymore 

Love in me, Loving you 
Makes it better, when love is true 
We are one; 
We can face any storm 

Love can't change the weather 
She says I'm out of my mind, over my head 
Love can't change the weather 
But I'll be holding you when the rain walks in 

Holding on... 

And if you're wondering; 
What is my take on this 
If you're wondering 
I'm out of my mind, over my head 
But I'll shade the sun if it blinds your eyes 

Love can't change the weather 
But I stand holding your heart, Keeping your hand 
Love can't change the weather 
I believe no act of God is stronger than you and me 

Love comes in, Love goes out 
We can't die...
