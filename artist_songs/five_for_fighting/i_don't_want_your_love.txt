If I lived so long to be the last man alive
My heart would never change
If I had the choice between a million eyes
I'd see you just the same
It's no secret you're the one for me
It's obvious to all
But, I don't want your love
I don't want your love

You say that providence brought me to you
That you would be my wife
Together we could start a family
And live a decent life
There's nothing more I'd rather say to you
Than swear the words I do
But, I don't want your love
No, I don't want your love

I would kill
I would die for you
I always will be true
If I could fix this thing you know that I would
But, only you can do
Cause it don't matter how much you love me
Or how I might love you

I don't want your love
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
My love

Until you love you too
