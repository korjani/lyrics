I know I should be happy in your land
It's not all that wild to me
Not that I want to be any other where
I know its hell out there 

Here in the borders of America Town
All of the dollies are spinning round and round
Hail to the chief
Lets just drag them all down
There's got to be a hero somewhere 

Used to get annoyed at the fire and the flag
Now it just seems old to me
(Everyone is old to me) 

And I know we'd kick your ass
But first I'll take a nap tonight
And know someone's looking out for me 

Here in the borders of America Town
All of the dollies are spinning round and round
Hail to the chief
Lets just drag them all down
There's got to be a hero somewhere 

I tried it
I've seen it 
I bought it all 

Not that I'm upset
I can still make my bet on the basketball game
And I got my spare change
I'm even O.K. with the hoodlums on the hill
They're in my will
Like her and you
Whom and who
In America Town
We all spin around
In America Town
I'm really not down:
We all spin around
In America Town
America Town
America Town
