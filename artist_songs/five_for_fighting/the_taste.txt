So I seen her 
In a land that was forgotten 
She brought a candle to my mind 
But it got no easier then 
So I snuck out of her apartment 
I went down to buy a premium 
But all that settled was my mind, for a time 
Till she showed me what a fire was 

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son 
I could be a dividend if you're my only one 

So I bought 12,000 acres 
Suddenly it was a dozen 
And for a moment I was blind but for the time 
I caught a glimpse inside the universe there 
I couldn't handle the dimensions 
See 2+2 can = 5 here 
So I sold off unto a lamb, but it was a scam 
And he giggled like he'd won the lottery 

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son 
I could be a dividend if you're my only one 

And all the children started singing 
There I fell into a coffin 
Brought the water in my eyes 
(Surprised) I wondered at the miracle there 

When it all was finally over 
I thought about our time here 
Here where everything's divine 
Well I find I still got the taste for you 
I still got the taste for you 
I still got the taste for you 
I still got the taste for you 

If you're my only one
