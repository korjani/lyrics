Mr. Merry cries in his coffin for days he says he can remember
And through the town the pallbearers sing old songs
Of a beautiful and purple mountain
From every walk of life we've come to see the Last Great American 
May I now present you the speaker
Friends he was a man of men, a man of gold
He had a how do you say ethical like sense
That's when the President started to giggle
Then the children gave the blessing 
Though the service weren't half done
Each of them sued the other one
For the last great American 

Mr. Reaches up and we bow our heads
He pulls the lid on down as his stone is read
Here lies our Merry the man with the heart so spent
That in this day and age is sick of living 

Then the funeral pyre was shattered
And the world became undone
The mourners raised their heads up
As the crowd began to run
Then everybody stopped... 

...to the beating of a drum. 

For through the smoke and morning sun
Stands the Last Great American
