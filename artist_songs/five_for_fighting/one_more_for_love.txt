Baby there's something on my mind tonight 
There's a reason to believe we almost got it right 
There's a fire burning in the firelight 
As we roll on tonight 

There's paper promises and alibis 
There is certainly uncertainty in all our eyes 
But as long as you are here I'll be all right 
As we roll on tonight 

So you go out...I'll go on 
If there's a doubt...we'll be strong 
As we go on singing 
One more for love my love 
One more for love... 

There's always blood to fill the heart betrayed 
There are children being born to every house that's raised 
And we're getting closer to where we got it made 
As we roll on tonight 

So you go out...I'll go on 
If there's a doubt...we'll be strong 
As we go on singing 
One more for love my love 
One more for love... 

I'm never going to wait for anything 
Never going to break for anything 
Cause I am one more for love my love 
One more for love 
One more for love my love 

Baby there's something on my mind tonight 
There's a reason to believe that we got it right 
And all and all you're all that's on my mind tonight As we roll on... 

One more for love my love 
One more for love
