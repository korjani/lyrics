Take off your shoes... Take off yourself 
Take off your rented mental health 
Take off your raincoat... settle down 
Take off your nightmare and your frown 
There is a place for you to go 
To see another ringer in a rock show 
Take my pretense for a time 
Cause I want to say to you 

I'm nobody without you...buddy 
My long lost friend 

If you're not here to hear me scream 
Am I silent like a dream 
Where all the dragons are my friends 
Each night we meet our bitter ends 
Do I need you to make me real 
Like Wheeler spinning his own wheel 
Quantum strings within my brain 
Popping sanities insane 

I'm nobody without you...buddy 
My long lost friend 

Not everybody has a brain 
Not everybody's going sane 
Not everybody wishes well 
Not everybody's heaven's hell 
Sometimes there's someone to blame 
Sometimes a place for shame 
Sometimes good's better than bad 
Sometimes good's better than bad 
Sometimes good's better than bad 
Sometimes you're better than me 

Heaven fell on herself tonight 
As the devil met me in the wishing well 
And in that moment I found myself knowing 
That in the end it's just about you and me 
Nothing smaller or larger 
Though dragons are good for the soul 
Nothing can be better than baring yourself for another... 
Open for scrutiny, ridicule, and indulgence 
Therein lies the balls, and the mind, and the heart... 
As fear is truly the Mindkiller... 
When nothing is left... 
Everything is gained... 
You see I wish I was a poet 
But I know as we go round and round 
Though endings are never ever happy 
It's the happy moments along the way 
That in the end 
Make it...ok...
