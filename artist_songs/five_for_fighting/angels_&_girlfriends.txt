I met her down at a Pineapple Parking lot 
She said I love you more 
I said I love you not 
And all the while I stood in line at the paint shop 

She said I'll take you where you'll never go again 
I'll be your only love 
You'll be my only friend 
And for your time I'll let you dine at my office 

Angels never come for free 
If you know what I know you know what I mean 
You can love em now - you can love em later 

Girlfriends never fall for fun 
They can tie you up make you come undone 
You can learn to fly - But you can't create her 

She led me down though a forest of wooden chairs 
As she ate my lunch I looked out for bears 
And in a sense you could say she snared my attention 

She said I am your perfect finality 
And as I got her off she got off her knees 
And for my grind I got honorable mention 

Everybody needs one 
Everybody's bound 
Everybody swings upon the Marry-Go-Around 

Girlfriends never fall for fun 
They can tear you up make you come undone...

So now I'm stuck in this pineapple parking lot 
I had what I was now I'm what I got 
And if I may... may I lend you some kind of direction 

If you go you may never come back again 
She's my only love 
She my only friend 
And for that there is no kind of protection 

Everybody needs one... 
Everybody's bound 
Everybody swings and meanwhile Mary Goes Around 

Angels never come for free 
If you know what I know you know what I mean 
1st you hate to love and then you love to hate her 

Girlfriends never fall alone 
Now you know what I know you know what I've known 
I'll see you now...and I'll see you later 
I'll see you later 
I think I can save her 
I wish I could date her
