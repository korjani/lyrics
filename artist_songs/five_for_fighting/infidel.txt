Heaven fell from the sky tonight 
There were virgins in my backyard chasing angels with fire sticks... 
Heaven fell on herself tonight 
And Moses lay in pieces from some 17-year-old bomb... 

Here we go...someone's knocking at my window 
Here we go...I didn't ask for this shit... 
Here we go...someone's knocking at my window 
Here we go...I didn't ask for it...ask for it...ask for it... 

Heaven fell from the sky tonight 
And the whole damn world invited themselves to my Sunday BBQ... 

Heaven fell and it's not all right 
And God won't dare show his face from of the bottom of my swimming pool... 

Here we go...someone's knocking in my window 
Here we go...I didn't ask for this shit 
Here we go...someone's knocking at my window 
Here we go...I didn't ask for it...ask for it...ask for it... 

La lee be la lee 
La lee be lo 
Here comes the fire trucks... open the show 
Here in the spotlight...which way did they go... 
Which way did they go... 

Heaven fell on herself tonight...
