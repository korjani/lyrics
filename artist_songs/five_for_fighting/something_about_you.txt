I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to get out there to see you
I don't know where to dig in.
I don't know how to get in there:to feel you 

It's been to long and I'm about to be in time for me
It's been to long and I'm in time 

Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to 
I'm going to hold on to that 

I never thought I would win
I never thought much about that.
(It's been a long time coming)
I never stopped to begin
Thinking about the process.
(It's been a long time coming) 

It's been to long and I'm about to be in time for me
It's been to long and I'm in time 

Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to 
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to 
I'm going to hold on to that 

I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to get out there to see you 

Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to 
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to 
I'm going to hold on to that 

It's been a long time coming
I'm going to hold on to that 

And I'm going to be there:be there:alright
