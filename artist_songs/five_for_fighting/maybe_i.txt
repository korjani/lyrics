You were right 
You came over me 
What'd never been before 
You slid under my door and now I find 
A Reason to admit I've been too lazy 

But in this light 
In this atmosphere 
I'm starting to believe 
The other side of me but who's to know 
Honey... surely one of us is crazy 

Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
Maybe I... I'm not the story for you 
Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 

So now I stand 
I never stood before 
What's better left unsaid is done, buried and dead and you're alive 
Girl I think you might just stay the night 

Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
Maybe I... I'll write a story for you 
Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 

I'm not trying to take it easy 
I'm not trying to help you see 
I'm not trying to take us over 
I'm just trying to believe 

Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
Maybe I... I'm just the story for you 
Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 

Maybe I... I'm not the one for your love 
Maybe I... I'll be your heaven above 
Maybe I... I'll write a story for two 
Maybe I... I'll be the do that you do
