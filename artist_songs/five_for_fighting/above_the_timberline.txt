I get a little tired 
Looking through the trees 
Sitting on the 405 
Hoping for a breeze 

Everybody's gunning 
You got something to see 
I gotta sell this ticket 
Get the shadow off of me 

So what is your problem 
You been moping around 
You need to find a mountaintop 
And get out of this town 

She says sometimes 
You gotta get away 
Clear out that noggin 
Open up the day 

Above the timberline 
The higher I go, the harder I climb 
I'm closer to you 
It's clear in my mind 
Love shines bright above the timberline 

Things get slower 
When it's harder to breath 
I can almost touch the stars 
That are hanging over me 

You've never been more beautiful 
And it's easy to see 
All that really matters 
You're all I'll ever need 

I'm getting to the home 
At the top of the world 
Leading to realities 
Up down at the curb 

Oh the noise between us, 
Now it can't be heard 
I'm listening to the wind 
I'm writing down the words 

Above the timberline 
The higher I go, the harder I climb 
I'm closer to you 
It's clear in my mind 
Love shines bright above the timberline 

Now I'll be coming home, 
I'll be coming home soon 
Before I head on down 
I'm gonna kiss the moon 

Above the timberline 
The higher I go, the harder I climb 
I'm closer to you 
It's clear in my mind 
Love shines bright above the timberline 

Above the timberline 
No heading up race, no waiting in line 
The farther I go 
The harder you climb 
Love shines bright above the timberline
