I woke up
You next to me
You said Good Morning
Are you Free
The sun crept in
For one last time
I was alive the day I died

The clock struck noon
But did not care
I saw a child
In my old chair
A shadow fell across your face
But all the years
Could not erase

I was alive, I was alive
You pulled me close
I held you tight
Though my smiles told a few lies
I was alive the day I died

I was the first to see a star
It seemed so close
It was so far
Wind started to roar
Screamed time to go
You know all you need
You need all you know

I was alive, I was alive
You pulled me close
I held you tight
And though our smiles told a few lies
I was alive the day I died

Oh Sweet Angel you call
Oh Sweet Angel you call
Oh Sweet Angel

White went black
Black went white
Universe cracked
I saw the light
You called my name
I did not respond
But I heard you well
Carried you on

Midnight came and I was gone
The planet shrugged and moved along
A few people noticed and sang my songs
I was alive the day I died
I was alive the day I died
