Augie Nieto's got a story to tell you 
Though it's hard to hear him speak 
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day 
Now he's happy as he'll ever be 

He's running through the night 
He'll die before he sleeps 
Augie's found what I've been looking for 

Augie Nieto can tell you he loves you 
He's two wheels close to God 
His captain Lynn sailing by his side 
He'll never leave you lost 

Though his arms can't squeeze you tight 
He'll hold you when you sleep 
Augie's found what I've been looking for 

Hey yeah, Hey yeah 
Take it any way it goes 
Hey yeah, Hey yeah 
Open up your never mind 
Open up your mind 

Augie Nieto has never been happier 
You got to see to believe 
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day 
Now he's carrying the whole team 

It's not the breaths you take 
It's how to breathe 
Augie's found what I've been looking for
