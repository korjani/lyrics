I know you have big plans ahead
Alterations
Filling up your mind
A little patience
Before you start to sand these corners
I'm warning you

I know you've put down
Our second chapter
But as an actor
Darling read between the lines
Before you take up the role of the reformer

You'll never change
You'll never change
Change me

You know I have this deep desire
For how you're wired
Intrigues me to no end
And I'm willing to do what I can do
Push the boundaries
Hang your picture
Mix your mixture
But don't expect to fix the color, the color of my eyes

You'll never change
You'll never change
Change me

Is it so wrong to be strong

Change
Change

You'll never change
You'll never change
Change me

I know you have big plans ahead
