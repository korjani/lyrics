Hey good looking
What you got cooking
I can see but I can't find the light

Please forgive me
If I don't have a smile to smile tonight

Don't you know
Life ain't pictures and words
And I don't care if you know that I'm hurting cause

I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
This time around

I see you're happy
Out there laughing
Must be nice to have your sweet revenge

I might be crazy
But I think I won this in the end, the end

Don't you know I can build my own house
You can try, but you can't throw me out because

I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down

They say you don't get what you want
But you get what you need
I don't know who they are
Or how they believe it

The truths in the tears
The fire and the fears
I'm standing on

I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
This time around
