Day by Day I wake up for you I do
and I rise to who knows who
well if I can say...some other day 

Day by Day I reach out to you I do
and I pretend there's something to it
And if I can say...I've had better days 

Day by Day I resort to you I do
and I wash up after you're through
If I can say...that's O.K. 

You're in my head again
You're in my bed again
You're in my mirror again 

And if you don't mind me...I don't mind you 

Day by Day I reflect on you I do
I reflect on you I do
