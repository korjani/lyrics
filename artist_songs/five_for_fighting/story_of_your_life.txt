At 17 she left Long Island bound for Hollywood 
Another story like the ones you've heard before 
He left her broken like you figured, like you knew he would 
She shut her heart after his ring rang off the door 

It's the story of your life 
You're tearing out the page 
New chapter underway 
The story of your life 
You live it everyday 
You can run, you run 
But you won't get away 
I don't know what's coming up 
Where will you go now 
It's the story of your life 

She hit the ground 
She built a fine career 
Every weekend walked her dog beside the sea 
In the salt she met a man who knew at once but wait 
Is he the one we need him to be 

In the story your life 
You're moving down the page 
As the words begin to change 
The story of your life 
You live it everyday 
You can run, you run 
But you won't get away 
I don't know what's coming up 
Where will you go now 
It's the story of your life 

Look around look around and the world will find you 
There's a reason that we live so far from Hollywood 
In the country looking hard to find a home 
We're nothing perfect 
All considered 
But we're so damn good 

It's the story of your life 
You're moving down the page 
And you know you're on your way 
The story of your life 
You live it everyday 
You can run, you run 
But you won't get away 
No one knows what's coming up 
Where will you go now 
It's the story 
It's your story 
It's the story of your life
