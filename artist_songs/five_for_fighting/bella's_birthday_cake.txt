Bella played the bridge every second loneliest night of the year
Took a certain liking to a fellow there - Bella
She said I brought her back to some old better man - fellah
Bella she was born today feeling kinda spry 
Bella's Birthday Cake was burning
Like Lightning, Like Fire
Bella's Birthday Cake was burning... 

Bella made her bed in red every loneliest night of the year
Tied me to the rages of her rocking chair - Bella
Fed me quiet offer through her ever wares - I'll tell ya
Bella she was born today feeling kinda spry 

Bella's Birthday Cake was burning
Like Lightning, Like Fire
Bella's Birthday Cake was burning
Ever yearning Forest Fire 

and all of her lines she left unread
"spirits and battles won," she said
and over her mountian tops she ground me off
where...I can't remember... 

Bella played the bridge on the second loneliest night of the year
Bella she was born today... 

BELLA'S Birthday Cake was burning
Bella's BIRTHDAY Cake was burning
Bella's Birthday CAKE was burning
Bella's Birthday Cake was BURNING...50 years gone.
