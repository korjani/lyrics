I'm Out of love again
And I need anyone
I'm out of love again
And I need everyone
I'm out. I'm in again
And I need some love
I'm out of touch again
And I need you babe 

I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love 

I'm out of wack again
And I need soft heat
I'm down to far too bend 
And I need something sweet 

I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love
I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff 

People in my life:you're the one
Of people in my life you're the one 

I'm out of love again
But I got your love
I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love 

I'm out of love again
Not while you're by my side
