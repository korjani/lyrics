Symphony Lane is a private court
That runs away from you
Symphony Lane is made out of notes
Silent as they're true

Symphony Lane is a shaded drag
With one house on the block
Park your car at the violins
Leave your heart unlocked

It's all around you, oh
It's all around you, oh
It's all around you
Overtures

Symphony Lane has sidewalks of gold
Providing no escape
Symphony Lane is one hundred years old
Born just yesterday

She's all around you, oh
It's all around you, oh
It's all around you
Overtures

It's all around you, oh
It's all around you, oh
It's all around you
Overtures

Symphony Lane is a one-way road
Wide enough for two
Symphony Lane is the only hope
I'm holding out for you
Symphony Lane is straight up ahead
Right around the bend
Think too fast
Drive too slow

You'll miss her once again
You'll miss her once again
You'll miss her once again
