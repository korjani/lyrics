Hey Kid... Your time has come to change 
Though I need you more than I've needed anyone in any way tonight 
Hey Kid... I know it won't be long 
The Captain's calling...come to see you back where we belong 

Something inside me is breaking 
Something inside says there's somewhere better than this... 

Sunset sailing on April skies 
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes 
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you he's in love with me 

Hey Kid...Do wishes count at all 
Can you give me a sign...give me anything I won't tell a soul you told 
Hey Kid...Will you hold me when I sleep 
Will you find me when the tide decides that I got to leave 

Something inside me is breaking 
Something inside says there's somewhere better than this... 

Sunset sailing on April skies 
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes 
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you he's in love with me 

Sunset sailing on April skies 
Bloodshot fire clouds in your eyes 
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you he's in love with me 

Something inside me is breaking 
Something inside says there's somewhere better than this my love 

Sunset sailing on April skies 
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes 
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you he's in love with me 

Sunset sailing on April skies 
Bloodshot fire clouds in your eyes 
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you... he's in love with me...
