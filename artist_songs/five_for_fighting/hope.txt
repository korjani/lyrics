When life's got you down and you can't make a sound 
Cause love has forsaken you 
When you burning on fire but have no desire 
To put out the flames in 

You gotta have hope 
You gotta have something 
There's always a reason to break 
Hope 
Cause nothing less 
Will save the day 

When you are in pain then step of the train 
Nobody's waiting for you 
You can knock down each door of all metaphors 
Or embrace the cold hard truth 

But you gotta have hope 
You gotta have something 
there's always a reason to break 
Hope 
Cause nothing less 
Will save the day 

I see that look in your eyes 
I've seen it before 
Each to our own disguise 
If you need me babe 
You're not alone, no, no 

When life's got you down and you can't make a sound 
cause despair has stolen your song 
but raise up your fist and into the abyss 
Scream,"Coward, get of my lawn" 

Hope 
Something 
There's always a reason to break 
Hope 
Cause nothing less will save the day
