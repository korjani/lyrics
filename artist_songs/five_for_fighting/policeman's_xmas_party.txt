Welcome to the first day of the rest of my life
The tension is so think you can cut it with a knife
Something's happened:Things will never be the same
There's blood on the carpet - I'm rewiring my brain

I got some new friends down at West Valley PD
You can change the channel but I'm all that's on TV
The only good news is that he's going to be o.k.
Got a bomb in my stomach but I'm dreaming that one day

I'll be going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get funky on the dance floor
Going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest of my life...

4 weeks later it's still Raining in the Park
Marine with a gun guards my house now after dark
I look for clues like I'm Inspector Clouseau
You can have my money honey I just want to go

Go to a policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get my funky on the dance floor
Go to a policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest of my life...

There's Cops on the ceiling
There's Cops on the floor
There's Cops in the windows
Cops breaking down the door
You'll never feel safer in your life
The Captain even likes to get freaky on my wife

We're going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get my funky on the dance floor
Going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest...

Welcome to the best day of the rest of my life
My buddies broke the case and now it's gonna be alright
Moral of the story, it don't matter who you are
Be careful what you wish for they'll be calling you a rock star

People from Earth there's never been a harder core
Party like this party in a million years or more
The floor itself is hopping like a freaking kangaroo
The D.J.'s in his P.J.'s playing..."everybody wants you!"

Going to a policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get funky on the dance floor
Going to a policeman's Xmas party
Going to have a good time the rest of my life!

Take off your clothes
Take off everything you are
Take off your heart
Get funky on the dance floor

Going to have a good time for the rest...
