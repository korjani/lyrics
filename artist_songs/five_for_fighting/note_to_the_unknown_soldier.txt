I don't know you 
I never met you 
For laughs I'll call you Sam 
You were the son 
Of Mrs. Someone 
I hope she understands 

Sam you were all that you had 
Are you happy or sad 
I never knew you 
But I'm told you're the best we had 

Were you so tall 
Did you play Basketball 
Was there a sweetheart at home 
Did you write her letters 
Did it make you better face the great unknown 

Sam did you feel alone 
You were so far from home 
I never knew you 
But I know you're the best man I know 

Could you tell it was time 
See it coming in the back of your mind 
When it was over, was it over 
Sam I'm glad you're on my side 

I don't know you 
I never met you 
Can I call you Sam 
Did you have a son 
A daughter with a little one 
I might go and thank Sam you're the best that we have 

You make me happy and sad 
If you were here, I'd buy the beers 
I'd shake your hand and say good man 
And though the sun would shine about the same 
It's a better world because you came 
Sincerely yours, my kids will know your name
