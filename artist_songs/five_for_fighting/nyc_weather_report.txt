Got to get away from here... 
Got to get away from all these thinkers... drinking up my thoughts again 
Got to get away from here... 
Got to get away from all these choosers, losers... all my best of friends 
Sit back New York City 
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty 
When the rain comes you fall up again... 
SUNNY... You are a part of me 
SUNNY... You are the heart of me 

Got to get away from here... 
Got to get away from all these people who need people... You know it really makes me sick 
Got to get away from here... 
Got to get away from expectations, recreations, just for the sake of it 

Sit back New York City 
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty 
When the rain comes you fall up again... 
SUNNY... You are a part of me 
SUNNY... You are the heart of me 

Sit back New York City 
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty 
When the rain falls you come up again 
Sit back New York City friend... 

Got to get away from here... 
Got to get away from what I'm thinking...I'm thinking...it's too much for anyone... 
Got to get away from here... 
Got get away from what you're drinking... you're drinking...so I'll take another one...
