There's no time to waste
In this famous goodbye
There's Angels landing on the shore

So lay down with me
Let the river run dry
It's Sunday in the six-day war

Smile darling don't be sad
Stars are going to shine tonight

Tell me where the good men go
Before I wash away
Walk me down the old brick road
So I can die where I met you
Hold me like we're going home
Turn your tears to rain
Bury me beautiful
Heaven knows how I loved you

There's a children's choir in perfect parade
Singing like they found the Lord
I can't say it they'll let me in
But we can dance the way we did
High above up the seventh floor

Smile darling don't be sad
Stars are going to shine tonight

Tell me where the good men go
Before I wash away
Walk me down the old brick road
So I can die where I met you
Hold me like we're going home
Turn your tears to rain
Bury me beautiful
Heaven knows how I loved you
And how I loved you

Father hear your Son
Do the good die young
Did I raise you up, raise you up
Make you Proud

Let the sun go out
Tear the bridges down
I'm on my way, on my way
I'm going home
Home

Tell me where the good men go
Before I wash away
Walk me down the old brick road
So I can die where I met you
Hold me like we're going home
Turn your tears to rain
Bury me beautiful
Heaven knows how I loved you

Tell me where the good men go
Before I wash away
Walk me down the old brick road
So I can die where I met you
Hold me like we're going home
Turn your tears to rain
Bury me beautiful
Heaven knows how I loved you

Heaven Knows
