I've been down and I'm nothing at all.
And sometimes I feel I've grown.
Never try to let it show, 
But I'm not alone.
If you sing this song, 
I'll take you there,
If you don't care.

Going to the Valley of Angels,
to swim in the deep blue sea.
Surrounded by your faith and your glory,
is where I find my peace
So peace,
In the Valley of Angels...
In the Valley of Angels.

Heard so many stories, I thought they were lies (but you know they're true.)
I know that I have quit before I even tried (ahhh, but you could not worry.)
I stood up one day and found myself.
But I'm not alone. 
If you sing this song,
I'll take you there.
If you don't care....  
Then go with me!

Going to the Valley of Angels,
To swim in the deep blue sea.
Surrounded by your faith and your glory,
is where I find my peace...
You know I find some peace,
...in the Valley of Angels.

[instrumental bridge]

All you ever dreamed to see..
You can touch, you don't believe.
Lying here on angels' wings....

Going to the Valley of Angels,
to swim in the deep blue sea.
Surrounded by your faith and your glory,
is where I find my peace...
You know i find some peace.
You know i'll take you there,
No, if you don't care....
Ohhhhh, in the Valley of Angels.

(Going to the Valley of Angels)  
To the Valley of Angels
(Going to the Valley of Angels)  
Ahaaaa.....yeah.
