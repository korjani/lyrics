Here I go
Trying to write another chapter in my life
Driving down this lonely highway deep inside
And where I'm going I don't really know
But here I go
Trying hard not to leave too much life behind
Is there something out there that I'm trying to find

I believe in love
Believe in us
But there are days when it's not enough

I'm not gonna change who I am
But I ain't gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
When it's all said and done
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love
I'm still willing to try

Here I go
Step into this spotlight on the stage
Finally realizing that I've come of age
Running my own race down life's lonesome road
So here I go
We only get one life we got to live
Let's hope we find the strength just to forgive.

If you believe in me
Like I believe in us
There ain't no way we're giving up

I'm not gonna change who I am
But I ain't gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
When it's all said and done
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love
I'm willing to try

When you're all alone
Feeling so far from home
Just hold on
'Cause I'm willing to try
When you're crying deep inside
Holding on to your pride
Just hold on cause I'm willing to try

If you believe in love
Believe in us
Gotta find the faith
To never give up

I'm not gonna change who I am
I'm not gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
Baby when it's all said and done
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love

I'm not gonna change who I am
I ain't gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
Baby when it's all said and done
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love
I'm still willing to try

Oh oh willing to try
