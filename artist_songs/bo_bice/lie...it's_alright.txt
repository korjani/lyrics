I’ll get you back
I’m out of cash
You can always count on me
Oh, I forgot 
C’mon baby just believe

You’re so good at telling lies
I’m like “here we go again”
And I don’t need no reason why
You could tell me anything
Just don’t think I don’t know
That I should let you go
But you’re beautiful tonight
So lie…it’s alright

(Keep saying whatever you want to believe, as long as you look like that, she says)

I’m over here
Around the way
You know I’m only stopping by
I thought you said
You said to me
Come on over here tonight
I don’t mind
I kinda like
All the stories that you tell
It’s obvious but I don’t care
Cause you’re doing it so well

You’re so good at telling lies
I’m like “here we go again”
And I don’t need no reason why
You could tell me anything
Just don’t think I don’t know
That I should let you go
But you’re beautiful tonight
So lie…it’s alright

It’s alright, it’s alright
No I wouldn’t change a thing
It’s alright

You’re so good at telling lies
I’m like “here we go again”
And I don’t need no reason why
You could tell me anything
Just don’t think I don’t know
That I should let you go
But you’re beautiful tonight
So lie…it’s alright

You’re so good at telling lies
I’m like “here we go again”
And I don’t need no reason why
You could tell me anything
Just don’t think I don’t know
That I should let you go
But you’re beautiful tonight
So lie…it’s alright
