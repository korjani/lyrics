Looking out the airplane window
Thirty thousand miles of shadow
All the silver linings bend into the night
Never any hesitation
Never any explanation
I wish I had a ticket off this flight

Everything keeps moving fast
What I want is what I have
Right now, I’m closer that I thought I could be

[Chorus:]
It’s my life, my time to find the answers
Don’t always know what kind of road is in front of me
But I’ll go slow wanna remember every moment
That this is by the goodness ride has ever been
It’s my life

In times I really miss my family
I wonder what they're doing right now
I know their thinking of me
I can’t imagine where I’m going
But I know where it is I come from
And it makes me feel complete

Everything keeps moving fast
What I want is what I have
Right now, I’m closer that I thought I could be

[Chorus:]
It’s my life, my time to find the answers
Don’t always know what kind of road is in front of me
But I’ll go slow wanna remember every moment
That passes by the goodness ride has ever been
It’s my life, it’s my life

And it’s a real good fight
Trying to find what’s mine
Tryin’ to be who I’m supposed to be
It’s my life, its my time to find the answers
Don’t always know what kind of road is in front of me
But I’ll go slow wanna remember every moment
That passes by the goodness ride has every thing
It’s my life
