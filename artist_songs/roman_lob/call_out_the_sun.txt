White bird on the wire, take my soul
Shed your tears on the fire
Come make me whole

White bird on the wind
Where do you fly?
Tell me where you've been
Where do you lie?
My, oh my...

Sweet thing, don't you hide - not from me
Sweet thing deep inside
We all believe
You flow through the veins of everyone
Now come and ease the pain
Cal out the sun
Call out the sun...

Call out the sun
Roll away the moonlight
What's done is done
Dust open the air
Call out the sun
Roll into a new life
A new day, my bird
And I will share

Got my eyes on the wire
My heart set on you
That old man desire
Burn me 'till I'm blue
Ashes from the fire
Where are they bound?
My bird upon the wire
Come on down
Share my ground

Call out the sun
Roll away the moonlight
What's done is done
Dust open the air
Call out the sun
Roll into a new life
A new day, my bird
And I will share

Call out the sun
Roll away the moonlight
What's done is done
Dust open the air
Call out the sun
Roll into a new life
A new day, my bird
And I will share

A new day, my bird
And I will share...
