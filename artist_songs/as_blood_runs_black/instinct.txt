I knew that this was the last thing
This was the last thing that I had to prove
Have all my struggles amused you?
This was the hardest thing to do
I chewed through the chains
With broken teeth in my mouth I was finally free
Free in my own mind (free in my own mind)
But I was always trapped inside

I will escape from this cage and extend my broken wings
I will escape from this cage and extend my wings

I walked out on everything that I ever knew and now
And now I find myself cold and alone
Searching for strength
The strength to stand on my own two feet
Approaching the edge, taking the leap
A leap of faith with my broken wings

As I rise to my feet I realize
I should be standing up for myself
Why haven’t you? What do you have to lose?
When there is so much to gain

I will escape from this cage and extend my broken wings
I will escape from this cage and extend my wings

Why haven’t you? What do you have to lose?
When there is so much to gain
