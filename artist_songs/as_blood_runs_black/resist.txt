We will overcome, we will overcome
Climb this mountain we face
We'll push through everything
Without
Without a reason to move
There is no living
Resist, resist the forces that drain
We carve our own path
Create our own way
Resist, the easy way out
There are no shortcuts through this maze of life
Burdened, but we will succeed
On the path that we've created
Make a decision
The choice changes everything
Commit yourself
There is no turning back
Overcome
And make this moment count
Make this moment count, make this moment count
Within each one of us
There's a coward and a king
Practice what you preach
To become what you believe
It's visible on the surface but not underneath
Now you can see perception is reality
It's all or nothing, you only have one life to live
Always remember
To remain on your path
And resist what holds you back
(We will overcome)
To remain on your path
(Move on)
And resist what holds you back
(Overcome)
