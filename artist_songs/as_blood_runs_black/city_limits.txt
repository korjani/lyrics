You made a deal with the devil in the city of angels

You'd give anything for just one taste of it
You've lost reality for what you dreamt up!
You'd do anything to create your legacy
So be careful what you wish for

It could cost you everything
You could lose everything

Where do you draw the line?

You made a deal with the devil in the city of angels
You ain't got no wings
So go back where you came from
