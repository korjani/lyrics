We are the ones that fight for freedom
United we stand
We walk through hell for you
And we are (we are) the protectors
Risking everything we have
Who will you look to when everything you know
Starts to crumble?

Enough is enough

Clinging to your memories
Will you dream of me or will I be forgotten?
Remember me

And when the struggle and the sacrifice
Becomes too great to bare
That’s when I look to the sky to discover who I am
And the reasons why I chose to let it all go
But I didn’t know that the cost would be so great
Do I leave it all behind and forget what I know?
Will I ever learn not turn to my back on the face of evil?

I only hope that someone’s watching over me
As I look my demons in the eyes, I wonder why I’m still here

We are the ones that fight for freedom
United we stand
We walk through hell for you
And we are (we are) the protectors
Risking everything we have
Who will you look to when everything you know
Starts to crumble?

Never forget, we will never forget

Remember
Those who sacrificed their lives
And honor – the legacy they left behind
Cherish their memories
Deliverance from this nightmare

We command you our brothers
Have courage and be strong
Awaiting your return for far too long
Welcome home!
