Your vision of a new life was impure
Gave into temptation and threw away what you believed
Your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
Your faults, your flaws, got the best of you
Your commitment, your pledge to another human being
Was destroyed through curiosity
Your goal in life is far out of reach
You'll find yourself out of luck
Branded into your cest-doomestic livestock
Society kept track of your defiance
Branded into your chest-domestic livestock
Terror embedded into your thick mind
Bearing your emblem with pride
Plagues by its purpose in geness
Subsequently flaunting its meaning
Your vision of a new life was impure
Gave into temptation and threw away what you believed
Infestation
Roc-a-way
Your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
Your faults, your flaws, got the best of you
Got the best of you, got the best of you
Your guard was let down
Your past turned against you
Your guard was let down
Your past turned against you
