Judged by appearance, and misspoken words
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard
Have you heard of rumors?
Some clash with lies
One degrades another out of despite
Inhumanity

[chant:] how can one
Claim to be perfect despite the things he has done
[chant:] how can one
Be so blind to see, you're no fucking different than me
Different than me
Maybe it's me, I'm not trying to change the world
But actions speak louder than words
And all in time I'll learn from the mistakes that are mine
But I wont forget those mistakes done unto me
Done unto me

Who am I to judge, use judgmental words?
What matters is appearance?
Or what you heard?
Live by what you have and believe
Judge by appearance, and misspoken words,
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard

Have you heard of rumors?
Some clash with lies
One degrades another out of despite
Out of despite
I'm human
I'm not perfect just like you
