Reclaim the kingdom that we all have built!
With our own calloused and broken hands
We've tried (WE'VE TRIED!) to mend the cracks
But it's slowly becoming a erect dystopia

...Like leeches extracting from the harvest
Depleting our resources
They keep taking away!

Enslaved in our own kingdom
We feed the King Of Thieves - Seek Liberation
We keep giving the gift of blood
And sweat for nothing
A stab in the back

Forever Imprisoned!!!!!!

A disgrace to the domain you keep
An embarrassment to the throne
You left us with no choice
We must overthrow - Take the crown!!

We are past the point of understanding
No longer under your reign of corruption!
We will not serve you!

Never again allowed to hold us back

It's your choice, It's your choice to abide or
Watch the world pass you by
False pretenses only makes you blind

It's only making you blind.
