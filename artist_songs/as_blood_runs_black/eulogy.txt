I am not who I once was, and I'm not who I'll always be
Remember me, remember me, remember!

Did you ever feel the same about me?
And did you ever feel the same about you?
LIVE LIFE, LOSE, LEARN
Did you ever feel the same about me?
LIVE LIFE, LOSE, LEARN

And I don't know but it feels like life is changing
Just don't give up this will only get easier [2x]

I cannot feel like I'm nothing, I'm already numb
My whole life isn't for nothing, it's only begun

And I don't know but it feels like life is changing
Just don't give up this will only get easier [2x]

REMEMBER!
