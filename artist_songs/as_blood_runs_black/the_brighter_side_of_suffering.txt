A struggle of change that is made
A wrinkle in time, battle of the brave
Fighting for hope of one's beliefs
Deceiving thought planted in minds
When hell freezes over will come the time
That one's point will have been made
There's shattered thoughts, and broken dreams
Wasted lives all for the brighter side of suffering

There's more than fighting for cause
There's fighting for what you believe
If there's a fork in the road of your path
One side needles the other's glass
At least you're walking instead of dragging on what's paved
Some see the glass half empty, others full
I just see the water's cold
And so is this world that we live in
And so I segregate
Separated from the ones without a cause
I segregate
I segregate
Would would you believe?
Could you believe?
There's more to this than what it seems
It's the brighter side of suffering
Poverty, injustice, struggling with the pain
A humble mind of wisdom and non-corruption
Would you believe?
There's more to this from this life
There's more to this
Finding a solution
Hope for tomorrow, for a better today
A new revolution
We stand and fight and face the pain
