This procession goes on and on
Disillusion is getting the best of me, but still I try
And I try – with all that I have only to find that
I’m digging my own grave now
Where I finally sleep under the legacy of
The undying obsolete
This won’t be the end and I will change this position
Where I have no control
And turn the tables back

Only rats flee a sinking ship
Men of honor stay aboard
To mend broken boards and sail on
Obtain the vision that they seek
Manifesting their own prophecies
Leave the weak in the wake of perpetual regret

We’ll rebuild and we will prevail – the wait is over

Relief from this pain comes from learning to
Start all over again
We’ll rebuild and prevail

And we will silence all those
Silence those who oppose
And we will silence
Silence those, silence those who oppose

While you sit and stare at the rising sun
Never knowing what lies beyond the horizon
You’re digging your own grave now

Buried in unending darkness
You choose to wait and live your life
In fear of the challenge
Never to witness daylight again
