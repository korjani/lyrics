Wait
There was a brighter day
Where I could view the world
Without the sorrows that I've known (What if I could feel)
Now it's a different place
Memories fade away
Without a trace
But there's a shadow
A shadow I can't feel

My eyes are closing softly (I never wanted to be)
Inside these walls I fade away (I never wanted to be)
Still holding on 'cause this is

Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder
Waiting for the sun to rise again
Crawling closer
So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over
I won't fear anymore

Wait
I know it's not too late
Even though the innocence is scarred
There's still tomorrow (What if I could see)
I could just escape
Close my eyes and dream about
A sentimental vision
A vision I could feel

This time I won't go softly (I never wanted to be)
Refuse to simply fade away (I never wanted to be)
Still holding on 'cause this is

Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder
Waiting for the sun to rise again
Crawling closer
So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over
I won't fear anymore

What if I could feel
What if I could see (What if I could see)
Again

It's far from over
And I am crawling closer

Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder
Waiting for the sun to rise again
Crawling closer
So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over
I won't fear anymore

Far from over
Far from over (Waiting for the sun)
Far from over
I won't fear anymore
