They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there; we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into "who's leaving here with who?"
But I just want 'em all to see me come in...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
[x2]

Oh, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
