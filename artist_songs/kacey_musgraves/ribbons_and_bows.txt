Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a round trip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
I walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their who's-its and whatnots

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love
