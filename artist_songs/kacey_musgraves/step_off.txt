You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb or are you blind?
Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning a knife
Don’t wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

Step off, step off
Yeah you’re getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just tryna to make a little difference here
So, why you gotta interfere?
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off, yeah

You screwed everybody over in this town
There ain’t nothing between you and the cold hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

So, step off, step off
Yeah, you’re getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just tryna make a little difference here
So, why you gotta interfere?
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top, hmmm
Step off

Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you’ll be up there all alone

So, step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off, step off, step off
