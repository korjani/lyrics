You take another pill just to kill another hour, ha
and then you're smokin' cigarettes and you're countin' dead flowers
'cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...

Love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

Candy coated promises they're always tryin' to sell ya,
But there's a whole lot of stories that the books never tell ya,
and you're cryin' and sleepin' in your clothes...

'Cause love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
'cause the grass is always greener through the rose colored glass
There's a reason for the pain is what they say if you ask
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass

'Cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...
'cause love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar
yeah, love is a liar (here we go good two three always push you in your face can't eat can't sleep why's it always gotta be a liar)
