Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do then so what
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

Let's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmmmm

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard,
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Mmm, mmm, mmmm, mmmmmmm
Die fun
We can't do it over
