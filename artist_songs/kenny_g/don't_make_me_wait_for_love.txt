Sitting here, just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion
We could have it all

Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we can't let love slip away

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Ooh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Hmm, I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness
Fall asleep alone
Give me a sign, a man ain't supposed to face life
Standing on his own

When you're near me, I can't help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can,t you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, yeah
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find, ooh, baby
Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, I need you, baby
I love you, I need you, I want you, baby
