Now that we are older,
Our hearts have all grown up.
Just a little wiser,
But are we wise enough?
Watching imitations of the real thing.
You and I have both been fooled before.

But this time, we win.
Our ship has just come in.
Forget the past.
We've saved the best for last.

Now that we are younger
Than we were last night.
You can be my arrow,
I'll be your guiding light.
There isn't any danger we can't handle.

But this time, we win.
Our ship has just come in.
Forget the past.
We've saved the best for last.
Tonight entwined.
This love is genuine.
Forget the past.
We've saved the best for last.

We've both had enough of hesistation.
Didn't matter, didn't matter.

But this time, we win.
Our ship has just come in.
Forget the past.
We've saved the best for last.
Tonight entwined.
This love is genuine.
Forget the past.
We've saved the best for last.
