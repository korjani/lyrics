There's been so many times 
My heart has been broken into
I kept them waiting in line
Coz nobody's heart was true
For every time I gave into love
I would always end up blue
And just when I was about to give up
I found myself an angel call to you

I've been waiting a lifetime for
Somebody to love me like you do
(oh yeah,oh yeah)
I was thinking that I'd always 
Be lonely but God came up 
With someone like you
Just to think I had made 
Up my mind love was over
Somebody gave me the love
That somebody was you

I told you night after night
I prayed for someone like you
But no one ever was right
They could not compare to you

I wasn't sure if I could endure
If things just stay the same
I didn't know if God had in store
A day without you loving my way

I've been waiting a lifetime for
Somebody to love me like you do
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
I was thinking that I'd always be 
Lonely but God came up 
With someone like you
Just to think I had made up my mind 
Love was over
Somebody gave me the love
That somebody was you

I've been waiting a lifetime for
Somebody to love me like you do
(baby)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
I was thinking that I'd always be
Lonely but God came up
With someone like you
Just to think I had made up my mind
Love was over
Somebody gave me the love
(somebody gave me the love)
Somebody gave me the love
(opened my heart and gave me love)
Somebody gave me the love
(somebody gave me the love)
That somebody was you....
