Mhmm, mmm, oh,

It's 3:00 AM, got my eyes wide shut,
I toss and turn, got the sheets untucked,
You broke right in, yeah, you stole, you took,
With dirty fingerprints, you no-good crook,
You shatter my heart like a Tiffany glass,
I knew from the start he was a thief in a mask,
And now I'm alone, cleaning up this mess,
There ain't nothin' left,

He's just a criminal,
He's just a criminal,
I can't get back what he stole,
He's just a criminal,

Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,

I hear the rain on this old tin roof,
The rusty nails in the boards comin' loose,
Spend my last two dollars on you,
You robbed me blind and you left no proof,
Poof, poof, mmm, disappear,
You should be sentenced for a thousand years,
You should pay me back for a thousand tears,
Insulting,

He's just a criminal,
He's just a criminal,
I can't get back what he stole,
He's just a criminal,

Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh no,

Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting, ooh,
Insulting.
