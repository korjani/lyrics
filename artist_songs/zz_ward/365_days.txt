Your clothes out on the blacktop
Scattered suits on the street
Frames and broken pictures in the mid-September heat
We set these nights on fire
So hot, we burned it down
Now all that's left of us is ashes on the ground

I told you back in June
You knew damn well what I would do

Three hundred sixty five days
You been making me wait
So keep your two-timing games
It's a lot of too late
The summer's over, over, over
Over, over, over

Drop your keys from six stories
Shout out, "It's raining green!"
Don't tell lies in heaven or an angel will get mean
Diamonds and white gold watches
Watch how fast they will soar
You always said you wanted to give back to the poor

I told you back in June
You knew damn well what I would do

Three hundred sixty five days
You been making me wait
So keep your two-timing games
It's a lot of too late
The summer's over, over, over
Over, over, over

I won't be your debutante
Won't be the fool to your savant
I can't fix your cracked up dreams
While the leaves fall off these trees
I won't spend the winter nights
Holding on to what ain't right
You might break your words real fast
But mine are made to last

Three hundred sixty five days
You been making me wait
So keep your two-timing games
It's a lot of too late
The summer's over, over, over
Over, over, over

Three hundred sixty five days
You been making me wait
So keep your two-timing games
It's a lot of too late
The summer's over, over, over
Over, over, over now

Over now
