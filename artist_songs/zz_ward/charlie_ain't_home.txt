Golden honey drippin' from this house,
Black stilettos on a leather couch,
Jeans stickin' tight like glue,
Soakin' wet, drink it up like juice,
Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,

Lay me down on sheets of cotton, whoa, whoa,
You make me feel like I could fly, whoa, whoa,
Headlights on the bedpost, we ain't stoppin', no, no,
If you forgot, I'll tell you why,
'Cause Charlie ain't home,

Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home,
Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home,

I dig my fingertips into your back,
Till the pictures break and the floorboards crack,
Oh, my tongue is a silver key,
Swimmin' deep in a sinner's sea,
Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,

Lay me down on sheets of cotton, whoa, whoa,
You make me feel like I could fly, whoa, whoa,
Headlights on the bedpost, we ain't stoppin', no, no,
If you forgot, I'll tell you why,
'Cause Charlie ain't home,

Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home,
Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home,

Oh, Charlie, Charlie,
Please let that boy go, darlin',
It wasn't his fault, it was mine,
Oh, Charlie, Charlie,
He didn't know no better,
I should have listened, you were right,

Lay me down on sheets of cotton, whoa, whoa,
You make me feel like I could fly,
Headlights on the bedpost, we ain't stoppin',
If you forgot, I'll tell you why,
'Cause Charlie ain't home,

Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home,
Ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home
