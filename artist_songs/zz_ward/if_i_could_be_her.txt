She's got Chanel up on her lips
A four inch skirt down on her hips
And all I got is just a couple pair of jeans
She's so hot, and she's the only thing you see
If I had her heals on I would never do you wrong
She treats you like a patient
With the lies she's got you on
Turn the lights off
Cause I'm all yours
Cover you in my curves
I'd give ya what you deserve
We could get lost
Get the lines crossed
Run ya like a fever
Woah if I could be her
Woah woah oh
I'd keep you forever
She's got the perfect little car
I drive a Chevy with the paint peeling off
She's got her daddy's credit card
I play for dollars down on Diamond Boulevard
If I had her heels on I would never do you wrong
She treats you like a patient
With the lies she's got you on
Turn the lights off
Cause I'm all yours
Cover you in my curves
I'd give ya what you deserve
We could get lost
Get the lines crossed
Run ya like a fever
Woah if I could be her
Woah woah oh
I'd keep you forever
If I was her, I'd be your silver lining after the storm
Cause I can't stand seeing you crying no more
Turn the lights off
Cause I'm all yours
Cover you in my curves
I'd give ya what you deserve
We could get lost
Get the lines crossed
Run ya like a fever
Woah
Turn the lights off
Cause I'm all yours
Cover you in my curves
I'd give ya what you deserve
We could get lost
Get the lines crossed
Run ya like a fever
Woah if I could be her
