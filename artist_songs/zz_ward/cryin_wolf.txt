Baby, nobody knows a word that you're saying,
Your breath is reeking like whiskey,
What hair you got left is graying,
You're out on my porch yelling, waking the neighbors,
Wanting me to come and save you with your aggressive behavior

You're stumbling all over town,
You drink till you drown,
You keep on threatening to bring me down,
You don't make the rules,
You drunk old fool,
See, you don't scare me, you're just crying wolf

Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy

Breaking my door down when I left the lock open,
There ain't much left to be broken,
Your flies are wet, then you're soaking,
It's like the devil just jumped up in your clothes,
He put on your shoes and rolled,
Thanks to you, I'm scared to be alone

You're stumbling all over town,
You drink till you drown,
You keep on threatening to bring me down,
You don't make the rules,
You drunk old fool,
See, you don't scare me, you're just crying wolf

Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry, boy,
Cry, cry boy,
Cry, boy

Nobody knows what you're saying (I mean, you need to)
I know the game that you're playing (I mean, you need to)

Don't forget about us, don't forget about trust,
Don't forget about the kinkiness of playing with the
cuffs on the bedspring,
Penetrate the loud screams, echoing the hallway is a must,
I could never let go if I wanna whore, duck
Away from your anatomy, the agony is such a pain I could never endure,
Even if I had the cure with the pure, sweet morphine touch,
I mean, I cannot deny my demise,
To lies, that interfere our future,
I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don't pin no lies,
I'm used to you forgiving and then forget the truth,
I promise that I'll commit,
Vamoose to all of my old ways,
I'm done, I live today,
A full moon will never exist, I swear

You're stumbling all over town,
You drink till you drown,
You keep on threatening to bring me down,
You don't make the rules,
You drunk old fool,
See, you don't scare me, you're just crying wolf,

Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy,
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy.
