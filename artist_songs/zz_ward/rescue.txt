Sweet love of mine, there is nothing to fear
I'll hold you close, let my sleeves catch your tears
Rock you to sleep when you've had your bad dreams
Sing you a song when you just can't go on
I'll keep you warm when the fire's getting cold
Straight through the storm, until we're grey and old
And if it all came crashing to the ground
I'd be the one, the one to hold it down

Oh, when you feel like you're giving up
I will rescue you
When you feel like the world's too much
I will rescue you
When your strength is not enough
I will rescue you, it's true, it's true
I'll rescue you, I'll rescue you
I'll rescue you, and I'll rescue you
I'll rescue you

Sweet love of mine, as the sun creeps through the blinds
You watch me while I'm sleeping, my secrets that you're keeping
And I can't explain, it's something so engrained
Like living in my memory, a dream about you and me
We walk past the vultures, Ray Charles to their hate
We stayed strong like soldiers and now we're fucking great
And if it all came crashing to the ground
I'd be the one, the one to hold you down

Oh, when you feel like you're giving up
I will rescue you
When you feel like the world's too much
I will rescue you
When your strength is not enough
I will rescue you, it's true, it's true
I'll rescue you, I'll rescue you
I'll rescue you, and I'll rescue you
I'll rescue you

I'd do anything for you, I swear that that is true
I'd cross the ocean, touch the sun and bring you back the moon
Never have I felt this way about anyone before
It's like you got me lifted, like you opened up some door
So give me all your troubles, I'll take them all away
I'll be there on the double, I'll always keep you safe
And when you think you're drowning I will resuscitate
And when you're close to broken, I'll never let you break

When you feel like you're giving up
I will rescue you
When you feel like the world's too much
I will rescue you
When your strength is not enough
I will rescue you, it's true, it's true
I'll rescue you, I'll rescue you
I'll rescue you, and I'll rescue you
I'll rescue
