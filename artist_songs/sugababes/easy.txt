Engine's running high baby can you come and check it?
Got such a pretty kitty, boy I know you want to pet it
The weather's nice and wet just south of the border
I can cook up anything that you have to order

[Verse:]
Come on baby
I'll make it easy
Come on honey
I'll make it so easy for you

[Chorus:]
Anything that you want boy (you know it got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)
And whenever you're gone boy (I just can't stand it)
You just make me lose my mind

Hey Mr postman where's the mail for my mailbox?
I wanted sex on the beach and I don't mean on the rocks
It's your serve baby but the ball's in my court
I've got a landing strip clear for you at the airport

[Verse]

[Chorus]

Oohh ooooohhhh

Anything that you want boy (you know it got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)
Anything that you want boy(you know it got it)
Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it)

[Chorus]

Ohhhh oooooohhhhh

Come on baby
I'll make it easy
Come on honey
I'll make it so easy for you
