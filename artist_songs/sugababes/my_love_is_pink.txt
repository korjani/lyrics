Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink
Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink

Thinking about the way that I can say,
Maybe there's more to me than you see baby,
So many different ways to misbehave,
Big numbas and I will make it eighty

[Chorus:]
Dance on the spot,
Givin' it all we got
Fire in my eyes, baby I can't disguise
That deal that we did, gettin' me in the mood
If I could make a man he'd look a lot like you
My love is pink, everybody knows what you think
My love is white, but it won't amount to much tonight
My love is red, hotter than the terrible things you said
My love is light, the colors of the girls oh what hold tight

Talkin' about what's never gone before,
Lettin' you work your way around my body.
Whatever you got i'm guessin' I got more.
Even with no regrets you won't be sorry.

[Chorus]

And I'll be true, true to my word
Oh baby, I will be true
If you, give me your word,
Then maybe, I'll show you the moves

Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink
Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink

[x2]
My love is pink, everybody knows what you think
My love is white, but it won't amount too much tonight
My love is red, hotter than the terrible things you said
My love is light, the colors of the girls oh what hold tight

Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink
Love, love everybody, everybody
Love, love everybody, is pink
