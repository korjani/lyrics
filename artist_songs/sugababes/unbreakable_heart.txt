You might think I would know better than this by now 
That I should be strong enough to resist somehow 
Even letting myself wish is a risk, I know 
To let go and to kiss is just asking for the blow 

You might think I would see clearer this time around 
Now i'm done doing payments for your crimes, i'm done 
Then again how can something this sublime be wrong 
If you can't stand the fall then you better hold on 

This is how it begins 
With a smile 
With an inch 
Take a mile 
Then again 
What's another little sin? 

If I walk through my whole life 
Choosing the safe side 
And staying smart (don't you know) 
I'll miss out on the real thing 
It's all or it's nothing 
That's why it hurts (they go) 
What good is an unbreakable heart? 

I'm not try'nna tell you nothing 'bout right and wrong 
It's a whisper and it's growing into a song 
Are you looking for somewhere where you can belong 
Won't you come on over here, we got something going on 

This is how it begins 
With a smile 
With an inch 
Take a mile 
Then again 
What's another little sin? 

If I walk through my whole life 
Choosing the safe side 
And staying smart (don't you know) 
I'll miss out on the real thing 
It's all or it's nothing 
That's why it hurts (they go) 
What good is an unbreakable heart? 

If I walk through my whole life 
Choosing the safe side 
Then what do you know? (what good is an unbreakable heart?) 
I'll miss out on the real thing 
It's all or it's nothing 
There you go (what good is an unbreakable heart?) 

If I walk through my whole life 
Choosing the safe side 
Then what do you know? (what good is an unbreakable heart?) 
I'll miss out on the real thing 
It's all or it's nothing 

Then again 
What's another little sin? 

If I walk through my whole life 
Choosing the safe side 
And staying smart (don't you know) 
I'll miss out on the real thing 
It's all or it's nothing 
That's why it hurts (they go) 
What good is an unbreakable heart?
