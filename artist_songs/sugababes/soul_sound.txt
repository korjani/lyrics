I, touch the sky, all around, in our eyes
And who wouldn't believe
What's happening to me
Expectations all around
My intuition knows no doubt I could
Lose my way on this merry-go-round

So I, like a bird will fly
To see
Just what could be
And patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold on me
There's magic in the air
I wanna breathe
Change, change all around
Go with the rhythm

The soul sound (oh mmm)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (oh mmm)
The soul sound

So I, like a bird will fly
To see
Just what could be
(What could be yeah)
Patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold on me
There's magic in the air
I wanna breathe
Change, change all around
Just go with the rhythm

The soul sound (oh mmm)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (feeling free)
The soul sound

Dun-duna, duna-duna, dun-duna, oooh
Soul sound
Dun-duna, dun-duna, dun-duna, dunnn
Wait a minute soul sound
Ahh, ooh ahh, ooh ahhh, ooh ahhh

The soul sound (oh mmm)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (mmm, mmm)
The soul sound (wait a minute soul sound)
