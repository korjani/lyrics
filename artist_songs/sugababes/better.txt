World, where I am drowning I sink so slow 
The under tow 
Dragging me down just like all my fears 
Trying so hard not to disappear 
There's nothing clear 
Want something to believe in 

Nearly crushed my soul (my soul) 
Nearly lost control (control) 
I knew I had to find some peace of mind on my own 

[CHORUS:]
This is the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...) 
No falling apart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...) 
You have to look it in the face 
And recognize it's you that makes you 
Right from the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...) 
Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...) 
You have to look it in the face 
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way 
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow 

In dark there's no believing
You're only left with fear
Talk me out of right from wrong 
Make me sing a different song 
No time to hide, I'll move on... 

Nearly crushed my soul (my soul) 
Then I found a goal (a goal) 
I knew I had to find some peace of mind on my own

[CHORUS]

Now I know (uh-uuuhh) 
Cause now I know I'm right (uh-uuuhh) 
You could be here with me (uh-uuuhh) 
I'll meet you now to tell you things are gonna be alright (alriiiight) 

[CHORUS x2]
