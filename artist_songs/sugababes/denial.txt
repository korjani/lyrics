Somewhere in the back of my mind 
Secretly I know you will find 
Me amongst the blushing and glow 
Deep beyond the things I don't show 

Mystery's a beautiful thing 
What a gift a woman can bring 
Never let it out just like that 
Let him slowly figure it out 

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day? 
And at night 
You gotta let the water drain in 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial 

You were like a power of nature 
Telepathic beautiful creature 
Understanding all of my weakness 
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it 

Cynical and hurt was just me 
You were never supposed to be 
Part of what I would call amazing 
Took so long to finally see 

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day? 
And at night 
You gotta let the water drain in 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial 

I see the way the wind blows 
Like open minds for us 
No complicated barriers 
To hold us back 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial 

I didn't wanna fall in love with you 
I didn't wanna know the things I knew 
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror 
Denial
