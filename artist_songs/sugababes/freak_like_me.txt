Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside 
And you know that a man has gotta feel with it (with it, with it) 
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cos it's all about the dark in me (mmm)

I wanna freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
Just like me
I need a rough neck brother that can satisfy me
Just for me 
If you are that kind of man
'Cos I'm that kind of girl
I've gotta freaky secret everybody sing
'Cos we don't give a damn about a thing

Cos I will be a freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can all through the night
To the early morn
Come on and we'll take you around the hood
On a gangster lift
'Cos we can any time of day
It's all good for me

Boy you're moving kinda slow
You gotta keep up now
There you go
That's just something that a man must do (mmm mmm) 
I'm packing all the things that you need
I got you shock up on your knees
'Cos it's all about the dark in me, yeah

I wanna freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
Just like me
I need a rough neck brother that can satisfy me
Just for me

Until the dawn
And we can all through the night
To the early morn
Come on and we'll take you around the hood
On a gangster lift (Take you round the)
'Cos we can any time of day
It's all good for me

Good for me...
Good for me...
Good for me...
