If I could hold you close
Like you were never gone
If I could hear your voice
You'd tell me to be strong

But sometimes
I just can't
I just don't understand
Why you had to go
Why you had to go
I guess I'll never know

Ain't it funny how you think
You're gonna be OK
Till you remember things ain't never
Gonna be the same again
The same again
Ain't it crazy how you think
You've got your whole life planned
Just to find that it was never ever
In your hand
In your hand
Change

If I could get to you
I'd be there in a minute
My world don't make no sense
Not without you in it

And sometimes
I just find
Can't say I
Don't know why
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
And leave me here alone

And leave me here alone

Ain't it funny how you think
You're gonna be OK
Till you remember things ain't never
Gonna be the same again
The same again
Ain't it crazy how you think
You've got your whole life planned
Just to find that it was never ever
In your hand
In your hand
Change

You don't see it coming
Change
When the future comes knocking
It changed
It can make you or break you too
You'd just have to make it through
(You'd just have to make it through)

Ain't it funny how you think
You're gonna be OK
Till you remember things ain't never
Gonna be the same again
The same again
Ain't it crazy how you think
You've got your whole life planned
Just to find that it was never ever
In your hand
In your hand
Change

Change, change
Change, change
