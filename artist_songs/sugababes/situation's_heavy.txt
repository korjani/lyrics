Making decisions about my life
It's up to me and I start to try
I can't keep running away
Trust my instincts right or wrong
Refusing help try to be strong
I'll fight this one today

Here's my point of view
Wouldn't wanna offend you
Wanna do the best to prove
Push your face ain't gonna lose
Deep and twisted but I refuse
Don't want advice but help to choose

I'll just walk these tracks alone
Use it as a stepping stone

[Chorus:]
Trying to face it all alone
Had to find my own way home
No matter how hard it may be
The situation's heavy
I'm not growing old before my time
Even when there's warning signs
That consequently I can see
The situation's heavy, heavy

How am I supposed to know
Where I want my life to go
If you always hold the plan
And maybe I will learn to lead
It will be my own mistakes
That I can say that's who I am

Here's my point of view
Wouldn't wanna offend you
Wanna do the best to prove
Push your face ain't gonna lose
Deep and twisted but I refuse
Don't want advice but help to choose

I'll just walk these tracks alone
Use it as a stepping stone

[Chorus:]
Trying to face it all alone
Had to find my own way home
No matter how hard it may be
The situation's heavy
I'm not growing old before my time
Even when there's warning signs
That consequently I can see
The situation's heavy, heavy

oooh [etc]

Here's my point of view
Wouldn't wanna offend you
Wanna do the best to prove
Push your face ain't gonna lose
Deep and twisted but I refuse
Don't want advice but help to choose

I'll just walk these tracks alone
Use it as a stepping stone

[Chorus:]
Trying to face it all alone
Had to find my own way home
No matter how hard it may be
The situation's heavy
I'm not growing old before my time
Even when there's warning signs
That consequently I can see
The situation's heavy

Trying to face it all alone
Had to find my own way home
No matter how hard it may be
The situation's heavy
I'm not growing old before my time
Even when there's warning signs
That consequently I can see
The situation's heavy, heavy
