Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees, Rickki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you

Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

He said...

[Bridge:]
Why d'you cry
For the guy
Say goodbye
Runaway
Why d'you cry 
For the guy
Say goodbye
I said ok, 'cos...

[Chorus]
Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy,
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy,
Such a fool boy

Eleven hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'd kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue

Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
'cos...

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy,
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy,
Such a fool boy

I'm through with it
Over it
Not having it
Crazy sh*t
Not feeling this
Can't deal, I quit
No more, No more
I'm through with it
Not having it
This crazy sh*t
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more of it
No more, no more

Breaking off the bun
A brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go "ooh"
Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
Don't you dare turn back
Can't u see I wont take that?
I ain't crying not over you
Better for your head up like I told you

[Bridge]
Why d'you cry
For the guy
Say goodbye
Runaway
Why d'you cry 
For the guy
Say goodbye
I said ok, 'cos...

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy,
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy,
Such a fool boy (such a fool)

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy (I do)
And it's cool boy (yeah it's cool)
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy, (I do boy)
Such a fool boy (such a fool)
