Talk to strangers 
Wonder the woods in the light 
Walk the wire 
And let it so right 

Live in the face clef 
Better damager stake your life 
Push your luck or let you lie 

You be beware 
You be beware now 
You be beware 
May you feel the you need 
I recommend that you cross the street 
I there will be fire everywhere 
You don't want mess with me 

Roman darkness 
Don't waited your brawl wasting with us 
And Come winter 
Go on and trappable with lights 

Live in the face clef 
Better damager stake your life 
Push your luck or let you lie 

You be beware 
You be beware now 
You be beware 
May you feel the you need 
I recommend that you cross the street 
I there will be fire everywhere 
You don't want to mess with me 

That spark is in your I am 
It can't deny it 
It on your face 
The burn the love the danger 
No one where to save you 

You be beware 
You be beware now 
You be beware 
May you feel the you need 
I recommend that you cross the street 
I there will be fire everywhere 
You don't want to mess with me
