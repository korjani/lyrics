Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Like a light into my life
I never thought that it would feel so bright, yeah
All I wanna do is hold you tight
And I'll be with you through trouble nights

Sometimes life it drags you down
And plays you like a fool
Makes you feel so empty sometimes
It can be so cruel, ooh yeah

So follow me home
You'll never be lost
We'll weather the storm
whatever the cost
I won't walk away
I'll stand by your side
I'm here for you
The rest of our lives

When you're feeling all alone
Hear the words that I'm singing to you, oh
Like a seed that has been sown
As you grow, I will protect you, yeah, yeah

Sometimes life it drags you down
And plays you like a fool
Makes you feel so empty sometimes
It can be so cruel, ooh yeah

So follow me home
You'll never be lost
We'll weather the storm
whatever the cost
I won't walk away
I'll stand by your side
I'm here for you
The rest of our lives

Baby all I'm trying to say
Is that my heart is here to hold you
I'm never far away
Take my hand so I can feel you
I've searched and I have found
I'll never let you down
We will all stand on solid ground
(No matter what will always be around)

(So follow me home)
So follow me home
(Never be lost)
You'll never be lost
(We'll weather the storm)
We'll weather the storm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
whatever the cost
I won't walk away
(I won't walk away)
I'll stand by your side
(I'll stand by your side)
I'm here for you
(Yeah, yeah)
The rest of our lives

(So follow me home)
So follow me home
(Never be lost)
You'll never be lost
(We'll weather the storm)
We'll weather the storm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
whatever the cost
I won't walk away

The rest of our lives
