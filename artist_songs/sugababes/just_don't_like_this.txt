Look across the room
I see some guy
Steaming over me
He's smirking sleazy
Probably be older than daddy
Since you smiled
My expression has changed
Come any closer
Things will be constrained
I walk pass looking good
Doesn't give you the right
To put that hand where you think that you should

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this

I don't want any man to tell me what to do
Anyone to say to me my feelings are not true
For your information
I maintain my station
Feel so incredible
Don't need no man to tell me where yo go
Cos this is all you know

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this

I'll go wherever I know that you won't go
I don't have to tango with your ego
And it's just because I said so
They way I'm feeling now is mental
The problem first starts in your dentail
I can't believe they let you in 'dis place
But have they seen the look on your face

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this

Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
Not this girl, not this world
Just step off, had enough
You're no good, I'm no fool
I just don't need this
