[Heidi] 
I can tell you all the things you ever want to know 
I'm just waiting on a chance that you might say hello 
People always telling me to take my time 
But I can't help that you're on my mind 
Never thought that I would one day find 
Somebody like you 

[Chorus] 
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling 
Nothing's as good as you 
What is it that you make me so crazy 
I'm so in love with you 
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight 

[Amelle] 
Ain't it funny, all the money never seems enough 
Don't need no perfume or fancy dresses 
I only want your love 
So don't you ever listen to a word they say 
As long as were together we will be ok 
Never thought that I would one day find 
Somebody like you 

[Chorus] 
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling 
Nothing's as good as you 
What is it that you make me so crazy 
I'm so in love with you 
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight 

[Keisha] 
The way the you're making me feel 
So alive, so good, so real 
And I know at the end of the day 
I will never be the same 

[Chorus] 
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight 
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling 
Nothing's as good as you 
What is it that you make me so crazy 
I'm so in love with you 
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight
