Turn me over, turn me over again
Turn me over, turn me over again
Turn me over, turn me over again

Hey boy! Don't you know that you're the only one for me (oh baby)
We contemplating 'bout the times we shared
Baby never leave, oh yeah
Even though it seems to me
Your love for me is true
I don't wanna ever be
The one you make a fool

[Chorus]
Is this the real thing?
The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?

(Whatcha want?)
Baby, why don't take this message as a sign
Coz everytime I see you boy
You're blowing my mind
Let me take you higher so we almost touch the sky
Tell me I'm the only one that sparkles in your eyes

[Chorus]
Is this the real thing?
The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?

Is this the real thing?
(Sugababes, Sugababes, on the run, on the run, no doubt, no doubt)

Even though it seems to me
Your love for me is true
I don't wanna ever be
The one you make a fool
Let me take you higher so we almost touch the sky
Tell me I'm the only one that sparkles in your eyes

[Chorus]
Is this the real thing?
The once a love
My whole being
The one to give me everything
Is this the real thing?
Cannot believe its happening
Will you be truly outstanding?
Is this the real thing?

Is this the real thing?
(Sugababes, no doubt, Sugababes)

Is this the real thing?
(No doubt, Sugababes, break it down)
