[Verse 1]
I get so used to being alone 
My choice this time I'm in a zone
Not in a place where you can't control me

Not saying i don't wan't to take a chance
Coz its all open to romance
I know it's crazy but I must say

[Chorus]
It ain't easy being me
It ain't easy don't you know
Coz I'm not the type to let
someone take over me
It ain't easy 
(no)
It ain't easy
(that's for sure)
It ain't easy
(Oh oh oh ohhh)
It ain't easy
(no)
It ain't easy
(ohhh ohhh)
It ain't easy
(oh oh oh ohhh)

[Verse 2]
Wanna have you back down on your knees
Can't give you too much coz I know
Gets to the point where I can't control you

It's like a rush straight to my brain
Feels like I'm driving you insane
In every way coz I can't be contained

[Chorus]
It ain't easy being me
It ain't easy don't you know
Coz I'm not the type to let
someone take over me
It ain't easy 
(no)
It ain't easy
(that's for sure)
It ain't easy
(Oh oh oh ohhh)
It ain't easy
(no)
It ain't easy
(ohhh ohhh)
It ain't easy
(oh oh oh ohhh) [x2]

[Verse 3]
Constantly reminded of the place I used to be
Gave up so much energy but now its all about me 

Oh oh oh ohhh 
Oh oh oh ohhh
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
Oh oh oh ohhh 
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
Oh oh oh ohhh
(It ain't easy being me)
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
(It ain't easy being me)
It ain't easy
Oh oh oh ohhh
(It ain't easy being me)
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
Oh oh oh ohhh
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
Oh oh oh ohhh
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
