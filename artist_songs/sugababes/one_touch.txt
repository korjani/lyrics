Mum I found a guy that I really want
I know you say i'm young
But he don't wanna hurt me
Never has to try, special kinda guy
I get these funny feelings
Whenever he's around me

One touch of love
That was only to my dear
And i'm never gonna let you go away now

Call him what you want
Call him what you like
He's always there for me
Whenever I feel lonely
Don't know what I'll say 
Don't know what I'll do
Coz if you change your mind
Then I'll go crazy yeah

[Chorus]
One touch of love
It was only to my dear
And I'm never gonna let you go away now
So much, so much
So much I wanna have you near
And I'm never gonna let you go away now

Anytime my friends hang out with me
I can't wait to be with you again, no
And everytime you call my telephone
It's clear to me
That I can't let you go
Never let go
I can't let you go
Never let you go

That I can't let you go
Never let you go
I can't let you go
Never let you go

[Chorus]
One touch of love
It was only to my dear
And I'm never gonna let you go away now
So much, so much
So much I wanna have you near
And I'm never gonna let you go away now

[Chorus]
One touch of love
It was only to my dear (you took me dear)
And I'm never gonna let you go away now
So much, so much
So much I wanna have you near (wanna have you near)
And I'm never gonna let you go away now

One touch of love
Never gonna let you go away
Never gonna let you go away now
So much, so much
Never gonna let you go away
Never gonna let you go away now
One touch of love
Never gonna let you go away
Never gonna let you go away now
