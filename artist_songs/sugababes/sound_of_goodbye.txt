There is no easy way to break somebody's heart 
When you know what you're gonna say will leave a mark 
But I've tried, and i've tried, and i've tried 
To no end 

This is the moment that you smile before you cry 
Feels like I'm aiming for your heart, ready to fire 
Oh I wish it could be different, wish it could be different 
But it'll only hurt you more 

If I say that things can change 
I'd be leading you astray-yeah-yeah 

The stars in the sky are all burned out 
Nothing to guide us back home now 
These are the words I've kept inside 
Now this is the sound of goodbye 
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back 
Everything starts to fade to black 
How can the silence seem so loud 
And all you can hear is the sound 
Of goodbye 

I know I said that I would love you 'till I die (I die) 
That was then and this is now, that ain't no lie (no lie) 
But I can't keep on faking I'm constantly making you wait 

I don't wanna fight with you but I don't wanna fight for you 
'Cause things just don't feel the same 
Oh I wish it could be different, wish it could be different 
But it'll only hurt you more 

If I say that things can change (Hey) 
I'd be leading you astray-yeah-yeah 

The stars in the sky are all burned out 
Nothing to guide us back home now 
These are the words I've kept inside 
Now this is the sound of goodbye 
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back 
Everything starts to fade to black 
How can the silence seem so loud 
And all you can hear is the sound 
Of goodbye 

Of goodbye.. 

These words fall out my mouth and nothing feels the same 
Hey 

The stars in the sky are all burned out 
Nothing to guide us back home now 
These are the words I've kept inside 
Now this is the sound of goodbye 
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back 
Everything starts to fade to black 
How can the silence seem so loud 
And all you can hear is the sound 
Of goodbye
