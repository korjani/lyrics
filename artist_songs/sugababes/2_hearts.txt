It never seems enough baby 
When your head is full of stuff 
Then again you didnt go 
And thank god you didnt though 
Whats it gonna take baby 
For two of us to make it 
Through this one 
Can we make it through this song? 

Everything between us makes me glow 
But how could you know? 
Simple things bring simple pleasures 
That we know 
Or maybe they didnt show 

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please 
2 you 2 me 2 make totally 
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those 
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly 

Do you really wanna wait another day? 
Coz everybody needs a little time to pay 
And after when the time is up 
Everybody doesnt always get their say 
Feels like a little price to pay 
Then after we laugh it up 

Everything about us makes me grow 
But how would you know? 
Simple things bring simple pleasures 
That we know 
Baby its time to show 

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please 
2 you's 2 me's 2 make totally 
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those 
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly 

Your the must have 
Your the part im in your palm 
Love freely so really 
Theres a call 
Where's it from? 

Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh 

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please 
2 you's 2 me's 2 make totally 
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those 
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly [x2]
