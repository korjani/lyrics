Boy 1 was famous from TV 
He carved my name into a tree 
First cut's the deepest 
And I left him bleeding 

Boy 2 had earned a law degree 
He charged me with a felony 
I stole his heart and pled insanity 

I know 
Nothing lasts eternal in life 
But love hurts forever 

Boy 3 worked at the cemetery 
His crooked smile was kinda sweet 
All things must end 
Now he is 6 feet deep 

Boy 4 was filthy rich indeed 
He flew a private jet, but see 
He crashed and burned 
There's just no buying me 

I know 
Nothing lasts eternal in life 
But love hurts forever 

Every heart that's broken is a murder one 
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun 
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done 
Cause every heart that's broken 
Is a murder one 

Boy 5 composed a symphony 
Strings and choir just for me, 
Then he turned deaf 
It was a tragedy 

Boy 6 lived in a monastery 
He chose a life of poverty 
I chose Channel 
So much for chastity 

I know 
Nothing lasts eternal in life 
But love hurts forever 

Every heart that's broken is a murder one 
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun 
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done 
Cause every heart that's broken 
Is a murder one 

Every heart that's broken is a murder one 
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun 
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done 
Cause every heart that's broken 
Is a murder one 

Boy 7 was a Don of all Sicily 
He tried to kiss and tell on me so now he 
Sleeps with the fishes, arrivederci baby 

Last boy was a director on a silver screen 
He went and wrote a slasher flick just for me 
When he said cut 
I took it literally 

Every heart that's broken is a murder one 
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun 
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done 
Cause every heart that's broken 
Is a murder one 

Every heart that's broken is a murder one 
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun 
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done 
Cause every heart that's broken 
Is a murder one
