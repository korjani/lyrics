He was the one for me
He made me feel alright
Now everything's gone wrong
We where so tight
He ain't the one
So just move on
It's time that you let it go
How can I now forget him
He's the only one

[Bridge]
Don't; don't waste your time
(Don't you waste your time)
There's a good thing waiting for you down the line
(Down the line)
Don't, don't waste your time
(Don't you waste your time)
As soon as you get over him your life will truly shine
(Truly shine)

[Chorus]
Just let it go
There's a good thing waiting for you
Don't you know (Don't you know yeah)
Just let it go
As soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend, oh

"Wait, wait wait
Wait I just..."

How can I let him go
When he means so much to me
You think I'm blind
You think it's time
I can't get him off my mind
He ain't the one for you
Girl it's time him go
I think you're right
He needs to go
He is not the one for me, yeah

[Bridge]
Don't; don't waste your time
(Don't you waste your time)
There's a good thing waiting for you down the line
(Down the line)
Don't; don't waste your time
(Don't you waste your time)
As soon as you get over him your life will truly shine
(Truly shine)

[Chorus]
Just let it go (I can't let it go)
There's a good thing waiting for you
Don't you know (Don't you know oh)
Just let it go (Hard to let it go)
As soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend (Find my rainbow, yeah)

When you've found the one that's meant for you
Then you'll realise
That it's just a phase you're going through
Everybody has their bad times

[Chorus]
Just let it go
There's a good thing waiting for you
Don't you know
Just let it go (Hard to let it go)
As soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend (Find my rainbow)

[Chorus]
Just let it go (I can't let it go)
There's a good thing waiting for you
Don't you know (Don't you know)
Just let it go (Hard to let it go)
As soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend (Find my rainbow)

[Chorus]
Just let it go (I can't let it go)
There's a good thing waiting for you
Don't you know (Oh yeah, yeah)
Just let it go (Hard to let it go)
As soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend, oh

Just let it go (go)
There's a good thing waiting for you don't you know
Just let it go (go)
Soon as you get over him you'll find the sweetest friend, oh

Don't you know yeah
