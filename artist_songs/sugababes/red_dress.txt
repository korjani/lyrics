Cooler than the red dress
Cos I'm cooler
Cos I'm cooler
Cos I'm cooler than the red dress
Cos I'm cooler
Cos I'm cooler

A girl's entitled to flaunt
To get what she wants
Can't say that it's wrong
No baby
A man's not a boy can't you see
We're pulling the strings
We're taking the lead

And when you're sure
You'll never let her play you again
She'll put on your favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone, Dirty dance
Her hips will send you into a trance

Cos I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
(Give me credit)
'Cos what you see the man gets
(Don't forget it)
And if he don't I'm better off here alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now, baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
I'm giving it up now maybe
(To you)

I've played the desperate lady
Jumped through all of the hoops boy
Instead of constant craving
I leave the chasing to you
And if you don't respect it
I'll kick with my Jimmy Choos
Cos boy if you don't love me
Then I've got nothing to lose

Cos I've been down this roads before
I should have known that I was to blame
Won't put on your
Favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone, dirty dance
That's not the way I get my romance

Cos I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
Cos what you see the man gets
And if he don't I'm better off here alone

(Save your kisses)
Cos I'm cooler than the red dress
(Do you get it)
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
(Give me credit)
Cos what you see the man gets
(Don't forget it)
And if he don't I'm better off here alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
I'm giving it up now baby
Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
(Right now)
I'm giving it up now baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
(Own you, own you baby)
I'm giving it up now maybe

So don't call me baby
(Cooler than the red dress)
So don't call me baby
(Cooler than the red dress)
