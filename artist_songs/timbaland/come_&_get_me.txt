Nigga Your Time Is Up, I Aint Come To Kid You
I Knew You niggas Was Dumb, But How Dumb Is You
Thinkin You Can See The King, When You Unofficial
You Dont wanna Go To War, Cuz I'll Launch These Missiles
I'm A Ride Or Die Nigga, I Be Tearin Shit Up
We Aint Like Them Other Fools, Who Dont Compare To Us
All The Hoes Love A Nigga, They be Backing It Up
But Me I Love Money I Be Stacking It Up
When My Bandwagon Pull Up They Hop On Board
They Hop Right On Mine and Hop Right Off Yours
I Get Respect Homie All Across The Board
I Get A Quarter Mill A Track Without An Award
Ever Wanna Test A Nigga Then Come See Me
In The Street I Hold My Ground Like I'm Concrete
I Know Shit Aint Sweet so When Shit Get Deep
I'm Rich I Can Pay To Have You Six Feet Deep
(Nigga)

[Chorus]

I Give It To Whoever Want It, If You Want It Come See Me
You Know Where I'm At If You, If You Want It Come Get Me [x2]

[50 Cent]

Nigga You Violate I Regulate Rat Tat Tat
Bigger Shells They Fit In That Banana Clip Tech 
Run and A Bullseye Form on Your Back
It's Hard To Miss Wit A Full Clip In The Mac

I Got Ammo Ammo I Unload, Reload Cut A Nigga Quick
Ye My Knife Game Lethal That Tough Guy Shit
Nigga Thats What I see Through 
You Like a 3 Course Meal Motherfucker I Eat You
You Food And I'm In The Mood So Front I Let The Hammer Fly
Nigga You Can Duck, Run For Cover, Or Die
Your Choice, You Choose 
I Pop, You Move, Like You In Shock You Been Shot
Nigga.. Your Blood On The Street, You Up Ships Creek
You Can Hardly Speak, Startin To Get Weak Your Eyes Close
Your Life Flash, Your Heart Slow, Your Heart Stop,
Your Ass Dead, You Fucked Kid

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]

I'm Like Nicholas Cage Yeye Its The Ghost Rider
P89 Ye I Let My Toast Slide, Costa Rica To Brazil
I Got My Hoes In The Lamb, why Your Bitch Bald Headed
Like Britney Spears, I'm In The Projects Gettin Dope and Piff Money
2 More Flips Thats Anna Nicole Smith Money, Fuck A G4
I'm In a G 500, G 450, G550, Thats Airplane Talk
I'm The Aviator Man Baby AR Shoot Your Baby Out Your Hands
Spaghetti And Corn Bread, Mix Got Me Blunted,
There's No Talk Abouts.. You Dont Fuck On An Empty Stomach
By Out The Mall, Then Hug The Block, Hundred Thou Wood Grain
In A Phantom Drop, Then I Cruise In The Club 
Got My Ruge In The Club, Pay A Bouncer A Buck
Now My Uz In The Club, Ye Nigga

[Chorus]
