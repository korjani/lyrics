Baby let me come and scoop you in the Benz 
We can chill and lay back while I drop my top baby if you want you can bring a friend 
I get it poppin' off 
Be glad you got involved 
Girl if you play your position then all your problems solved 
They show me love in every hood and every city I go 
They say "Timbo you the best" and I say baby "I know" 
Two-tone Maybach when I slide up in it when I go my ride is tinted 
Gotta pull the shades back and tell her "Hello" 
She wanna chill wit a nigga 
We can smoke we can drink just keep it real wit a nigga 
I got a plan shawty go getcha man shawty 
Let me put it simple so you can understand shawty cause

Smooth with the flow get you where you goin' 
You already know and if you don't then I'ma show 
Look how I does that they lookin' at you they lookin' at me they be like "what's that?" 
Tryin' to get they buzz back 
I got places to go and a whole lotta things to see (I guarantee) 
And I'ma be right here until ya'll done got enough of me 
Steady on my grind tryin' to get it 
Money on my mind, is you with it? 
Tryin' to hold me down cause of that ego now they ain't around, but look at me
