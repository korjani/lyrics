[Twista]
Who am I, Nigga wid tha blunt, steady trippin, sippin on the concoction,
with tha gun cocktin
Drum knockin, gotta get off
Bitches and killas in the front watchin
Flowin with like a finna studda some
Betta come off a butta ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
Ima flow until my belly hurt
Pimp nigga rockin on tha stage an rock on in the petty shirt
Let it ruff, ooh
Feels like anotha one
Who you be? Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The muthafucka most likely
To get a tuba with the opposition in my position 
I break em off when I give em tha heat
Steady re' for rollin
Bullets body decomposion
I dismember the weak on the Timbaland beat
You remember the beat
Conversation we had
When my adrinallin was rushin
Check yo brakes and knee pads
When the twis to get tha bus in
Bodys gon' get rushed in
I can make em hit tha dance flo
Brothas, bitches, and hustlers
I get up in the guts homie, never phoney
Hitta wigga when he run up on me
Yall muthafuckas still don't know me
Let em' learn slowly

[Chorus:2x]
Who you be?
Im tha one that stay high
Center maka up tha party, rockin bodys
with tha thugga hands up in the sky
neva shy he's fly
Who am i, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck
T-straight from the Chi
Ribal, homosydal, everybody duck
With tha party up and pimp struck
T-N-T now I say who am I

Who you be? Who am I?
The one who's surrounded by the wood
500 wid the ribs stickin through the hood
Up to no good thats why'd stay they misunderstood
And Im always in tha mix of some shits
Scoop a shawty an she thick
And tha bitch getts grip in them hips
Putta dick on tha lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal
So I tricked on that bitch
Now who you be?
The one who's on tha dance floor
Sex gon be one of tha mass hoes
Freak on a bad hoe
you's could really wanna flash gold
Turn a hater to a sass hoe
Play an ballin up at Cape Town, strippin went down
Study, tippin off of CDs an Tapes
Though see niggas see Gs to take
Run up to tha car, got no thangs
They got CDs to break, no easy pace
Who you be?
The crime cause other obituary an uligy
Photo stank and yall be who to see
Only smokin it wid you and me
Lets go hang out where tha booty be
I was on sumthin, no frontin
Yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin
Grinnin while up in the curb
Wanna journey for herb
Always tellin somebody to smoke somethin
True indeed

[Chorus 2x]

The one thats flowin fluently
Make yo baby say goo to me
Whatcha did to her
Didn't ask why I hit her for
Cause the game like liturature
Get it Get it gurl
I don't know what you was waitin on
But if you aint wid a partna
This young monsters a fly guy
Shake a lil bit of dat body
We gon party till we sky high
To my playas an soldiers, shady niggas, young thugs and strap hoes,
pimps strikin fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs an MC's for the rifols
The one that be kickin off air time
From sunrise ta bedtime
All of yall need ta know me, the one an only
Pimp slach tingin twista from tha Chi
Makin compotition die slowly
Who am I?

[Chorus 2x]

[Timbaland]
Ha ha ha ha

For tha 98 or TNT 
Thang ya know what Im sayin
