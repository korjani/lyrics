[Intro - Young Thug:]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
Slime mob

[Chorus - Young Thug:]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil bitch
He swear all he want, but he didn't do it
He acting like it, but he didn't do it
He couldn't do it
Didn't do it, he didn't
No he didn't do it
All caps... he ain't do it

[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]
Bitch you didn't do it
Boy you didn't do it, you didn't do it
Bitch I was slime
I sleep in your woods like tigers, just do it
I'm smokinG on trees
My step is a stomp and my feet on that wood
I am on fire
This ice cools me down so don't play with no fluid
Whip out the bankroll and buy the stilettos
She not gon do this shit unless I say so
Been a hustler, never been in one, nigga, got dough
He should've known
Put Act on my Eggo then syrup, no Karo
We really rich, nigga, pour 4s in a Faygo
And it's fake though
If she wanna fuck on my bitch, she's a dyke hoe
That right though
Cause since our sentences, we don't do Geico
Alright hoe? Sign your life away for a little play

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Young Thug:]
I know your worth
You know my work, I go berserk
If she ain't worth
Fuck it, nigga, still buy the lil purse, cash!
I see you balling
You do it small... Nerf
I throw them bands
Later on best believe she gon slurp
Chicken pox, gators look like they got chicken pox
I can't flop cause I'm higher than an angel was
Bend her back, eat it, then perform that ankle lock
Niggas can't get the bitch, the girl, they know they crop
First I'm gunning then I started running
She flooded me with pussy then I started cumming
No game, I made that pussy nigga run like Sonny, take off
When he looked at Pablo Esco then I thought bought bumming

[Chorus]
