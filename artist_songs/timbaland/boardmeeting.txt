Clap ya hands everybody, if you got what it takes
I'm timbo and I want you to know that these are the brakes

Uh-huh, uh-huh

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey, get ya back up off the wall
Uh-huh, uh-huh 
Hey, get ya back up off the wall

Let me tell ya
You got me feining for your body parts
You said you lonely and you need it bad
Come and see me when you wanna to start
And where we going you don't have to ask

[Chorus:]
Come in my sight? with the blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting

I know a quiet place where we can talk
Girl, relax and let me do my thing
Baby I don't wanna to break your heart
I just want to make you say my name

[Chorus:]
Come in my sight? with the blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting

In the back of my mind, girl you infidel
Even though you a skunk?, I'm a fan of chest
Role play you the best, you supply the sex
Yes, I'm a fein of your hole
One hit of you, when I lose control
I look in your eyes, I can see yo soul
Bankroll in the hole for you to cause and go

[Chorus:]
Come in my sight? with the blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Get ya back up off the wall
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey! Get ya back up off the wall
