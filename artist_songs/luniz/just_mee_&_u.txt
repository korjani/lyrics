Nummy-Num playboy
I remember when we was hella broke dude
We just had a dream right?
We made it happen dude

[Chorus:]
Jus me and you
We made it, went from broke to havin' thangs
Jus me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game
Jus me and you
We made it, went from broke to havin' change
Jus me and you
Ohh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry bout a damn thang

[Numskull:]
We used to be short on the avenue so broke 
on the avenue I couldn't afford to have a brew
how it happened dude just me and you
I use to drink brew after you
you had your daughter first my baby son was born right after you
now we making cash with Dru
oh look what havin' cash would do
playahatas come after you 
if they blast at you 
i'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do
one ain't better than havin' two
looney individuals off cash and brew
lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
hindu drinkin glass with you, cheers
we lasted through years what we have to do
we finally here, I got 5 showed on the billboard live
doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of jive
front page of the Vibe, live and direct, 
Rafael Saadiq freak that beat chorus and drumset
make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next
with pavey rolex
just me and you

[Chorus]

[Yukmouth:]
We risked it and killed in cali before we make bread
creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
now turn money and keepin moms happy got me gladly livin lavelle
I say we blessed to have mail
big willie, I'm numb to the world baby
don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
you never see yuckmouth weighin circumstances
you never see numbskull flossin takin chances
advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
and it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit
believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe 
that in america I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck 
it was all dreams and wishes, game and luck
Just me and you

[Chorus]

It was gonna happen man
First we got 5 on it
Now we got 5 on big beats
Rafael Saadiq, DJ Quik, G 1
That's how it happened man
Once you get large do your thang
Big thangs man

[Numskull:]
Hey when you saw my show in '94 
you didn't know we'd blow like Nitroclycerin
Girbaud, Tommy Hill, Timberland
Playboy I use to rock a pendelton, offecer arrests a gentleman
now I'm spending big deusch marks on German women
in the red light district way out in Amsterdam kickin it
Adam and Eve coffee shop purchase grams wicked
disappeared like the grand wizard dig it
trying to be the richest young black brothas in the business

[Yukmouth:]
I heard so many times it was hopeless, bogus
accordin to both of us the world was untouched we had to focus
I had to explain thangs to the fullest
figured out what we could and couldn't
and made plans to get the puddin'
there's too many rules to made and broke
the mail is to be made so lets fade a toast
now tell these folks to let me be all I can be
so the L-U-N-I-Z will go down is history

[Chorus]
