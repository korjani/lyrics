There's no sign on the gate
and there's mud on your face
don't ya think it's time we re-investigate this stuation
put some fruit on your plate
you forgotten how it started
close your eyes
think of all the bubbles of love we made
and you're down on your knee
it's too late
oh don't come crawlin'
and you lie by my feet
what a big mistake
I see you fallin'

gotta buz in my head
and my flowers are dead
can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
don't believe what you said
you forgotten how it started
close your eyes
think of all the bubbles of love we made
and you're down on your knees
it's too late
oh don't come crawlin'
and you lie by my feet
what a big mistake
I see you fallin'

I could sting like a bee
careful how you treat me
baby I don't think l'll accept, your sorry invitation
close the door as you leave
and you cry over me
I can't wait
I feel you stallin'
and you try to reach me
what a big mistake
I hear you callin'
[chorus]
