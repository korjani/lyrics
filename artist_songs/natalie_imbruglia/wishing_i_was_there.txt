Take your hand
and place it in my pocket
flick your eyes back in my sockets
put those thoughts away
sometimes they're much too loud
I'll take a breath
and cradle your sweet head
should've stayed at home in bed
put that face away
I'm melting for you
I know, I get cold
cos  I cant leave things well alone
understand I'm accident prone
me, I get free
every night the morn is mine
but when the morning comes
don't say  you love me
don't say you need me
I really don't think that's fair
boy I'm not so dumb
but when you leave me
I'll be wishing I, wishing I,  wishing I was there

I dreamt
about another girl in bed with you
you just laughed and smiled
denied the proof
we're fine till I think of a problem
I wish it made sense
like a joke that no one gets
it's alive without regret
I want to feel that way, forever and ever
[chorus]
