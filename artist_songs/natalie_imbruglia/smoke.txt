My lullaby, hung out to dry
what's up with that
it's over
where are you dad
mums' looking sad
what's up with that
it's dark in here
why bleeding is breathing
you're hiding, underneath the smoke in the room
try, bleeding is believing
I used to

my mouth is dry
forgot how to cry
what's up with that
you're hurting me
I'm running fast
can't hide the past
what's up with that
you're pushing me
why, bleeding is breathing
you're hiding, underneath the smoke in the room
try, bleeding is believing
I used to

why, believing is breathing
you're hiding, underneath the smoke in the room
try, bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling on the floor
why, bleeding is believing
you're hiding, underneath the smoke in the room
why bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling to the door
why, bleeding is believing
you're hiding, underneath the smoke in the room
try, bleeding is believing
I saw you falling on the floor
