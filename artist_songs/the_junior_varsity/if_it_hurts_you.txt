Tick tock the clock of time and beauty
Mid-life crisis is crawling towards you
Consult your friends adults and kids
Hear out what they have to tell you
Even if it hurts you
Even if it kills you

Beep beep the cars already running
I'm running late
I've always want to be right on time
Writeing everyone of you off
I just had to tell you
Even if it hurts me
Even if it kills me
If i dont let them touch me 
How will they defeat me?

I'd love to know 
What you were thinking about
With that thorn in your in foot
You should have pulled it out
And once the idea set in
Could you handle it?

And once the idea set in
Could you handle it?

I brought the bad news
Could you take it from me
Coming from me
And even though it left my head
The thought of passing sleep is 
Too much to handle
