She's too complex
Then we sex
Open legs
To the vein
I complain
Sniff cocaine
Harder back, heart attack
Smack to my vein
Smash down the walls
Smash down the walls
She crazy claws
She crazy claws

Imagine that
Who that?
I'll soon forget
She wants to fly
She wants to cry
She wants to fly
Makes me wanna die
She'll mix emotion
She's an ocean
She's still alive
She's still alive

Don't forget
Don't regret
Don't see me now
Don't see me then
See me now
Come see again
Don't see me now
Don't see me then

She's too complex
Then we sex
Open legs, open legs
She see my vein
I complain
And sniff cocaine
And sniff cocaine
Hard back, hard attack
Smack to my vein
Smack to my vein
Smash down the walls
Smash down the walls
She crazy claws
She crazy claws

Imagine that
Who that crazy cat?
Imagine that
Who that?
I'll soon forget
She wants to fly
She wants to cry
Makes me wanna, wanna die
She'll mix emotion
Like she's an ocean
She's still alive
Just don't forget
(She's still alive)

Don't regret
Don't see me now
(Crazy cat)
Don't see me now
Don't see me then
(Yeah)
Don't see me now
Don't see me then
(Yeah)

She's too Gen-X
Then we flex
She's too Gen-X
Then we sex
She's too Gen-X
Then we sex
Imagine that
I will soon forget
Sniff cocaine
I complain

Try to pick a fight with my chick
'Cause she might put a fine stick right quick
Fought city girls then we tried shit
Then it's off to Chanel's, hit nice Brits
The babes with the skinny waist and wide hips
Ain't just a pretty face with nice tits
She's on to me left well alone
What a pace, Scarface to get the telephone
From the mouth to the right ear
Then she might yell with her
I see her and boy take off the mic and
In my world the babes are quite rare
Me and my girl would make a nice pair
She ain't slow when it's time to make go
Like fake 'ho frontin' on the main road
My blue-billed girl that takes the payroll
With the crew, with their dirty faces and halos
Stay low- trying to sell that snow
My bitch so hot they call her El Paso
See the slap I flop with that though
Or the little black 'ho
I'm pattin' my afro
I'm jokin' but you know how that go
She likes to be in full control like Castro
I stay high so I don't get low
You know this flows from out the ghetto
Scrape up the knees, scrape the elbows
Before I breeze I make the girl know
Scrape up the knees, scrape the elbows
Before I breeze I make the girl know

Girl is skinny now and shaking her breasts
Don't be a loudmouth make your bread
Diamonds is a girl's best friend
Diamonds is forever-yes/no
Here in the bed we have
Don't be screwing a girl in the Lexus
You make room
Cash their jarole
Before they try lickin' her out on the down low
She don't open- no
But a nigga tries suits
She ready forgot the kind of go for the Sambo
Reloads the ammo
One for the go
Let's laugh as they at you
She's her mother's daughter
Ready to slaughter any punk
Who puts his hands in her garter
A weed see?
She deadly and she do anything for me
Niggas better cash their jarole
Before they try chatting to the girl I know
She called, you know the flow
When she used her hand
To rub it down low for your dough
She ain't a 'ho
She's scandalous
Messed up all and your in an ambulance
She's her mother's daughter
Ready to slaughter any punk
Who puts his hands in her garter
A weed see?
She deadly and she do anything for me
