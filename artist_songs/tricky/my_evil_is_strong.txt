Well, I see it so much
I see it so much
I see it

Before you test, know what's going on
I've been around for long, my evil is strong
I lie awake and hate you
Maybe that's strong enough to make you

Before you test, know what's going on
I've been around for long, my evil is strong
I lie awake and hate you
Maybe that's strong enough to make you

Something happened, a car crash
Make you play with a weapon
A gun in your mouth, my voice in your mind

Before you test, know what's going on
I've been around for long, my evil is strong
I lie awake and hate you
Maybe that's enough to make you

Something happened, a car crash
Make you play with a weapon
A gun in your mouth, my voice in your mind

Sleep and I'll find you
Put my mind to, am I strong enough?
Watch me rock a thousand stage

My funny valentine, I don't find you funny
Seaside, the sunny, the fame, the money
Who am I to say, so do you wanna be a?
No, I can't say it, my mouth is like a

Bittersweet and twisted, deceitful, rough and gifted
Even got God scared, even got God scared
Mending things we did, making children
Strong enough to take a life
Are you strong enough to take care of one?

I'm a work on it, pray on it, stay on it
I'm a work on it, pray on it and stay in it
I'm a work on it, pray on it and stay in it

Before you test, know what's going on
I've been around for long, my evil is strong
I lie awake and hate you
Maybe that's enough to make you

Something happened, a car crash
Make you play with a weapon
A gun in your mouth, my voice in your mind

Sleep and I'll find you
Put my mind to, am I strong enough?
Watch me rock a fifty thousand stage
Cannot tell me, do you feel it?
Is this energy strong enough to work you like a blade?

I'm a work on it, pray on it, stay on it
I'm a work on it, pray on it and stay in it

My funny valentine, I don't find you funny
Seaside, the sunny, the fame, the money
Who am I to say, do you wanna be a?
No, I can't say it, my mouth is like a

Bittersweet and twisted, deceitful, rough and gifted
Even got God scared, mending the things we do
Making children strong enough to take a life
Are you strong enough to look after one?

I'm a work on it, pray on it, stay in it
I'm a work on it, I'm work on it
Pray on it and stay in it

My funny valentine, I don't find you funny
Seaside, the sunny, the fame, the money
Who am I to say, do you wanna be a?
No, I can't say it, my mouth is like a

Bittersweet and twisted, deceitful, rough and gifted
Even got God scared, even got God scared
Even God's, God's scared
Mend the things we do
Making children strong enough to take a life
But are you strong enough to take care of one?

I'm a pray on it, stay in it, stay on it
I'm a work on it, pray on it, stay in it
I'm a work on it, pray on it, stay in it
