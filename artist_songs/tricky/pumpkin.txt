Pumpkin
You're hollow within
More how I'm to slowly
Let their harm
Give us some
Sad until
Like flowers untamed
Shine out ends
I find what'll make him

Love me
Life is our find
Hollow he

I can't breathe
And I can't see
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
You go your way and I'll see mine
Feels like wasted time
And it feels like I must be blind
How'd you like yourself?
You don't know yourself

To a hollow kind, don't mind
Love is some of you
Dabble in fall of failure
How, how bad

I smell of she
And I fail to be
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway

See how high
Go on

I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway
