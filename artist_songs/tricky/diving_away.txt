Here I lay waiting
For the bubbles to settle
I'm going down low
Where your sleep meets your mental
Two tries at killing me
They couldn't do it
I ran down the road
With no shoes and no jacket

Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away

I know young boys
They all want to be bad
Don't think it's madder
To be a genius
Give me a lover
That won't give me troubles
Some sexy dreams
To chew on these bubbles

Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away

Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away

Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away
