I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil
So they juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in Stussy

Hell is 'round the corner where I shelter
Isms and schisms
We're living helter skelter
If you believe or deceive
Common sense says you shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk, do you walk to your preference
No need to answer 'til
I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbour, I trudge
So judge me for my labour
Lobotomy ensures my good behavior
The constant struggle ensures my insanity
Passing the evenings ensures the struggle for my family
We're hungry, beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight
The kill which I share with my passengers
We take our fill, take our fill, take our fill

I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil
So they juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in Stussy

Confused by different memories
Details of Asian remedies
Conversations
Of what's become of enemies
My brain thinks bomb-like
So I listen he's a calm type
As I grow
And as I grow, I grow collective
Before the move sit on the perspective
Mr. cradle in the crevice
And watches from the precipice
Imperial passage
Heat from the sun somedays slowly passes
Until then, you have to live with yourself
Until then, you have to live with yourself

I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil
So they juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in Stussy

Hell is 'round the corner where I shelter
Isms and schisms
We're living helter skelter
If you believe and deceive
Your common sense says you will receive
Let me take you down the corridors

My brain thinks bomb-like
Bomb-like
My brain thinks bomb-like, bomb-like, bomb-like
My brain thinks
Bomb-like
Beware of our appetite
