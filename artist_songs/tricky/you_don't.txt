I fight evil with evil
I fight evil with evil
Believe me how you found me
Take away my self-esteem
Anytime you're ready

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try

I sleep, but get no rest
You scheme, but gods know best
Second trying, I was actually dying
When you drown in your devil's music
I did every need to use it

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try

Trust you if you're trustful
Use you if you're useful
Rarely smooth, rarely evil
And if you're here, and where is the reason?

Giant strides, twelve tribes
It takes a second to wreck it
Sixty seconds, forget it
I guess you don't hear me though

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try

I guess you don't hear me though
I'm not looking yours
I'm looking mine
Looking
So quiet but discreet
Echoes to see
On an unsuggested stream
Unsuggested mean
Take it to the top
Unstable the times
Unstable the walk
Unbearable, searable, popular demand
From cradle to grave
Is Abel buried a man
With my moneys and the felons
We conquer a clearance
Building extensions of potential
But I guess you don't hear me though

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
Even wanna try

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try

You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
Even wanna try

You don't, you don't
You don't, you don't
You don't, you, you don't
You don't wanna even try
