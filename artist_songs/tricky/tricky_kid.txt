That one fronts
Braggin' on the stunts
Coke in ya nose
Knock out ya gold fronts

That one fronts
Braggin' on your stunts
Coke in ya nose
Knock out ya gold fronts

Here comes a Nazarene
Look good in that magazine
Haile Selassie I
They look after I

God will receive us
Got me like Jesus
God will receive us
Got me like Jesus

Mary Magdalene
That'd be my first sin
Being with this temptress

It's a mongrel rage
It's a new age
As long as you're humble
Let you be the king of jungle

We run everything
Always and ever
Has been, has been

Heard there's German-Jamaicans
With twisted faces
Same in it as ever was
Tell me what the race is

It's surreal
They're not real
I put them on their places

They used to call me Tricky Kid
I live the life they wish they did
I live the life, don't own a car
And now they call me superstar

They used to call me Tricky Kid
I live the life they wish they did
I live the life, don't own a car
And now they call me superstar

Are you disturbed? I'll be with
Everybody wants to know where my mind is
I'll tell you everything, tell your life
Look deep into my mongrel eyes

(Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see
When you look into these mongrel eyes)
