I can picture it now, you in your car
Left the bar, playing Big Part
Keep up complainin'
It's probably rainin'
Keeping complaining
It's probably raining

You're gonna visit your car
[?]
It's one of my peeps
With a blow to your head
Is that what you needed?
You're probably bleeding
Is that what you needed?
You're probably bleeding

Just like a movie
Just like a movie
Just like a movie
Life doesn't move me
Life doesn't move me

I can picture it now, you in your car
Left the bar, playing the Big Part
Keeping complaining
It's probably raining
It's one of my peeps
With a blow to your head
Is that what you needed?
What you needed
What you needed
You caught me breathing

It's just like a movie
Life's just like a movie
It's like a movie
Just like a movie
It doesn't move me
Move me
Move me
It doesn't move me
Life doesn't move
It doesn't move me
Move me

It's like a blow to the head
It's like a blow to my head
It doesn't move me
Move me
Move me
Move me
It doesn't move me
It's like a movie
Just like a movie

Blow to the head
Life's like a blow to the head
What you needed
What you needed
What you needed
You're probably bleeding

Life's like a blow to the head
Is that what you needed?
What you needed
Is that what you needed?
You need a blow to the head

Move me
Move me
It doesn't move me
It's like a movie
Just like a movie
Move me
Move me
Just like a movie
It doesn't move me
It's like a movie
