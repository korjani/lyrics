Six minutes, I'm on
Six minutes, I'm on

It's a long way from Knowle West to Hollywood
I've never seen a triple beam
From LA to NY
I eat pork, make 'em scream
Six minutes, I'm on
I'm premenstrual
I bleed because I'm not a vegetable
I'm on
Six minutes, I'm on
Lies don't suit me
I think it's my duty to say I don't like guns
And in them comes spoil
The rude boys funds
I'm resilian
I don't just wanna make a million
And if the radio shows, throw low blows
We do this with or without the airplay
Like a cycle forget about Michael
Like a cycle forget about Michael
[?]

I'm gonna take this time out for a promotional click
Durban Poison artist are the smartest
In this industry full of vomit
My voodoo make 'em sick
My voodoo make 'em sick
My voodoo make 'em sick

Now when people got a good thing
They want to make it a bigger thing
Bulletproof from the truth
Now it's gone to far
And all the tough guys are dropping like flies
Like old styles and riches and those industry bitches
I heard they're taking over the benches
To be high paid wenches
Forget the champaign at the bar
You need A&R
Is this making music or money?
I can't make my mind up
They think they're safe 'cause they're signed up
You're under contracts that brakes those backs
You brag and boast, now, look-a-here
I'm controlling my destiny, I control my career
Now when people got a good thing
They want to make it a bigger thing
Bulletproof from the truth
Now it's gone to far

And all the tough guys are dropping like flies
Like old styles and riches and those industry bitches
I hear they're taking over the benches
To be high paid wenches
