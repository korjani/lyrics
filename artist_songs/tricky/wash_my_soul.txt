Wash my soul
Wash my soul
Wash my soul

I get paid while they starve in the streets
Visa cards, VIP
Wash away and use you as fan
Starving these children and I change the channel

You know me, I'm Mr. Nice
You know me, I survive at any price
So it seems I'm the devil's son

Lick it, wet it
You like it, you let it
Lick it, wet it
Touch it, take your turn
On some day, together, we can learn
Wash my soul
Wash my soul
Wash my soul

Lick it, wet it
You like it, you let it
Lick it, wet it
Touch it, take your turn
On some day, together, we can learn

I've served with gangsters and I've served with kings
These are a few of my favourite things
Think about love, love now and then
It's no good, I am weak, I admit

Wash my soul

Lick it, wet it
You like it, you let it
Lick it, wet it
Touch it, take your turn
On some day, together, we can learn
Wash my soul
Wash my soul

Lick it, wet it
You like it, you let it
Lick it, wet it
You like it, take your turn

Take your turn
Take your turn
Together, we can learn
