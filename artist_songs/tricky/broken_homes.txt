Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes

Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
We lose our voice more each year
Maybe we won't breathe soon

Is there cancer in the throat, no stress
Maybe it's supposed to kill the success?
Because success needs killing
Murder is media

Forced laugh, forged autograph
First my body, now my corpse
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes

Life is pain, murder is fame
And if you're famous you might get acquitted
If you did it

There's nowhere to run away
Damn you, I hope you pay
And finish the day-to-day
The games we play

Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
I'm-a stay at home
And talk on the telephone

'Cause nothing in this world I want from you
Don't fool yourself, I won't cry
Too scared to live
Too quick to die

Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes

Don't know how to build stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Don't know how to build stable homes

Stable Homes
Those men will break your bones
Stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Stable homes
