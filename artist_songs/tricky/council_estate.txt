In my mother's belly and I'm starting to kick
9 months in the womb and I'm making her sick
Squeeze through the womb and I land in the room
Don't know who we are, can't really tell

We do the council flats and we do some jail
We don't like school, in a week we go once
Don't like the police 'cause they kick and they punch
God bless all the stress and the stress comes at once

But remember, boy, you're a superstar

Can't break it, can't take who you are
Can't break it, can't take who you are
Remember, boy, you're a superstar

They call you council estate, they call you 'can't go straight'
They call you crime rate, they call you 'can't go straight'
And you're bending all the rules where you bury your tools
Bending all the rules where you bury your tools

Your family can't visit 'cause the visit's too far
You can't be who you be 'cause you know who you are

Remember, boy, you're a superstar
Remember, boy, you're a superstar
Remember, boy, you're a superstar

Can't break it, can't take who you are
Can't break it, can't take who you are
Remember, boy, you're a superstar

You're a superstar
Can't break it
Remember, boy, you're a superstar

Can't break it, can't take who you are
Can't break it, can't take who you are
Remember, boy, you're a superstar

Can't break it, can't take who you are
Can't break it, can't take who you are
Remember, boy, you're a superstar
