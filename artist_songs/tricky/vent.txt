She's the one
Makes me feel these ways
He's the one
Needs some raise

Can't stand to feel
Hate to feel
Gone insane
Hijack a plane

Don't push me
'Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying hard
Not to lose my head

Can hardly breathe
I've been received
She hides my
Ventolin

Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe

I'm the one
Who hides his medicine
Watch him stop breathing
Watch him bleed

I right the wrongs
And take his songs
And we'll all live
Happily ever after

Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
And we all seem together now

Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
Can hardly breathe
