What you gonna do with your sex drive?
Wait for your soul to catch up with me
Concretely seen
I talk to him
I want to lie
She looks at me
I want to hide
Want to be rich and fat
How do I validate that?
I think every time to fluid
I cut my mouth

Do I, returning into there
Can I rest my head on your chest and dribble
You know the rules I speaks in riddle
Pain is somewhere along the line
Pain is somewhere along the line

It takes courage and strength to be single
When you get older your body won't look so good
This is the peak, the best time for a relationship
I'm the only sheik in Moscow
I said if you're in love let go my hand now
The older I get the more confused I am
The older I get the more bitter I am

Damn it Jesus
They want more more pleasure more Reggis
I sway one way with my head down
I don't want to get a conflicting mind state
You hold the national wealth
I get the, I get the national health
You told me I was the original guttersnipe
But really I'm the original Israelite
I live in a ghetto forever after
So you manufacture the ghetto blaster
But I'm out now, I'm older
Don't carry music on my shoulder
You think I'm a wild terrier
Now I can afford to live in your area

The older I get the more confused I am
The confused I am the older I get
