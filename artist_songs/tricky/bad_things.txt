Choose me if
I wish I didn't feel
I wanna do bad things
And then we're one again

I wanna do bad in those movies
They say squeeze, never pull it
Muscles wrap around the bullet
And you say you be brought into it

Okay, let me make a phone call
I'd rather you float down the river-sea
Voodoo heathen, for fucking around with my privacy

I wish I didn't feel
I wanna do bad things
And then we're one again
And then we're one again

And then we're one again
And then we're one again

I wanna do bad things in the movies
They never squeeze, never pull it
Muscles wrap around the bullet
And you say you be brought into it

Get at me, make a phone call
I'd rather you float down that river-sea
Voodoo heathen, for fucking around with my privacy
Would you like to see me a for real winner?
I'd probably buy a brother dinner
I'd rather speak another language
I know she's my toasted sandwich
Be careful of food
She's egotistical and rude
And it's all about me
And it's all about me

My fucking name
I'm the one again
It's you to say I'm nice
Don't wanna ask twice

Wanna break those chains
Make the whole world know
Wanna break those chains
Make the whole world know my fucking name

I'm gonna break those chains
They don't wanna know my fucking name
And I'm born again
Want you to say I'm nice
Don't wanna ask twice
Wanna give the poor the riches
Why don't you stop saying bitches?
Wanna be good
Wanna be a homeboy from the hood
Pretend I'm from America
Pretend this is Blues, chief of the Cherokee

Wanna break those chains
Make the whole world know my fucking name
And I'm one again
And, and I'm one again
Want you to say I'm nice
Don't wanna ask twice
Wanna Give the poor the riches
I'll never just stop saying bitches
Wanna be good
Wanna be a homeboy from the hood
Pretend I'm from America
Pretend this is Blues, chief of the Cherokee
Chief of the Cherokee
Chief of the Cherokee

I wish I didn't feel
I wanna do bad things
I wish I didn't feel
I wanna do bad things

And then we're one again
And then we're one again
And we're one again
And we're one again

I wanna do bad in those movies
They say squeeze, never pull it
Muscles, muscles wrap around the bullet
And you say you be brought into it
