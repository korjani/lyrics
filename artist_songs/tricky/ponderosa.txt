The place where

Where I stand

The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino

The mind's a crowd
Search for the spaces
Turn around time's gone
I take ten paces
Been up ahead
Can't make head or tail of it
I drink till I'm drunk
And I smoke 'til I'm senseless

See in black and white
Feel in slow motion
I drown myself in sorrow
Until I wake up tomorrow
The illusion of confusion
It's not from where I am sat
Recircle, recycle, resemble me
Different levels of the devil's company

They lead us outside
Take us out quietly
To the cage through the bars
You see scars, results of my rage

The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino

The mind's a crowd (the illusion of confusion)
Search for the spaces (search for the)
Turn around time's gone (turn around, gone)
I take ten paces (I take ten paces)
Been up ahead
Can't make head or tail of it (can't make head or tail of it)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (I smoke)
And I smoke 'til I'm senseless (I smoke, I smoke)

See in black and white
Feel in slow motion (feel in slow motion, and drown, drown myself in sorrow)
Drown myself in sorrow (till I wake up tomorrow)
Until I wake up tomorrow (the illusion of)
I drown myself in sorrow (the illusion of)
Until I wake up tomorrow (the illusion of, the illusion of)
I drown myself in (the illusion of))
I drown myself in (until I, until I wake up tomorrow)
The illusion of confusion
Is not from where I am sat (is not from where I'm circle)
