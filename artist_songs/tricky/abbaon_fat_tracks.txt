Fuck you in
Tuck you in
Suck you in

"Then you fly, fly as fast as you can to Baby Jesus" 

I am she
Mistakes of men
Gritty teeth
Fists all clenched
And breast stroke
Lots of touching
See you in the sauna
There'll be big fun up
At my hotel, motel
Hotel, motel

I fuck you in the ass
Just for a laugh
With the quick speed
I'll make your nose bleed
I ride the pre-menstrual cycle
Forget about Michael
Now here's the big blast
I like the big catch
I'll spray you straight through
I spray your daydreams

Enjoy myself
Within myself
And back again
Encouraging sin
A powerful mind
Devious mind for a devious kind
Ugly noises and strange ways
By the two praise

I roll up the blue bills
I snort the cheap thrills
