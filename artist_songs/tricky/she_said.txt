She said
She said
She said
She said

She said she could tempt me
Both in rooms, full or empty
She said, she said

Even might
Turn out the lights
She said, she said

Pretend to know me
Then show me
She said, she said

She was a missed good night, I
Wanted to share her vagina
She said, she said

Then we jumped in her car
Went real far
After the pizza
With Wendy and Lisa
She said, she said

Asked about prince
I left my fingerprints
She said, she said

Then I jumped in the car
Got real far
Jumped in the car
Got real far
She said, she said

Now I start fucking with drugs
I got muggs
She said, she said

Then we jumped in the car
Got real far
She was just showin' me tanks
Robbin' banks
A new inflation
Bring migration
If you wanna be boy
Don't send a decoy
She said, she said

Wait 'til dark comes
Don't play with guns
And kill the toys
Don't play with boys
She said, she said

Let's go stress
Then touch my breasts
It's all yours
We finish tours
She said, she said

Then we jumped in the car
Went real far
Jumped in the car
Went real far
She said, she said

Now I'm on the run
Always weighs a ton
She said, she said

Dark brown eyes
You wanna stroll with eyes
She said, she said

Takes lots of patience
Then I lost my patience
Acting like an actress
Killed her on the mattress
She's dead, she's dead
She's dead, she's dead

Then I jumped in my car
Went real far
Jumped in my car
Went real far
Jumped in my car
Went real far
She's dead, she's dead
