I think about you every single day
And every time I see your face, I wake
And it brings me to tears
We hadn't spoken in years

We were close when we were young and naive
We grew up and we learned other things
You'll always be sweet 16

And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts, will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear why heaven called your name

I miss you, and it still feels like I know you
I've got pictures of us side by side to show you
But it feels like I owe you so much more 

And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts, will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear why heaven called your name

And it just doesn't seem right, was it really your time?
Are we dreaming?
We'll never let go of you
Wish you were here, but it's becoming clear
That Earth's just not the place for an angel like you

For an angel like you

You meant so much to so many
I'm not quite sure how to do justice to you
if they're ready to say goodbye
I know I'm not

You made the news and the paper for days and days
But it hardly seems fair
The whole world should know your name
I want them to know your name

And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts, will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear why heaven called your name

And it just doesn't seem right, was it really your time?
Are we dreaming?
We'll never let go of you
Wish you were here, but it's becoming clear
That Earth's just not the place for an angel like you

And now we, must let you move forward
Our love lies with you
Our souls fly with you, Amelia
