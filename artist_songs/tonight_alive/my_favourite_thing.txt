(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I fall at the thought
Of us falling apart
But I swore never to use my head,
Before I use my heart

And then you'll keep me breathing,
Grant me peace through the night
My dear, I hope your dreams are sweet as real life

Cause this is my favourite thing by far
And you defy everything I've ever known
But why,

Do you believe in fate,
Do you believe in destiny,
Would you believe me if I told you,
You complete me.
(Whoaaaaa)
I don't say this lightly.
(Whoaaaaa)
So don't take this lightly.

Cause this is my favourite thing by far
And you defy everything I've ever known
But why, why me, when you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you,
Was it nice to meet me too?

Don't tell me the things,
That you think I want to hear.
Just tell me the truth,
And the whole truth,
Your thoughts and your hopes
And your dreams and your fears.

Cause I don't have time to waste,
If all that you're looking for is to chase,
Don't make me be just another mistake,
But still it's a chance that I'm willing to take, for you.
For you.
It's all for you.

This is my favourite thing by far
And you defy everything I've ever known
But why, why me, when you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you,
Was it nice to meet me?

This, my favorite thing by far
And you defy everything I've ever known
But why, why me, when you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you,
Was it nice to meet me too?
