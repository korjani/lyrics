I defy
I defy

Kept me in the dark, always in the dark
I was waiting
You liked me pacified, kept me undermined
I'm waking up now

I gave my life
I made the time
I built it all
But you took what's mine for you
It's not for you

You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
Cos I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy

I defy

So far beyond repair
I don't really care what it costs me
You say the truth is classified
I won't be denied
You can't stop me, not now

You're criminal
Subliminal
Manipulating
I won't fall for it
I'll never quit 

You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
Cos I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy

I defy

This is my world
You are just living in it

This is my world
You are just living in it

This is my world

You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
Cos I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy

I defy

This is my world
