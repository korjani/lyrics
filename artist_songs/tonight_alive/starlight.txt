So I've been thinking lately 
That I should try to grow up 
Maybe start to show up on time 

But let's be real here baby 
It's not the way that we work 
So why waste the sunshine? 

I guess it's kinda funny 
We always throw away our money 
Right when we need it most 

But honestly I'm happy 
I don't wanna worry about 
How we got to be so broke 

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to say we're giving up if you 
Walk me home tonight I swear I could 
Fly beside you or under your starlight 
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to wait to have it all if you 
Light me up tonight I swear I could 
Never burn out under your starlight 

So you've been thinking lately 
That you don't know what you want 
But you don't know what you've got my dear 

And if it's dreams we're chasing 
You've got the world at your feet 
The skyline is so clear 

We're getting hung up on the things we should have known 
Never bothered us before 
We're try'na make ends meet but I'm starting to think 
That this is all I need and more 

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to say we're giving up if you 
Walk me home tonight I swear I could 
Fly beside you or under your starlight 
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to wait to have it all if you 
Light me up tonight I swear I could 
Never burn out under your starlight 

Well our jeans are well ripped with our pockets thin 
We don't have any change so we'll just put our hands in 
You'll keep me warm tonight 
I don't need nice things to help me sleep at night 
Well it's never felt better to have nothing but you 
And no one understands me but I'm telling the truth 
Coz we can live in our own world as long as you love me 
As long as you love me 

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to say we're giving up if you 
Walk me home tonight I swear I could 
Fly beside you or under your starlight 
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
Don't have to wait to have it all if you 
Light me up tonight I swear I could 
Never burn out under your starlight 

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up 
I'm lost tonight under your starlight
