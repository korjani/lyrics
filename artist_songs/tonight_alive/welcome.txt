Did I come at a bad time?
Did I say something wrong?
And don't tell me I'm crazy, I wouldn't be writing this song
If I didn't feel, didn't feel this way.
Baby is it real, is it real? 
Don't say I'm not dreaming
Just tell me I'm not awake.

'Cause I just don't feel welcome in this house anymore
And it just doesn't feel as safe as it did only just two days before.
Why do we come this way, I'm not sure.
Woah, but the one thing is for certain, I don't want to do this anymore.

Did I disappoint you baby or did I just take too long.
'Cause honestly lately I can't tell whats going on
And I don't want to make this about me 
And I don't want to pleed on you
But surely I've got something to do with you feeling blue

'Cause I just don't feel welcome in this house anymore
And it just doesn't feel as safe as it did only just two days before.
Why do we come this way, I'm not sure.
Woah, but the one thing is for certain, I don't want to do this anymore.
Anymore [x4]

Did I come at a bad time?
Did I say something wrong?
And don't tell me I'm crazy, I wouldn't be singing this song.

'Cause I just don't feel welcome in this house anymore
And it just doesn't feel as safe as it did only just two days before.
Why do we come this way, I'm not sure.
Woah, but the one thing is for certain, I don't want to do this anymore. [x2]
