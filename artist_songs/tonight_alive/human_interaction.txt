I need human interaction
I am under stimulated

All my dreams are pullin' me deep
Into places I know
All the while I’m fighting sleep
Darkness settling around me
My thoughts surround me

I don’t know love, I don’t know hate
I am numb, wish I could find the words to say
Asking please, as colors fade
I need to breathe
Before I turn the world to grey
I turn the world to grey

I have means for satisfaction
But a force field
Stands between on four feet

I don’t know love, I don’t know hate
I am numb, wish I could find the words to say
Asking please, as colors fade
I need to breathe
Before I turn the world to grey
I turn the world to grey

But I will be better
I will be better
I will, I will
I will be better
I will be better
I will be better
I will, I will

I don’t know love, I don’t know hate
I am numb, wish I could find the words to say
Asking please, as colors fade
I need to breathe
Before I turn the world to grey
I turn the world to grey
But I will be better
