Close your eyes, fall away
Touch the light, seize the day
If all we are is dust in space
Then tell me why I feel this way

I want more for the world that we live in
We just take, never once have you given
She will speak of her pain if you listen

Waiting on a miracle 
Thinking it'll save us all
Hoping if we turn our backs
Forget the unforgivable 
But they're not gonna change the world
We are
They're not gonna save the world 
We are

So disconnect and reattach
It's critical that we react
If all we are is consciousness
Then tell me why we've ignored this

If you're waiting for a sign
You're living with fate to fall
Hoping if you close your eyes
You'll make it all invisible
But they're not gonna change the world
We are
They're not gonna save the world 
We are

Breathe life into me
I can feel your energies
Oh we're young and we're free
We could live eternally
But the sun can only burn for so long
we can only learn from where we went wrong
