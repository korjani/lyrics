Spinning around I’m weightless
Leaving it now just taste it
It’s begun
We’ve come undone now
Spinning and I am free here
Giving it all to be here
I’m the one
Will touch this sun

Oh oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh
We’re so close
Oh oh ohohoh
Don’t let go

Well if you came home
You already know
That I would be waiting
Cause I have been praying
For you to stay close
Under the light of the full moon
(Whoa)
And if you can’t stay
I’ll wait for the day
When you can be all mine
Stay up with you all night
So don’t run away
I am your light, I will guide you home
(Whoa)

Taking a step back wishing
That you never left
I’m missing you so bad
You’re the best thing,
The best thing I ever had
Packing my bags I’m hoping
You still feel the same
And holding on like glue
Cause the one thing,
The one thing I need is you

Oh oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh
We’re so close
Oh oh ohohoh
Don’t let go

Well if you came home
You already know
That I would be waiting
Cause I have been praying
For you to stay close
Under the light of the full moon
(Whoa)
And if you can’t stay
I’ll wait for the day
When you can be all mine
Stay up with you all night
So don’t run away
I am your light, I will guide you home
(Whoa)

So let me take you back
To the night we had
Laying under the light of the full moon
And I would give anything
To be there with you

Spinning around I’m weightless

Well if you came home
You already know
That I would be waiting
Cause I have been praying
For you to stay close
Under the light of the full moon
(Whoa)
And if you can’t stay
I’ll wait for the day
When you can be all mine
Stay up with you all night
So don’t run away
I am your light, I will guide you home
(Whoa)
