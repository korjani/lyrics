Well, I'm not gonna lie.
How can I put this easy?
I try and try but what for, just to please you?
It's true, you're wasting my time.
You're just a waste of time.
And I don't see why, I should listen
to someone who can't listen to themselves.
Just listen to yourself.

Fake it, you'll never get ahead of it.
Trace it, back to where we started.
'Cause back track, baby back tracking never got you nothing.
(One step forward and two steps back.)
And if you fake it, they'll never know your real name.
Trace it, just to find it's such a shame.
You wasted your chance.
Tasted everything before you ever held it.

Well, I was never gonna complain,
but why should I hold back when I wanted to be on your side?
You're wasting my time.
You're just a waste of time.
And now I can see, all you wanted was just a chance
to be in the spot light. 
Well baby it's not right and sincerely I'm sick and tired.

Fake it, you'll never get ahead of it.
Trace it, back to where we started.
'Cause back track, baby back tracking never got you nothing.
(One step forward and two steps back.)
And if you fake it, they'll never know your real name.
Trace it, just to find it's such a shame.
You wasted your chance.
Tasted everything before you ever held it in your hands. 

They're shaking now, don't break it now.
We'll break it down, is this clear enough?

You're shaking now, don't break it now, 
we'll break it down.
You're shaking now, don't break it now, 
we'll break it down.

Everybody jump, everybody say 'Woah.'
Everybody's swaying, everybody say 'Woah.'
Everybody jump, everybody say 'Woah.'
Everybody's swaying, everybody say 'Woah.'

Fake it, you'll never get ahead of it.
Trace it, back to where we started.
'Cause back track, baby back tracking never got you nothing.
(One step forward and two steps back.)
And if you fake it, they'll never know your real name.
Trace it, just to find it's such a shame.
You wasted your chance.
Tasted everything before you ever held it in your hands. 

Wasted your chance, tasted everything before
you ever held it in your hands.
