Inhale, hold, release
Forever bound in your net of safety
And it's the most dangerous place I can be
Like torture to me
I long to taste life without boundaries

And I'm not scared
Just let me breathe my oxygen

Open my eyes
I am alive
I'm larger than life
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Leave the past behind
I have arrived 
I will light up the sky
If you let me breathe my oxygen
My oxygen

Turn my face towards the sun
Hair in the wind, down highway one
I'm looking for sense of escape
Naked I am liberated
I'll never change
I stare my fears in the face

Rules were made for us to break
Chances meant for us to take
And I know I will forsake
Determined to break away
