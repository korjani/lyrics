You're graceful, your grace falls, 
down around me in my eyes. 
You're lovely, your love leaves, 
So easily in my eyes. 

Another day left waiting, 
alone in my room with no calls from you. 
So I call you up, but you let me down, 
falling down around everyone except yourself. 

I thought that this would never end, 
things were so clear but they fell through. 
High hopes of problems never failed, 
thinking of the best. 

You're graceful, your grace falls, 
down around me in my eyes. 
You're lovely, your love leaves, 
So easily in my eyes. 

Another day left crying, 
with you in my room with nothing left to do. 
You say that it's not right, you said its over now. 
Stand still annoyed with no one around. 

I thought that this would never end, 
things were so clear but they fell through. 
High hopes of problems never failed, 
thinking of the best.
