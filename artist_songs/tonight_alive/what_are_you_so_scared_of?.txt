Well it's a sad truth, living with these hungry hands.
It's a shame, we don't know how much we have.
We're scared of what we do not know.
No matter where we wanna go.

We wait for it, to find you, to find you.
But the truth is far behind you now.
Time to say it out loud:

What are you so scared of?
Judgements not unfair.
It's what we've learned to see.

What are you afraid of?
This is not unheard of. 
Nothing's how it wasn't always meant to be, always meant to be.

And you can go on thinking that you're so hard done by,
And don't pretend you've worked so hard, just scraping by.
It's not a crime to see the light.
It doesn't mean you sleep better at night.
It's not a crime to wear a smile. 

So what are you so scared of?
Judgements not unfair.
It's what we've learned to see.

What are you afraid of?
This is not unheard of. 
Nothing's how it wasn't always meant to be, always meant to be.

Always meant to be. 

I used to be scared, I used to be like you.
I used to care, then I came unglued.
Well, it's something we all have to learn to do.

I used to be scared, I used to be like you.
I used to care, then I came unglued, unglued.

What are you so scared of?
What are you so afraid of?
What are you so scared of?
So, what are you so scared of?
Judgement's not unfair.
It's what we've learned to see.
