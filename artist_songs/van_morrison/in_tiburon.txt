Across the bay the fog is lifting
And I am here in Tiburon
That's what she said
When she was sitting looking out at the Golden Gate
In the morning dawn

Across the bay in San Francisco
Where city lights and Ferlinghetti stay
North Beach alleyways and cafés
Kerouac and Ginsberg
Gregory Corso and Neal Cassady all held sway

Vince Guaraldi would play 'Cast Your Fate To The Wind' in the distance
Lenny Bruce got busted at 'The Hungry Eye'
The 'No-Name Bar' down in Sausalito
Across the street where Chet Baker used to play

My heart was beating on the hillside
Near Belvedere and Tiburon
I need to take you back, back down to 'Frisco
Now we need each other, need each other to lean on

Vince Guaraldi would play 'Cast Your Fate To The Wind'
And we'd listen
In the evening across the way
Chet Baker would play down at the trident
With his horn he blew everybody away

The Cliff House down at the Seal Rock Hotel
Foghorns blowing all night long 'til dawn
Gerry Street culchies left their homeland a long while ago
Some have stayed, but others not for so long

My heart was beating on the hillside
Near Belvedere and Tiburon
Take you back down to San Francisco
Now we need each other more than ever to lean on
Now we need each other more than ever to lean on
Lean on me
Lean on
Now we need each other more than ever to lean on

Back to city lghts, North Beach and Broadway
We need each other
We need each other to lean on

Across the bay in Tiburon
Across the bay in Tiburon
