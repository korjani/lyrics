Put another coin in the wishing well
Tell everybody got to go to Hell
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
You'll be mine

Put another coin and make a wish
Put a spell on you and make it stick
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine

Too much water flowing underneath the bridge
Watch the world go by, contemplate what is

Throw another coin and let it shine
Baby be my Valentine
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
You'll be mine

Too much water flowing underneath the bridge
Let the world go by, contemplate what is

Throw another coin and make a wish
Put a spell on you and make it stick
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine

You'll be mine, you'll be mine, in time
You'll be mine, in time
Let it rhyme
Let it rhyme

Can you meet me at the wishing well?
