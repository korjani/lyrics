Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus if you please
I'll be satisfied as long, as I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee

I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long, as I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee

See me through days of wine and roses
By and by when the morning comes
Jazz and blues and folk, poetry and jazz
Voice and music, music and no music
Silence and then voice
Music and writing, words
Memories, memories way back
Take me way back, Hyndford Street and Hank Williams
Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet on Sunday afternoons in winter
Sidney Bechet, Sunday afternoons in winter
And the tuning in of stations in Europe on the wireless
Before, yes before it was the way it was
More silence, more breathing together
Not rushing, being
Before rock `n' roll, before television
Previous, previous, previous
See me through, just a closer walk with Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus if you please
I'll be satisfied as long, as I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee

I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long, as I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.
