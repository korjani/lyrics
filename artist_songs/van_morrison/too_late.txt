Well it's too late for sorrow, 
for sorrow, well it's too late
And it's too late for tomorrow, 
for tomorrow just can't wait

Well it's too late 
for crying in the rain
Well it's too late 
to start all over again, 
can't complain

But it's not too late 
for Wednesday in your garden 
and whoops I beg your pardon, 
please don't hesitate

Well it's too late 
for crying in the rain
It's too late 
to start all over again, 
so refrain

But it's not too late 
for Wednesday in your garden and whoops
I beg your pardon, 
just don't hesitate

Well it's too late for sorrow, 
for sorrow, baby it's too late
And it's too late for tomorrow, 
for tomorrow

Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't wait
