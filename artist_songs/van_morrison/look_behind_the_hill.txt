When your troubles are a burden 
let your mind be still
Wait until the clouds start moving 
way beyond the hill

Can't you see the sky is bluer 
up upon the ridge
Just don't let the green grass fool you, 
look beyond the hill

Sometime it don't rhyme, 
seem to have your fill
Got to get your house in order 
in line with your will

Tomorrow is another day 
to go in for the kill
You can have a change of heart now
Look beyond the hill

You've got to look beyond the hill
You've got to look beyond the hill
