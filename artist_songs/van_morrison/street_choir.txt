Street Choir
Sing me the song for the new day
Don't make it long
And remember to sing it the old way

Let it all out
Let your voice ring in the street, now
My fun
Shall be this one to complete, now

Why did you leave America?
Why did you let me down?
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around?

You know I just can't see you, now
(See you now)
In a-my, in a-my, new world crystal ball
You know I just can't free you, now
(Free you now)
That's a-not my job at all

Move it on up
Move it on up by the window, move it on
A magnificent flow
Lord, let it all grow in the moonglow

I'll take the wine
I'll take the wine with the gravy
I'll ask you the time
And just send the bill, to my baby

Why did you leave America?
Why did you let me down?
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around?

You know I just can't see you, now
(See you now)
In a-my, in a-my, in a-my
New world crystal ball

You know I just can't free you, now
(Free you now)
That's a-not my job at all

[Instrumental & harmonica]

Why did you leave America?
Why did you let me down?
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around?

You know I just can't free you, now
(Free you now)
In a-my, in a-my, in a-my
New world crystal ball

You know, you know, you know
I just can't free you, now
(Free you now)
That's not my job at all

You know, you know, you know
I just can't free you, now
(Free you now)
That's not my job at all

[Fades]
You know, you know, you know
I just can't free you, now
(Free you now).
