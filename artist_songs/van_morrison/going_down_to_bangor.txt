Well I'm going down to Bangor
I want you to bring me, bring me my bucket and spade
Well I'm going down to Bangor
Bring me my bucket and spade
I'm going down to Pickie Pool
Man we're going in the deep end

Well I got your letter this morning
When the sun was shining so bright
Well I got your letter this morning
Oh, when the sun was shining so bright
I want you to know one thing
That you're the love of my life

We're going up to Cavehill
We're going to walk on Napoleon's Nose
We're going up to Cavehill
We're going to walk on Napoleon's Nose
Way up on the hillside
Where the purple heather grows

I haven't seen my cousin Billie in such a long time
I haven't seen my cousin Billie, not in a long time
Well I saw her just the other day
She was standing in a supermarket line

Well we're going out in the charabanc
We're just as happy as we can be
Well we're going out in the charabanc
We're just as happy as we can be
Well we're going to go driving
Watch the mountains of Mourne run down to the sea

Yeah we're going down to Bangor
Just six miles from Donaghadee
Oh, we're going down to Bangor
Some six miles from Donaghadee
I want you to sing this with me
Tra-la-la, tra-la-lee

Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-lee
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-lee
It's only six miles from Bangor
To Donaghadee
