We talked about the birdies
That fly up in the trees
We talked about the moon
And the stars we couldn't see
But you keep on pretending
You don't know what's wrong with me

Come on, let's talk, about us

We talked about the good times
That made us laugh and sigh
We talked about the bad times
That brought tears to our eyes
Now, I think it's about time
For you to realize

Come on, let's talk, about us

(Hey)
Dear, I swear I'll love you, 'til the very end
But I don't plan on stickin' around
If it's just to be your friend

We've talked, an' talked, an' talked, an' talked
But there's been nothin' said
The things that you've been talkin' about
Just don't stick to my head

Sometimes I think, little girl
That your heart is filled with lead

Come on, let's talk, about us

Well, dear I swear I'll love you
Oh, 'til the very end
Well, I don't plan on stickin' around
If it's just to be your friend

We've talked, an' talked, an' talked, an' talked
And there's been nothin' said
The thing that you've been talkin' about
Just don't stick to my head
My darlin' little girl
I think that your heart is made of lead

Come on, let's talk, about us

Come on, let's talk, about us

Well, well, well, well, well

Come on, let's talk, about us
