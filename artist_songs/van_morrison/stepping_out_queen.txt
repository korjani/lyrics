Put on your lipstick
Apply your makeup
Sometimes you're living in a dream
And then you go steppin' out queen

Well you go to a party
And you laugh loud and hearty
You stay all night you know you make the scene
As you go steppin' out queen

It's just a windfall away
It's a love keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look up and say
It's just a windfall away

It's just a windfall away
It keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look out and say
It's just a windfall away

Well you go through the drama
And you work in the dharma
Then you stand up and wipe your mirror clean
And then you go steppin' out queen

Come in the garden and just look at the flowers
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
It's just a windfall away
It's a love it's a love keeps getting stronger every day
I'll come in your garden and then we'll go steppin' out
