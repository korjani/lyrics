When you've given up hope & you're down in despair
When you've given up hope & you're down in despair
When you've given up hope & you're down in despair
When you've given up-
And you sit in your room and you're all alone
And you turn to the one and you turn inside
For a while
Say, help me, angel.
Oh, no, never let spirit die.
Oh, no, spirit don't ever die.
Oh, no, never let spirit die
Oh, no, spirit don't ever die.
Spirit don't ever die.
And you go inside for a while
And you turn to the one
And you turn inside for a while.
You turn it around
And you follow the road
And you get you back out
And you follow the road
Then you get you back home
And you follow the road
And you get you back out
And you follow the road
And you get you back home.
Oh, no, never let spirit die
Oh, no, spirit don't ever die.
Oh. no, never let spirit die
Oh, no, spirit don't ever die . . .
Spirit, don't ever die
And you keep walkin' on
And you keep walkin' on
Spirit in your soul
You keep walkin' on
And you keep walkin' on
And you turn it around
And you turn it around . . .
Oh, no, spirit don't ever die.
