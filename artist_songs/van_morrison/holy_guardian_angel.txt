I was born in the midnight
Long before the break of day
Born in the midnight hour
Called the witching hour, they say

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody but me

So I pray to my holy guardian angel
Come what may, to my holy guardian angel
So I pray to my holy guardian angel
In the witching hour

Well my restless mind starts to wander
Known it all of my days
Need lifted up by the spiritual
When I begin to think on these things

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody but me

So I pray to my holy guardian angel
At the end of the day, to my holy guardian angel
So I pray to my holy guardian angel
In the witching hour

So I pray to my holy guardian angel
At the end of the day, to my holy guardian angel
So I pray to my holy guardian angel
In the witching hour

Came into this world in the midnight hour
Long before the break of day
Born in the midnight
Called the witching hour, they say

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody but me

So I pray to my holy guardian angel
At the end of the day, to my holy guardian angel
So I pray to my holy guardian angel
In the witching hour
In the witching hour

Holy guardian angel
Holy guardian angel
Holy guardian angel
In the witching hour
