I was Mr Nice Guy too long
And I found out that was wrong
And I played the losing role
Now I'm standing at your door
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold again

I didn't know just what was going on
Behind my back for so long
People that couldn't tell right from wrong
Now I'm standing here all alone
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold again

Travelled up and down all around the world
Just to get to nowhere
In the final round I found
How many people really did care

And every time I try talking to you
You don't hear what I'm going through
In this dog eat dog world I'm in
It's a crying shame and it's a sin
To be out in the cold again
To be out in the cold again

Travelled up and down, up and down, up and down
Just to end up nowhere, end up nowhere
In the final round I found
Many people did care

And then they welcome me back home
Right back into the fold
But I'm still out, still out here on a limb
I'm on the outside just looking in
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold again

In between the times where it feels alright
To the cold black night
In between the times where it feels alright
To the dead of the cold black night
In between the dusk and the dawn
And the cold black night
Trying not to get too uptight
Trying not to show the strain
Having to hide my pain

In between the times where it feels a little bit right
In the day, in the cold black night
In the early morning dawn
