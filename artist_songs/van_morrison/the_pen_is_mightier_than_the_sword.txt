You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
Every man is me, every man is you
I can't tell you what you've got to do
You've got to live by the pen, it's mightier than the sword

You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the law
Every man is me, every man is you
I can't tell you what you have to do
You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword

You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the law
You've got to live by the pen 'cause of what you saw
Every man is me, every man is you
I can't tell you what you're supposed to do
I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword

I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
Every man is me, every man is you
But I can't tell you what you have to do
I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword

They're gonna get burned because they're playing with fire
They're gonna get caught 'cause somebody is a liar
Every man is me, every man is you
I can't tell you what you're supposed to do
You've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword

I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
I've got to live by the pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
Every man is me, every man is you
I can't tell you what you're supposed to do
I've got to live by my pen 'cause it's mightier than the law
I've got to live by my pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
I've got to live by my pen 'cause it's mightier than the sword
