All the people were waiting for Crazy Face
He said he'd meet them at his favourite place
Dressed in black satin, white linen and lace
With his head held high and a smile on his face
And he said:
'Ladies and gentlemen, the prince is late'

As he stood outside the church-yard gate
And polished up on his .38
And said:
'I got it from Jesse James'

[Instrumental & sax solo]

All the people were waiting for Crazy Face
He said he'd meet them at his favourite place
Dresses in a-black satin, white linen and lace
With his head held high and a smile on his face
And he said:
'Ladies and gentlemen, the prince is late'

As he stood outside the church-yard gate
And polished up on his .38
And said:
'I got it from Jesse James'.
