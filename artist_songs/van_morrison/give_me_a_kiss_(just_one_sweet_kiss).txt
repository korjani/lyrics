Honey, just one sweet kiss
Baby, from your sweet lips
Honey, just a-one sweet kiss
Baby, from your sweet lips
That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied

Honey, just one a-your smiles
Lord, makes it all worthwhile
Honey, just a-one a your smiles
Lord, makes it all worthwhile
That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied

We could go walkin' down the lane
Together, hand in hand
But if you think, it's gonna rain
We'll stay at home, an' listen to the band

Baby, just one a-your kisses
Right-a from your sweet lips
Baby, just want a sweet kiss
Right-a from your sweet lips
That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied

Do-doot n' do-dit, do-dit, do-dit
Do-doot n' do-dit, do-dit, do-dit
Do-doot n' do-dit, n' do-dit, do-dit
Do-doot n' do-dit, do-dit, do-dit
Doot-do, do-do n' do-do, do

We could go walkin' down the lane
(Swop-swop, swop-swop)
Together hand in hand
(Swop-swop, swop-swop)
But if you think it's gonna rain
(Swop-swop, swop-swop)
Stay at home and listen to the band
(Do-wop, do-wop, do-wop)

A baby, just one sweet kiss
Honey, honey, honey from a-your sweet lips
Baby, just one sweet smile
That makes ev'rything worth while
That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied

[Instrumental]

That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied.
