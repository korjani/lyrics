Deep in a bunker underground
There is a voice that makes no sound
Invisible words explode with scorn and
Silently stir up the howling storm

Ariel there was a fire in your house they say
And now your bedroom is all up in flames
There was a fire in your house they say
They say you've been dancing with the devil

You lay the arrow on the string
And throw the sand into the wind
Every grain bursts into flame
And the wind blows it back again

Ariel there was a fire in your house they say
And now your bedroom is all up in flames
There was a fire in your house they say
They say you've been dancing with the devil

Ariel has disappeared
How could she be so damn naive
Dancing with the devil
Maybe the devil took her
Or maybe she just chose to leave
Dancing with the devil
Ariel there was a fire in your house they say
And now your bedroom is all up in flames
There was a fire in your house they say
They say you've been dancing with the devil
