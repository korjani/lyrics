Never fall in love with a stranger
And that, son, they all said to me
And never fall in love with a stranger
But I can't help it if she falls in love with me

And never fall in love with a stranger
Now, they've gone against my command
And never fall in love with a stranger
The pain is written in my hands

But if I can't resist
Find my way outta this

She knows that our love more than any river flows
And I'm done now, all of my intentions are exposed
Not hidden in my clothes
Or in between my toes

I wanna tombstone pearl handle revolver
Don't wanna meet a pale man with a halo in his hair
Never fall in love with a stranger
But sometimes I simply do not care

And if I can't resist
Get my way outta this

She knows that our love more than any river flows
And I'm done now, all of my intentions are exposed
Not hidden in my clothes
Or in between my toes

I done things right, pretty much all of my life
I'm not looking for any sympathy
I can run all I like away from that stranger
But somehow she'll always follow me
