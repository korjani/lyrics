Love
Yeah one love
That's love
We ain't worried about the hate my nigga
Just love
Yeah

Most niggas don't know what love is or what ain't
But I'm here to tell you what is
Man if I ain't the realest then who the fuck is
I seen brothers violating their mothers
That ain't gonna cut it cuz
Love is unconditional
Unpredictable
Once you listen to someone that's giving you
More than they give they self
Gotta remember their path
Won't leave you hanging they'll probably give you his last
Won't let you smoke he'll throw your cigs in the trash
Even though you try to fight him
He'll put that shit in the past
Can't see you hurt yourself
Till you murk yourself
He rather see you outwork yourself
Gotta stay away from negative people
Even if they relatives
Once was an angel turned devil
The devil is closer than you think
My nigga past blood
I'm hoping that you pray for me

Cuz that's love
Yeah one love
Yeah that's love
And we ain't worried about the hate my nigga
Just love
Yeah

Most women ain't never had love
Too busy giving they number out while they at clubs
If that's love then what do you call lust
If that's love then what do you call trust
No wonder you all stuck
No wonder you broads fucked up
In the head in the bed with the next nigga
On the ground the caption says he's the best nigga
Then one month later he's your ex-nigga
We ain't impressed
Let the niggas be niggas and men be men
Wasted all that time for an MCM
So what if he bought a fucking purse
When your ass got sick did he become a nurse
Did he support your grind knowing you love your work
Did he make any changes for what it's worth
That's what I thought
My's it's looking like you lost my
That shit is priceless
Love don't cost my
So now you know that's love

One love
That's love
And we ain't worried about the hate no more
Just love [x2]
Yeah just love

Take a couple bars off let Tony look
That's love
Y'all rap niggas gotta start showing y'all producers love my nigga
Yeah one take man
Man I love Ricky L's I ain't even gotta say it
In a trap so long he ain't even gotta weigh it
Shout out to my parents they're my number one fans
Mama know the words I ain't even gotta play it
Yeah I love Diana but I hate it when she fed it
My nigga P taught me about the cadence
My cousin in Cali glad he saw his cousin made it
But I don't feel I made it till both of us make it
So both of us take it to a whole hunned acres
On the road doing shows
Niggas know I'm the greatest
Got a bond and I don't wanna break it down
We the fucking underdogs but we so underrated
How you get an opportunity and don't wanna take it
Man I love my God
Niggas know why I'm playing
I be so wide awake and I get no sleep
If mad men don't eat then I won't eat
Now that's love

Yeah yeah
One love
Shit crazy
Yeah that's love
And we ain't worried about the hate my nigga
Just love
Yeah just love
That's love (hooo)
Love
That's love
Love
That's love
