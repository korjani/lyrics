Anti
Yeah yeah
From a girl to a woman
And from a queen to a goddess
Honestly we were dishonest
Still can't believe that we bonded
Look at the team that we started
We had a dream of
Only upon your arrival
I noticed we had departed
We had the part where
I was at parties in need of a partner
Should have believed in my father
I put my feet where my heart was
I took you around the world
Like Detective Lee did to Carter
Damn it's rush hour
I tried to tell you shoot for the stars
But look how you snowed at the gunpowder
We love power
But the power of love can overcome that lust that was ours
But what's ours
Do we even have each other
Do we even have another option
If we can't rebuttal all of a sudden can't be subtle
Can't discover
How we went from hater brother
From brother to fucking to fucking raw shit
Then to lover
I tried to tell you about that friendzone shit
I ain't the man you hit the friendzone with
Don't speak on your independence
Knowing you depend on this
I ain't even used a pen on this
Anti yeah
Anti there
Anti anti
Woo
I wonder you gonna fall in love baby
There's no way we can be friends
That way girl
Even if you paid me
I'm anti friendzone
And if I don't do you right who's wrong
Cuz you knew from the beginning what I was on
Now you reach out social water
How you expect me not to go crazy
When you got a body like that baby baby
Only a fool would not hit that
We're the perfect mix match
You can't even trip on that
Cuz you put your lips on me
You can tell him whatever you want
Girl I'm just a homie
You keep putting those hips on me
I'm anti and I
And I'm anti
How you gonna put those two legs in front of me
And think I'm not gonna divide
I'm anti
Anti
There's no way we can be friends
Aw girl
Get fucked
