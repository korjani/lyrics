[Hook:]
Good life, good days, good nights
Don't let your life go by
Don't let your life go by
One life, one life

[Verse 1 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Be loyal, faithful, grateful, graceful
Most don't even know that the devil was an angel
I'm able, no Cain, to heal the disabled
Then march like the month before April
Now may you, take two, minutes out your day to
Learn to play the game and never let it play you
Go and make a little change just know it might change you
It's painful, but notice that the pain is what made you
It's fatal, they hate you
But even though you hate me I'll save you
Tryna turn wine back to grape juice, I raise you
Cowards sweet and sour like grapefruit
Y'all just nosy like nasal, spray off the facial
Break you down and lift you just to face you
And even though I keep missing church homie I pray too
Pastor we can bet I outpray you
Hole in the bread like a bagel, bring the food up to the table
Let's eat nigga

[Hook:]
Good life, good days, good nights
Don't let your life go by
Don't let your life go by
One life, one life

[Verse 2:]
Thank you, all y'all, no time for shout outs
Still mad at Manny and Floyd, I want a knock out
Mi casa su casa, your crib is my house
Cause home is the place where the real niggas hide out
Scream thug life like I was raised in Pac house
Told my brother jewelry have Amy Winehouse
What good is hard in the paint if you don't box out
Sirens, gunshots, blocka blocka blockout
Y'all niggas blockin', I bring the block out
Same niggas coppin' be the same ones that cop out
Niggas know what time it is, no need to bring the watch out
But watch out, niggas still ball through the lock out
Fuck all the turn up, bring the hip hop out
TEAUXNY told Illa tell Ells to bring Bop out
So peep the boom bap just to [fop] out
Hop out, real life all day, ain't shit to lie about

[Hook:]
Good life, good days, good nights
Don't let your life go by
Don't let your life go by
One life, one life

[Sample from the Matrix:]
Hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability

[Verse 3 - JID:]
I never been scared to face satan
But when God speaks I'm in my boots shaking
Like a stripper, no tips, I guess my pops making pace
With dodging the undertaker with a fucking pacemaker
In his chest, where your heart at
I been told y'all niggas I'll start the artist and flow to bring the renaissance back
You just want to dance, you don't want to dap
Used to bending over, you remind me of a hunchback
Notre Dame, my ego grows with every line
Fetty condo, black American
Not pushing a Chevy or a foreign whip of any kind
My girl no foreign but very fine
She's a jewel and my manager's a jew
And you my friend are looking real confused
To the point you don't know how to move
Come here young nigga, I'll "Luke I am your father" you
Put you on some real shit, knowledge and the logicals
I just want to help so if it's anything that I could do
For you

[Verse 4:]
For the sake of the life I'm living
The days and the nights I'm giving
I pray when I fight religion
My vision mentally stuck in a cage with the likes of prison
I'm paying the price and itching on making the right decisions
I live with hella denial but it's whatever
With a crazy ass façade that my parents gone' live forever
I'm ignorant to the fact that I think they'll never leave earth
Cursed to the fact I'd rather they bury me first
Unnecessary it hurts, destiny lurks
In hell's kitchen that holy recipe work
But it seems at every funeral the past is delusional
Under the impression that losing a life's the usual
Nobody died and made you God, nigga who are you?
I'm putting two and two together
I lick my index finger put it in the air to predict the weather
So notice it's no coincidence Y is my favorite letter
I got questions

[Verse 5 - Translee:]
Growing impatient of patiently waiting
My state been waiting for me to make a statement and come out the basement
Aching to get a placement in your top five lottery
It could all be gone tomorrow like a midnight robbery
A poll of rappers around me surrounding a round table
Rounding a sound player with melodies outdated
I'm dating a date with destiny, never could downplay it
Put your grandma against my grandma, she never could out pray her
We so good over here, we so good
And since I left for college I been living in the hood
Crazy ain't it, my feelings emaciated
Dope dealers don't take vacations so why should I
Why should I feel like I ain't replaceable?
I rap about my life to copycats that is untraceable
Get your own life, motherfucker I ain't available
Me being heard is a must like no deodorant
A little bit off the topic but this shit was more appropriate
I does this

[Verse 6 - Freddie Foxxx/Bumpy Knuckles:]
Talk sports on the corner, work for the coroner
When egos start to explode, we in trap mode
Money looking tight, niggas in these diamond chains, they looking right
Pause, this ain't about what's in your fucking drawers
It's about you leaking bloody snot bubbles
Cause that chain ain't in my muddy paws
My own neighborhood is rundown
Here go the run down, I want to be a better example to my son now
Deep bars over that gun pow
Music to the street, I shoot you for one thou
Grown man bars, written in memoirs
The legacies will never read the rappers was this hard
Real beef in these streets is undeb'table
Mic skills on these beats is incredible
Something that happened but it's nothing I'm rapping so
The life shit that I spit is inevitable
