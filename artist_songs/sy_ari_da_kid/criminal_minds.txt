I look the knife and slit his throat
Like a chef would steak
This shit is wild cuz we was cool just yesterday
Bag on the floor with all the cash and the diamonds
Thirsty had a look in his eyes all demonic
And all in time and next thing you know it
Thirsty shot Illa
Tony shot Thirsty
I shot Tony while he shot me
Who'd a thought B
I woke up this morning
That I was gonna die today
Let's start from the beginning
Yeah
Criminal minds
Criminal thoughts yeah
I woke up starving
Brushed my teeth and got something to drink
Turkey bacon and waffles then made a run to the bank
A little deposit just for my bills to withdraw
How can I profit when I'm working just to say I ain't got it
Waiting in line white man in the front taking his time
Cuz he knows that he's rich and I ain't making a dime
Shit can't just recline cuz playing it safe just ain't designed to get us paid
So I'm thinking of crimes
That's when I pulled out
Put the 38 to his spine
Told the teller to show me her hands
Empty the register
Bag full of hunneds twenties a bunch of fifties
Used the crack ass as shells
Told the cop he's coming with me
When niggas turn criminal they don't go back
I didn't come to kill nobody but they don't know that
My eyes made the cops put his gun down
Fuck it I'm on the run now
I'm getting nervous thinking about my son now
But It's too late for all that soft shit
I'm driving fast but cautious
Feeling nauseous becoming exhausted
Heart racing like Usain Bolt
You get that feeling in your legs like you can't walk
It's like you got a lot to say but you can't talk
You'll do whatever it takes to get these bills past due paid off
So i pulled over to a safe location
Then we slowly set the car on fire so the jakes won't trace them
Then we changed clothes and guess what was next
He winked at me as I gave him his cut then left
Criminal minds
Criminal thoughts
Yeah
I woke up the next morning with the cockiest smirk
Ain't feeling guilty cuz fuck it ain't nobody get hurt
There's only two things to life
Either you lose or you win
And since I came up I might as well do it again
That's how my enemies became my role models
I make a play and want more
I tried to gain but this game is so hollow
Got a phone call white man hit me he got another plan
Five man job we each walk with a couple grand
Hit my mans Tony and Illa
You see Tony a dealer
But yo Illa shit homie a killer
And Big Thirsty was the get away driver
He whip the vans like coups and keep the hands on demand like Snoop
My man like you I fear no man
Born and raised a poor man
That's why my heart colder than the snow man yo
Anyway we at the meet up spot
To speak on how we gonna re-up to flee from cops
You see what's not gonna happen is
Any mistakes or accidents
Playing Grand Theft Auto for practicing
Now the plan is to run up on this Russian dude next
Gun in my sweats like who wanna play Russian Roulette
No regrets nigga I know what it takes
Riding to his place for that money and the diamonds in the safe
We straight Tony cut off surveillance
We are preparing to make our move
Waiting for that call for clearance
Got the call now
Illa knocked the front guards out
Now the other guards coming with their guns all out
See what y'all about to witness is
How the victims is
Not the suspects or witnesses
Where images of death flashing
He put the shooters in place
Then he quickly hit the room with the safe
That's when I moved him away
Too in his face y'all two minutes late
Told him type the combination
I'm losing all my patience
As the door opened I noticed the safe was empty
See now I'm feeling kinda played and I ain't so friendly
As Satan in me shot him right in his calf
I'm screaming at him like
What happened to the diamonds and cash
He said a white man just robbed him and dashed
About two minutes before I arrived and I was two minutes late
Okay it's time to ride side to side
Maybe I should go get a 9 to 5
Fuck it I'm thinking homicide
Rent-A-Cop to nine
Told Big Thirsty meet me about a block away
Tony your in-law already at the spot
Okay this cracker gonna die today
This cracker gonna fly away
My fortune is gonna fry his face
Gonna put him inside his grave
Tony hit me like Big get out
Said he saw the white man leaving setting off a bomb in the house
Now I'm running like I got extra legs
As I escaped the explosion I know we thinking I was left for dead
Now we speeding in the wind we know we ain't live
In the way Thirsty drive we gonna beat him to his crib
We waiting in his living room pitch black
Big straps fully loaded with the kickback
I hear him walking up the stairs about to open the door
Fucking snowstorm it ain't nothing colder than war
That's when he walked in and hit the lights
Soon as he saw me tried to run but Illa hit him twice
I look the knife and slit his throat
Like a chef would steak
This shit is wild cuz we was cool just yesterday
Bag on the floor with all the cash and all the diamonds
Thirsty had a look in his eyes all demonic
And all in time and next thing you know it
Thirsty shot Illa
Tony shot Thirsty
I shot Tony while he shot me
His was a head shot game is over
Tried to hit me in the head but it grazed my shoulder
I pick up the bag and hit the hallway
Then I heard a Russian voice say
This is your day
Then he...
