[Intro - Da Kid:]
Ay shawty, we were wondering if we could borrow some brown sugar
We yo goddamn new neighbors
And if it's cool let me get 2 eggs and a slice of cheese man
Feel me

[Verse 1 - Da Kid:]
I'm on the south side that's where Dae Dae chill
I'm rocking fake Js but I say they real
I only bought em cause the colors match
Got em at the flee market I can't bring them fuckers back
If anybody peep that they would probably show us
I might wear em tomorrow if nobody notice
And fuck a retail I wait for the low
Same outfit 2 days in a row
She says she hate it when I call women bitches
I said I hate the fact that all her niggas bitches
Got a couple hoes got a few tramps
Got a grown bitch I'm using for her food stamps

[Hook x2 - Da Kid:]
Broke nigga moves [x3]
This how broke niggas do
Broke nigga moves [x2]
I know, I used to be a broke nigga too

[Verse 2 - Da Kid:]
I'm on the north side that where Teezy be
Couple turkeys and a bootleg DVD
Laughing at my pain shit it funny partna
Coulda hit the movies but that would have cost me 20 dollars
Man I'm starving hope my bitch home
Only nigga in the club with a flip phone
Bill collectors tryna wrestle like I'm Steve Austin
Hate driving downtown ain't no free parking
All these road trips, but if yo man fly
Fuck a first class, bitch I'm stand-by
Broke nigga make you sit, I ain't asked y'all
Driving fast heard my nigga selling gas cards

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Sean Teezy:]
They call me Teezy on the north side
Get it free with no ID up in sports line
Yo bitch yelling from courtside
Never mind that silly ho
Chose up cause she seeing me with a helicopter in my video
Now the more money I make, the less I wanna spend
Ain't no smoking up all my weed and I ain't feeding your friends
No I can't, you get's no love
Lame ass try and catch a dollar at the strip club

[Hook x2]
