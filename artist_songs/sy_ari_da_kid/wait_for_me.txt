Aye shawty
Don't worry about them other niggas they corny
Don't worry about them other bitches they bore me
I'm straight forward
I can't call it
That's why I don't pick up the phone when they call me
So wait for me
Made mistakes I ain't afraid to say sorry
Your friends hating on me
Girl why you ain't want me
Wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me

He can't kill our vibe girl
Judging by your options, you got hella time girl
Let me open up your mind girl
Now I hope you that's mine girl

Can't wait to show you off to all my niggas

Hello baby its me
I see you're not with your girl anymore
So I'm guessing you have some free time for me right
I miss you

Or get a bite to eat
Go to some of the shops downtown
Let me know
Hope to see you soon darling
Bye

I've been had it so why can't I have it again
Hi my baby

And I'm blowing up your phone cause I'm drunk
I'm sorry, bye
