[Girl:] Good mornting. Um... nothing bout to go workout and theeeeeen run some errands
[Sy:] I was just callin to say good morning
[Girl:] Good morning... ok. What's wrong?

Who was the one
You was the one that
Said it wouldn't work
Girl do what you need, do what you want I...
Shoulda put you first, Instead I warned you
You ain't gotta give me no deadline for you
It's cuffin season, I'll do fed time for you
Performing girl I'll be the headline for you...
Fucking right girl, yea

Fuck dem other bitches I don't wanna lady
I don't wanna wife em, I just one night em
I ain't nuthin nice, you ain't nuthin like em
You so indecisive, I'm so undecided
Yea, bout to start another fire
Yea, you so mutha'fuckin bias
Yea, and you know the winters mines girl, And the summer's ours
Back when you ain't have a ride girl you was a rider
Sick of sleeping with these bitches, they fuckin tired
I'm just hoping that you spare me, no fucking tire
Baby tell me what it is, I don't want surprises
Looking at me like a player, a womanizer
Girl this shit ain't adding up, we so undivided
Real recognize real, you don't recognize em...
Just walk away...

B4, b4, b4, (B4 I reach the stars)
B4, b4, b4, (B4 I break your heart)
B4, b4, b4... (B4)
Yay yay oh yay...
Yay yay oh yay...
Yea, Before your heart breaks

Why you even wanna start bae
Playing games you ain't even at a arcade
Don't you dare call me dark trade (?)
And you sweeter than a parfait
Showing you affection in the broad day
Richer than the people on Broadway, meet me on Park Place (pull up on me)
I play the villain like Scarface, ride a wave like shark bait
You just wanna keep ya heart safe
But I be doing it the hard way
You know you gone love me always... just walk away

B4, b4, b4, (B4 I reach the stars)
B4, b4, b4, (B4 I break your heart)
B4, b4, b4... (B4)
Yay yay yay yaaaaaaaaaya
Yay yay yay yaaaaaaaaaya
