Oh really

You with one of lame bitches huh
Ok cool, its cool
See if I really needed something that'd be fucked up
I'm sick of this shit man
You better call me when you get this voicemail
Bye nigga

You ain't got to act out so other women would know
I told you things that only my niggas'll know
Say you hear its like you not listening though
And shit was all good 5 minutes ago
I look high but keep a lot of shit on the low
Cause ain't nothing sweet but a cinnamon roll
Them other hoes saying Sy get it and go
We only want to hit the scene when y'all tripping at home
So stop tripping at home
Cause you forgot this is your home
This shit crazy
Ya, a whole lot changed in about 5 minutes
5, 5
Told you I'm cutting off all my bitches
I ain't nothing like my niggas girl I promise
Just don't tell 'em that I said that
Just don't think that I'm dishonest
I don't want no one else
It seem like you don't want heaven
And I can't say fuck you
Its no one I'd run to
I know I love you for sure
