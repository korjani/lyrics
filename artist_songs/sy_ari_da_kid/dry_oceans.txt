[Hook x2:]
So tired of these thoughts
From the times that we talked, till the times that we fucked
I'm surprised that we lost, all the pride that we brought
In the lines that we crossed, both tryna be the boss
Saying what's mine will be yours
Whenever your eyes dry from crying, we could die for it all

[Verse 1:]
Momma said say what I'm feeling, to make sure when I say it you feel it
You said the other day I was tripping. Wait, okay, I was tripping
Or we was, cause I don't see what's the big deal, when you know I'm faithful to women
But, you say it don't make a difference. Why?
Cause for the last six years I remained independent
Or maybe I'm just afraid of commitment or committed to be afraid of what's missing
And what's missing is, I'll wait
I'll face the fact, I pushed women back just to feel safer to distance
Shit! Dry oceans on a rage of existence

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
See, knowing both my parents are still together
Brother happily married, I'm starting to feel the pressure
It's still whatever, I'm good if you feeling better
Open the envelope, the message is in the letter, like
"Dear Love, we here love
I'd rather not box in that ring, let's share gloves
I really can offend you, shit
Cause you was with me shooting in the gym when I could barely even dribble
You say I make time for things that I want, and you right
But them bills is due every month
And I need to feed family, need to be loved
Like a feen needs drugs and vampires need blood."

[Hook x2]

[Bridge:]
We could die for it all
When your tears dry and they gone
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all
From the rise to the fall
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all
You ain't gotta cry no more
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all
