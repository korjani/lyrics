[Verse - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Gotta know I ain't nothing like other niqqas
See I baked and grill like other niqqas you dig
Like dirt with a shovel in it, I'm under ground like a tunnel with tunnel vison
I got all my stats in double digits, your girl on my phone right now she fucking with it
She wetter then a ditch with a puddle in it, chew a niqqa cause I got flavors I'm bubblicious
Pause but to all my Bros I love you niqqas, where I'm from it ain't what you did
But what you didn't
She I would lay back with something chillin but I got bills like I'm down with druggin' women
How you niqqas druggin' women for a hobby bro, might still watch The Cosby Show
If the networks playing but no love for bill Cosby thou, so tired of you butt shot body hoes
Meat hanging out the buns like a sloppy joe but will I still hit probably so, my whole posse know
Saying "free the queen Wiley yo" in the flow so hockey cold I rock tims but I'm not Deebo
The block hot like hibachi stoves what I was told like when I got repoed
See I would push rocks like a rocky robe but the cops giving out time like the watch resold cream

[Outro - The Crew:]
Cash rule everything around me cream get the money dollar, dollar bill ya'll
This was my favorite shit growing up, ya'll don't even know I'm doing this shit man
Fat and ess in back paws bullshitin' ess sleep like a fucking grizzly bear him and thristy
Sleep on they side ion know why its a big niqqa thing probably
My niqqa faps what's all in sporting goods not athletic thou just in sporting goods look for a
Fucking heating pad "my back, my back", shut up niqqa, pussies ass niqqas man
