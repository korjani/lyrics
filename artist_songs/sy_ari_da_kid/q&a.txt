Bae you need get some act right
And I don't want to talk about last night
(aye)
Cause you know you can get that last slice
And that's light
You know I'm just not used to answering questions
Out of all of these women girl you was the best one
And we official like ref girl, we could bet some
(wait)
Cause I never bet on my ladies (oh no)
And girl you forever was crazy
But you forever my lady
I never would play you
I never would play you
Girl I've been saving to take you to all of the places I never could take you
And I never said I was ready
I'm working so hard to put bread on the table
Fuck all your friends girl we fed off them haters
(fuck em')
And you fed up with favors
(fed up)
But I got shit set up for later
So hold up

Feel like
You feel like I'm not sure
I said what's mine is yours
You said I made you insecure
If answer all your questions just don't say you got one more
No more questions
No more questions
Just don't lie to me, lie to me oh no
I'm no player
No more questions

No more drama
Girl I'm a boss and I know you a rider, know you a rider
Be mine solution I got enough problems
I did things I ain't proud of
But if you got me then I got us
I'm no longer where I was, word to mama
How you always come with this shit
Like damn girl I ain't even diss shit
Why you let them lames gas you
Tell 'em niggas pull up at the Quiktrip
(skrtt)
Girl you know I pull up on you with the quickness
(skrtt)
Trying crop a nigga out like a picstich
Steady worrying about the hoes on my hit list
But you know nigga don't love you like I do

Feel like
You feel like I'm not sure
I said what's mine is yours
You said I made you insecure
If answer all your questions just don't say you got one more
No more questions
No more questions
Just don't lie to me, lie to me
I'm no player
No more questions

Baby you need get some act right
And I don't want to talk about last night
You fucking right
You know I just not used to answering questions
Girl I'm just not used to answering questions
