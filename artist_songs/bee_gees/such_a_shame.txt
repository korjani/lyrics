All that I hear doesn't feel right. Don't
call me 'till you're all right. I listened
and I heard but don't tell me. La de da.. Once in a
while he says good night. Will I care if
sometimes he is right? What a shame, it's
the same each day. La de da... Oh how I
tried! I just sat
and then I cried. Maybe I'm wrong
or will I find out when I'm gone? There is so much fun
in my leisure. Don't bother me, man, just stay there. If it's a sin, I'll
convert me astray. La de da... Come be home with me,
it's not a shame for you to
see Oh
let it be and you'll miss reality.
