I do not need you. Nor do I listen to the words you say.
Strongly I heed you. But ev'ry promise seems to fade away.
Who is the clown that walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man who does what he can but never does it right?

How can I prove? There is no reasoning or asking why.
Only to prove. I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes.
