If you think that you can hurt me and make me cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Now I've got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by

So, if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by

So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
