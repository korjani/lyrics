We must have lost the road
Don't you think it's getting late
Maybe if it's colder we can stop and wait

We must have lost the words
All the little things we said
And now the world is frozen only you in my mind

Oh ,we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

We must have lost the tune
Where did I step out of line
I'll search for the melody that calls you mine

Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

[repeat last chorus and fade out]
