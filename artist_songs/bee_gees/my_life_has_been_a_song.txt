Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Here as I sleep, the love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep the tune that plays too long
My life has been a song

Ev'ry sound in my head, ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Ev'ry sound in my head , ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Ev'ry sound in my head , ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
