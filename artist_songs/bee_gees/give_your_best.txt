It's a square dance Mr Marshall. It's a square dance on the floor.
It's a square dance Mr Perkins.  It's a square dance to be sure, to be sure.
Ev'rybody, grab partners ...

I'm just a clown that used to run around .
I used to have a million friends.
I used to start where ev'rybody ends.
But I just give my best to my friends .

I've done my shows. Ev'rybody knows .
I nearly sold all my clothes.
One man can give; another has to lend.
So I just give my best to my friends.
[spoken] and so you should .

And when you think that your life isn't right.
You know the day isn't always like night.
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight.
Just give your best to your friends.
