If your happy and marching forward in your band
Holding hands together, I will understand
In my life I'm together on my own
With my own private eggshell, and my phone

If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

If you're happy living down on the ground
Where the crippled and the blind alone can see
I got a feeling God is still around
And if I'm right , there must be more then this to see

If your mind is in the darkness , could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind

And as soon as you discover where you're goin'
Can I walk along the way , along the way
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowin'
Just a few nice words to get me through the day

If your mind is in the darkness , could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world just a frame of mind

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

[break]

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone
