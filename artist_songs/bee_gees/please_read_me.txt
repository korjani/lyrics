Many years ago I was a simple man
A simple man, no worries me;
I never lied
Please read me.

Not much conversation ever came from me,
I never saw reality;
I never tried.
Please read me.

Ah....

Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through, explain why
Please read me. Please read me. Please read me.
