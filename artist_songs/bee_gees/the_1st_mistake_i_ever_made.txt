I ain't got no claim to nothing.
I don't mess with anyone.
I walk my way living in a masquerade.
And one day I looked behind me at all the things I've done.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.

I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo.
Never knew the man who never stayed.
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.

With a million hearts I've broken.
I never kept the score.
Memories of good love hate to stay.
But I still remember someone who loved me so much more.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.

So, when nothing's worth the living and in the night I look above.
Prayed, about a million times I prayed.
I know my story ended when I lost my only love.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.

I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo.
Never knew the man who never stayed.
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.
