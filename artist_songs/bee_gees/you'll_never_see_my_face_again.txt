Ev'ry single word has been spoken.
It's much to late to change your ways.
Far too many vows have been broken.
You can't expect a soul to stay.
You think that you can stand and lie.
It makes me laugh . You got no friends.
It took a thousand years to find out why.
You'll never see my face again .

You know that you've been left before this night.
It's come my turn to make it over.
I wish that ev'ry thing was coloured white.
I wish that I could be a rover.
You think that you can stand and lie.
It makes me laugh.You got no friends.
It took a thousand years to find out why.
You'll never see my face again .

[repeat 1st verse]
