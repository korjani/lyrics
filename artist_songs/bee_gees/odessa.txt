Fourteenth of February , eighteen ninety nine.
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign.
Baa baa black sheep, you haven't any wool.
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull.

Cherub, I lost a ship in the Baltic sea.
I'm on an iceberg running free.
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship;
Sailing my way back to your lips.
One passing ship gave word that you have moved out of your old flat.
You love the Vicar more then words can say.
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away.
And I'll see your face again .

Odessa, How strong am I?
Odessa, How time goes by.

Treasure , you know the neighbours that live next door.
They haven't got their dog anymore.
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic.
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore.
I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland.
You love that Vicar more then words can say.
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away.
And I'll see your face again.

Odessa, How strong am I?
Odessa, How time goes by.
