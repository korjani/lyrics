You wanna make me big man, a star on a screen.
Some kind of James Brown or something in between.
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms.
I can't live on glory when your bendin' both my arms.

I, I was a lion in winter.
And man I had friends for miles around.
I was a lion in my winter.
What good's a lion Lord, without a crown.

You're living in a cave man, upon your marble throne.
You think you own the heavens, but you've got to be alone.
You know I prayed for sunshine, a woman with my name.
I don't want to live man, you gave away the game.

I, I was a lion in winter.
And man I had friends for miles around.
I was a lion in my winter.
What good's a lion Lord, without a crown.
