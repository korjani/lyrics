George was born somewhere inside London town
Working as he grew for that extra pound.
Respected by all he married and made a home.
To give his children more then he had known.

But then he died with out an explanation.
He never lied , a very sincere relation.

Years before a fire sent him in the street.
It took him months of work to make ends meet.

But then he died without and explanation.
He never lied , a very sincere relation .
