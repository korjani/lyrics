A tint of blue , deep down inside my heart, each time I see you
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover , jealous I
I get so angry I could cry

A tint of blue , why do you make me feel so sad
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
A tint of blue

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover, jealous I
I get so angry I could cry
