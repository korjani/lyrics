This is my swan song. Whatever I do now, I do it well.
This is my swan song. I fell in love with you I love you well.
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing,
My love will build a castle in the air.

This is my last chance, a chance to show the world that I am strong.
This is my last dance. I'm walking off the floor where I belong.
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing,
My love will build a castle in the air.

[music] La.....

And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing,
My love will build a castle in the air.

This is my swan song. I fell in love with you , I love you well,
I love you well, I love you well.
