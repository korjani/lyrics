I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
Why haven't I been told?
I need someone to know me and to show me
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down

Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home
I need someone to know me and to show me
Sitting cross - legged on my own and yet I'm not alone
Don't need no one to show me
No one owns me
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down

Trafalgar [repeat line and fade out]
