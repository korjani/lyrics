I hear you calling me 'dearest' too.
My dearest, I'm nearest, then I've ever been before
To have you calling me 'dearest' once more.
My dearest, this picture, my own memory.
Wishing this picture was reality.

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away.
And if you could see my today, I will remember you.
I will remember you
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too.

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away.
And if you could see me today, I will remember you.
I will remember you.
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too.
