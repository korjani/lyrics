See the children play the ball. See them play along the hall.
It makes me cry to see them smile.
I see the moon; I see the sky.
I see reflections in my eyes. And there's no one to share my life.
I need a life to go my way.
So ev'ry night I pray.
Just give me someone for my life.
I feel a clown. People try to play me down .
And there's one thing I never found .
The sound of love.

See the old man walk the lane. See him walk along in pain.
It makes me cry to see them smile.
I watch the moon; I watch the sky.
I see reflections in my eyes.
And there's no one to share my life.
I need a life to go my way . So ev'ry night I pray.
Just give me someone for my life.
I feel a clown. People try to play me down .
And there's one thing I never found .
The sound of love.

The sound of love .Ev'rybody loves the sound of love.
Ev'rybody loves the sound of love.
Ev'rybody loves the sound of love [keep repeating and fade]
