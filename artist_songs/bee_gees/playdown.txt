I'm not a ghost , I am a man
I only do the best I can
Believin' I will find a way
It's just a price that you must pay

For my friends , they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play
They play high and I play

I play the game , I see the light
I walk in day , you walk in night
Believe me boy, it ain't no good
In doin' what you never should

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

nah......

All my friends , they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play
