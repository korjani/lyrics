Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can

When Kitty smiles, the world stands still
I see a thousand golden daffodils
But when she cries, the world just dies
I see a million tears in Kitty's eyes

Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Ah, ah, ah ah ah

Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel
She loves to see me looking like a fool
I find a way with words I say
To be in love in such a lonely way

Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Ah, ah, ah ah ah

Now they are two and I am one
I cannot fall in love with everyone
So I must choose between the two
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you

Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Ah, ah, ah ah ah
