I.O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O.
I.O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.

You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.

She never told me why she left me
But the letter say goodbye
Now my mornings are for wond'ring
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.
I sing, I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.
I sing, I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.
I.O. I.O.
I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O. I.O. I.I.I.I.I.I.O. I.O.
