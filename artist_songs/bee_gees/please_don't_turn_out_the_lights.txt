Ev'rytime I need reality, in jeopardy of losing all of me
I just am not stronger, life don't last so long, so baby,
If you turned out the light, if you turned out the light,
Please don't turn out the light, please don't turn out the light
Turn out the lights

Baby, I don't feel too reliable
I can only do what I'm liable, but if you want to leave me
Love me and just leave me, baby;
If you turned out the light, if you turned out the light
Please don't turn out the light, please don't turn out the light
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
