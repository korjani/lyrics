All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I want to be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me

Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride

Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Desp'ratly I must keep on

Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride

La...

All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride

All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning

I saw a new morning [repeat 3 more times]
