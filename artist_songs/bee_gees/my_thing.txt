I see my dog lying under the table
I see him licking my brother's girlfriend's hand
La de da da da
La de du da de du da  de du du

I can't understand those eyes that keep staring at me
I can't understand how you do what you do to me
I keep on looking for you everywhere
I can't get used to the feeling you're giving me

Bowzey wow wowzey
Bowzey wow wowzey bow wowzey bow wowzey
du du du du
