Look at me I'm riding high
don't know what's wrong with me.
Can't you see I'm not the guy
that I pretend to be.
Though I know I will be lonely
but our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.
Ah......

The more I try the more I fail,
I'd like to run away.
But if I try you pass me by,
I know that I can't stay.
Though I know I will be lonely
but our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.
Ah...

Ah....
Though I know I will be lonely
but our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes
I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I close my eyes.
