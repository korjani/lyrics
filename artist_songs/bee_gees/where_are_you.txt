Where are you (where are you)
Night is day and day is night
Where are you (where are you)
Need you girl you're not in sight
Our love would grow , but you leave and I know
that you don't love me (where are you)
I need you girl ,you're not in sight
I told you (I told you)
I was never coming back -ah
You told me (You told me)
You would give my love the sack-ah
Now as I fly , you won't tell me goodbye
'cause you don't love me (where are you)

Now you give my love the sack-ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you (I love you)
This I think that you should know
I'll be blue (I'll be blue)
You are still 'cause I must
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
and see things my way (where are you)
You are still 'cause I must go
You are still 'cause I must
I must go (where are you )
