You and me we're both the same
In this life a lonely game
I used to be a happy man
And now I understand just what it's all about
I never had a doubt on the chance of love

As a boy I lived down here
I always saw you near
To be together was happiness
And I just can't forget the moment we first kissed
I'd like to try again on the chance of love

Yeah, on the chance of love
I'll do anything to get you by my side
On the sound of love I will love you girl
You'll be mine

All the world would then be free
An apple falls from an apple tree
You and I will be together
And you will understand when I take your hand
I'll open up the door to the chance of love
