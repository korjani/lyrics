Your lips could never show a smile.
You never tried you just put me in a file.
I never lived inside your hole , child.
I thought you needed me I never had no style.

Never say never say never again . Never say never say never again.
You said goodbye; I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again

Your eyes could never show a grin.
You never tried you just put me in a tin.
I never lived inside your hole child.
You  know I needed you . And look at the shape I'm in.
Never say never say never again .Never say never say never again .
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again .

Your lips could never show a smile.
You never tried you just put me in a file.
I never lived inside your hole child.
I thought you needed me. I never had no style.
Never say never say never again.
Never say never say never again .
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again .

Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain .
Never say never say never again.

Never never never never
Never never [fade out]
