Tell me if dreams do come true.
If so then I know that I'm losing you.
And you know the address where we live.
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive.

When do I and when do I know if there's an answer why.
I wonder if I know where I fit in.
How do I and how do I stop myself from gonna cry.
I wonder if I know where I fit in

And when do I and when do I, when do I
When do I know if I fit in
