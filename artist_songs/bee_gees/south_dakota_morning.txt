The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
My enemy can find me
If only to remind me that I'm really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known

The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I don't see my eagle anymore
Now stranger, I must kill you
You must survive, but will you
I may just beat you down, but will it even up the score
I think I saw the eagle just once more

The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I can't see the sadness in my town
So let it be my pillow for underneath your willow
Wanna go back to you though your nothing but a town
On the South Dakota grass I lay me down
