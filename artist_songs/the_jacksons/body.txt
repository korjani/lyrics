Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home

Never thought that I would hurt so bad
Ever since the day that I met you
All alone I sit 'cause I'm so sad
Don't you know this heart
It grieves for you
There you were
Holding back your love
Tryin' to make me feel real bad
'Cause your love I never had

I begged to her
(He loves you)
I needed her
(He needs you)
I told her that
(He wants you)
I want her back
(He loves you)

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Darlin', don't you wanna have some fun
Don't you know, baby
I'm the one
Just come with me
And I'll make you feel
Don't you know
Babe, this love is real
But there you were
Holding back your love
All along you're lookin' sad
But I know you're holding back

Deceiving me
(He loves you)
What is the key
(He needs you)
Do you believe in me
(He wants you)
Is it disgrace you see
(He loves you)
(Come home)

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

(Girl, I want your body)
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
(Why don't you come home with me now)
Girl, I want you
(Want your body)
(Body)
Oh baby, I need you
(Why don't you come home with me now)
Oh baby, don't you want me
(Want your body)
(Body)
Ooh girl, I need
I need you
(Why don't you come home with me now)

(Why don't you come home with me now)
(Want your body)
(Body)
(Why don't you come home with me now)

Sing it

Girl, I want
Want you body
Body
Sing it
Why don't you come home with me now
