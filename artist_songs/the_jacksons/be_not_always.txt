Always, be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in shame
Always, please be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in blame
'Cause time has made promises
Just promises

Faces, did you see their faces
Did they touch you
Have you felt such pain
To have nothing
To dream something
Then lose hoping
Is not life but lame
But time has made promises
Just promises

Mothers cry, babies die
Helplessly in arms
While rockets fly
And research lies
In progress to become
But what of men
Of flesh and blood
We turn our backs on life
How can we claim to stand for peace
When the races are in strife
Destroying life

Always, be not always
But if always
Bow our heads in shame
Always, please, please be not always
'Cause if always
Bow our heads in blame
'Cause time, time has made promises
Death promises
