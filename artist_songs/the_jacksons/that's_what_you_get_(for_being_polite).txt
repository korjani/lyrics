Jack still cries day and night
Jack's not happy with his life
He wants to do this
He wants to that
You want to be kind but ends up flat for love
For love

[Chorus:]
He tries so hard to give a lot
He wants to be what he is not
But love's not harsh and love's not bad
So what's he doing for love is so sad
He wants to be so bad
He wants to be so bad
All the time getting in
Things he can't get out
Something deep inside of him
Eatin' up the pride of him
That makes him buy things for the girls
That's what you get for being polite
For being polite

Jack still sits all alone
He lives the world that is his own
He's lost in thought of who to be
I wish to god that he would see just love
Give him love

[Chorus]

(Jack still) tryin' to make you happy but
(Jack still) tryin' to make you happy but
(Jack still) tryin'to make you happy but it's love, but it's love
(Jack still) tryin' to make you, but don't you know he cries
(Jack still) don't you know he's scared
(Jack still) it's often for his love
It's for his love
Don't you know he often cries about you
He cries about me
He cries about you (you) and me (and me)
And every little thing that's in his way
He cries about me
He cries about you (you) and me (and me)
He knows he deserves to cry

[Chorus]
