You can't say, girl, that I don't love you
Nights cryin', thinkin' of you
I don't understand your ways

They say true love is forever gladness
All that I feel is sadness
I don't understand your ways

You keep me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me so blue
You break my heart then you say
That we're through
But it's O.K.

I don't understand your ways
What have I done to deserve this madness
All that I feel is sadness

I don't understand your ways
You keep me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me and let's start anew
You break my heart, then you say that we're through

No more believin'
In every word you say
Persuasions deceiving
But I'm wise in every way
And I know 'bout your playin'
With every guy in town
So this time I'm sayin'
You won't fool me around

You get me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me blue
You break my heart, then you say that we're through
But it's O.K.
You're no good
I don't understand your ways
One more fool just to love and groove you
That's all that he wanna to do to you
I don't understand your ways

Love
