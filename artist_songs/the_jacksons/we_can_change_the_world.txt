All for one and one for all
Is what we all should be
But instead we go and fight each other
Now that wasn't meant to be
You know the sun is there
To light up the day
The night is lit by the moon
If we don't come together, my brother
It all can end very soon

It's your world now
The future is plain to see
Sing it, yeah
Sing it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give love right now
We need the harmony

Some of us have a heart of stone
And feelings cold as ice
Love can make a change in you
Take a wrong and make things right
If you only know how it was planned
For life to really be
Well, you would join in
You won't hesitate
You will help bring the harmony

God made this world
For all souls
Why, tell me why
So many obstacles
He's the one
He's the only one that knows
He judges the heart
Before He saves the soul

We can change
We can change the world
Brothers, let's unite
Come, let's make everything all right
We can change this world
Help this world

Everybody needs love
Turn it loose
Don't stop that love
You know it's time for waking up

God made this world
For all souls
Why, tell me why
So many obstacles
He's the one
He's the only one that knows
He judges the heart
Before He saves the soul

We can change
We can change the world
Brothers let's unite
Come, let's make everything all right
We can change this world
Help this world

Stop balking
Let's get walking
If you lead
All will follow
We can change this world
Help this world
To make wrong things right
It just don't happen overnight

Brothers come unite
We can make everything
Everything all right
We can change it
Help me change it
We can change
We can change the world
We can change it
Help me change it
We can change
We can change the world
