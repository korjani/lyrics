I got to find me a girl
Oh, I got to find me a girl

Somebody who
Can make all my dreams
Come true
Somebody soft and warm

I know just what I want
I've been searching everywhere
Can't seems to find her anywhere
Could it be you, could it be you
Could it be you

I got to find me a girl
Oh, I got to find me a girl

Somebody true
To make all my lonely nights
A thing of the past
Someone to make everything
All right

I got to find me a girl
Find me a girl
Find me a girl
Oh baby

Somebody who
Can make all my dreams
Come true
Somebody soft and warm
I know just what I want

I've been searching everywhere
Can't seems to find her anywhere
Could it be you, could it be you
Could it be you
