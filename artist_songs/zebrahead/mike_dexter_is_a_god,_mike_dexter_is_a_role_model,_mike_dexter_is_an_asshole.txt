No matter how hard I try
I always find a reason why
To waste my day with you
I got a list of demands and no antidote
Green thumb on my hand and some hope to float
Since then you've had a hold of me by the throat
Back alley, on the wall, the graffiti wrote
Hold on
Wait up
Enjoy the smoke
Take time
Red wine
And the levy broke
It's hard to throw away what the rush dragged in
Wanna go all the way while the record spins
Wasting away the day again
Wasting away the day
I've been wasting all the day away
I'm so close yet far away
Still I'm wasting away the day
You haunt me and you hypnotize
You write the tale of me demise
Begins and ends with you
I got a one way ticket and a fight to throw
I'm a house of cards falling like dominos
You will always be the one that I can't let go
The hieroglyphics on my arm mean take it slow
Hold on
Wait up
Enjoy the jokes
Take time
Red wine
And the moment spoke
It's hard to throw away what the rush dragged in
Wanna go all the way while the record spins
