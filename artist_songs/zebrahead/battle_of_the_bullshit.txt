You say
I'm a punchline, broken down time.
I got nothing but at least I know it's all mine.
Fight like Kung-Fu as we bleed through
scars on our bodies are reminders not to trust you.

It's an uphill war battle of the bullshit
And if less is more than more or less we're never gonna quit.

[2x]
Hate us
Brandish your loaded guns.
Burn us
Blistering than a thousand suns.
Blame us
Shame is fucking ton... we've come undone, we've come undone.

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side cause
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause
We're not alone in this war called life.

Check this shit out
Imma refuse... fucking recluse, hanging with my friends at the bottom of a tight noose.
Like an outcast, coming dead last, always up to something so you know you better think fast.

When it's battle cry, rebel yell our lungs out. 
If it's do or die, than do you know we're dying to break out?

Don't stop, that's a hell of a lie... for real, it's even one I'd buy
Can't deal, you got a crooked spine... that's fine cause I draw the line.
We see through your fake devotions going through the motions, bullshit notions
Check out the hooks and the rhymes I render, we won't back down and we won't surrender... won't surrender, we won't surrender!
