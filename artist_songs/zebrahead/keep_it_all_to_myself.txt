So...

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh...

I'm kinda wasted,
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta chase it,
I guess I'll do my best to fake it from now on.

I'm medicated,
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta take it,
I guess I'll try to suffocate it from now on.

I'm sick of everything and everyone I know,
I'm sick and tired, but I can't let it show
So, ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself, yeah!
Ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself!

I'm kinda jaded,
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta change it,
I guess I'll do my best to make it from now on.

I'm aggravated,
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta hate it,
I guess I'll try to just forget it from now on.

I'm sick of everything and everyone I know,
I'm sick and tired, but I can't let it show
So, ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself, yeah!
Ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself!

One, two,
What to do? Fucked up to the letter,
Three, Four,
Liquor store, Drink until you're better,
Four, Five,
Nosedive, take another header.

I'll keep it to myself, I'll keep it to myself.

Five, four,
Civil war, me, myself and I,
Three, two,
Follow through, and live another lie,
Two, one,
Get your gun, two shots in the sky.

I'll keep it to myself, I'll keep it to myself.

I'm sick of everything and everyone I know,
I'm sick and tired, but I can't let it show
So, ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself, yeah!
Ohh I keep it to myself, myself,
Keep it to myself!

I'm sick of everything and everyone I know,
Myself, keep it to myself.
I'm sick and tired but I can't let it show,
Myself, keep it to myself.

So, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh...
