Might as well burn the club down, tonight
Kill me with the beat til daylight
Lady get hot, I'mma stay inside
Til death do we party, with the music I die

Pour a little more into your cup
The sweeter the juice
The better your luck
Let's get loud as we celebrate life
Til death do we party, with the music I die

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
So hot y'all the music
So loud, I don't know what to do with it

Over my body like I winning a fight
Like dancin' with the devil
I could do this all night
Wearing all black
Like a brand new bride
Til death do we party, with the music I die

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
So hot y'all the music
So loud, I don't know what to do with it

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
I really don't care
I'mma go all night
Til death do we party, with the music I die

Woaah woaahh woahhh

With the music, release, I will play
With the music, we're all born again
With the music we die
With the music we fight
We surrender ourselves
It's now

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
So hot y'all the music
So loud, I don't know what to do with it

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
I really don't care
I'mma go all night
Til death do we party, with the music I die
