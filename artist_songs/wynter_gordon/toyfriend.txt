See you looking
Yeah, you looking over my way
I wanna leash you up
And put you into my cage
Teach you how to touch me baby
How to say my name
Bet you never had nobody to give 
It to you this way

I wanna put you in my closet
I wanna play till I'm exhausted
Come come baby come be my 
Toyfriend let me play with you
Come come baby come be my
Toyfriend till I'm through with you

Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
BOUNCE!

Ain't got to dress you up
And put you on display
Rather keep you in my back house
I TURN YOU ON TURN YOU ON
IN SO MANY WAYS
AND I DON'T EVER HAVE TO USE NO BATTERIES!

I wanna put you in my closet
I wanna play till I'm exhausted
Come come baby come be my Toyfriend
Let me play with you
Come come baby come be my
Toyfriend till I'm through with you
BOUNCE!

Let me play
Let me play
Let me play
Let me play
Let me play
BOUNCE!

Come come baby come be my Toyfriend
Let me play with you
Come come baby come be my
Toyfriend till I'm through with you

Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you

Come come baby come be my 
Toyfriend let me play with you
Come come baby come be my
Toyfriend till I'm through with you
