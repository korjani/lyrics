With all the noise above
He tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day has just begun

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

The diamond cuts her eye
The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now, they hear it loud

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

I'm ok, I'm alright
I was out late last night
Empty world, empty world
I will wait one more night
