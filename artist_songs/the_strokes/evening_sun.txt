They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Encourage and derange you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna make your heart in

Break you heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer, miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do nothing? Me too

All actors they're pretending and singers they will sometimes lie
Oh kids are always honest 'cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
You're the pretty smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen

In the evening sun
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
