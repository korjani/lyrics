It was all just a dream, oh no
Yet I wish it was real
All my pets they were there and they smiled
Take a shit, it was fine

Everybody so inviting
They've got it in for me I know
It's not that I don't really love you
It's just that I don't really know
The hateful things you think you want to say
Time will turn them into jokes, yup

Yes, it was all just a dream, oh no
Was it real? I don't know I hope so

Here we go, can I play? Can I watch?
You would like one more night in your life
I saw words in your star and I cussed
It goes fast, I got sunk every shot

Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
'Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care

This whole life
Is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up and I wait and I fall
I will call you up one day
Overjoyed in a case

First time around, second take so long
Third time's a charm, second falls
Five days to rehearse, six American work
Seven is in a scale, eight circum change
Nine events a case, ten is you and friend
Eleven seconds there because twelve make it go large
