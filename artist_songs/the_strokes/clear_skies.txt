Knowing you
You'll wait for clear skies
To tell us how changes come about
With the sunlight
So we'll count every drop that falls
While you throw us some old line
This will pass, this will pass

And I'm spending your time
Wasting your time
You're with all you've ever wanted
And I'm spending your time
Wasting your time
You're with all you've ever wanted
