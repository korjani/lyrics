Say a prayer now, don't be scared now
You don't want trouble, well we might get some
We might get some, it's troublesome
But don't you worry, you can't help me

Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies

First you're worried, then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same
That's impossible, before I let you go, let me look at you
Don't you worry, you will help me

Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies

Oh yes I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
Oh yes I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
You're mine
