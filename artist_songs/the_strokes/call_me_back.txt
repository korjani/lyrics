Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late

I look for you
And you look for me
Wooah, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you

Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Waking is so much fun to do.
(Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party, yeah
(Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you)
