I went asleep last night 
Tired from the fight 
I've been fighting for tomorrow 
All my life 
Yea I woke up this morning 
Feeling brand new 
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
Has finally came true 

It's a new day 
It's a new day 
It's a new day 
It's a new day 
It's a new day 

It's been a long time coming 
Up the mountain kept runnin' 
Souls of freedom kept hummin' 
Channeling Harriet Tubman 

Kennedy, Lincoln, and King 
We gotta maninvest in that dream 
It feels like we're swimming upstream 
It feels like we're stuck inbetween 
A rock and a hard place, 
We've been through the heartaches 
And lived through the darkest days 

If you and I made it this far, 
Well then hey, we can make it all the way 
And they said no we can't 
And we said yes we can 
Remember it's you and me together 

I woke up this morning 
Feeling alright 
I've been fightin' for tomorrow 
All my life 
Yea, I woke up this morning 
Feeling brand new 
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
Has finally came true 

It's a new day 
(it's a new day) 
It's a new day 
(it's a new day) 
It's a new day 
It's a new day! 

It's been a long time waitin' 
Waiting for this moment 
It's been a long time praying 
Praying for this moment 

We hope for this moment 
And now that we own it 
For life I ma hold it 
And I won’t let it go 

It's for fathers, our brothers, 
Our friends who fought for freedom 
Our sisters, our mothers, 
Who died for us to be in this moment 

Stop and cherish this moment 
Stop and cherish this time 

It's time for unity 
For us and we 
That's you and me together 

I woke up this morning 
Feeling brand new 
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
Have finally came true 
Yea, I woke up this morning 
Feeling alright 

'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing 
And the soldiers weren't fighting 
For nothing 
No, Martin wasn't dreaming for nothing 
And Lincoln didn't change it for nothing 
And children weren't crying for nothing 

It's a new day 
It's a new day 
A new day 
It's a new day 
It's a new day!
