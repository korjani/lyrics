Honey, lookin' good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body outta control
She 24, she could be a model
So beautiful, all so natural
Mama lookin' good from her head to her feet
She 44, but she still lookin' sweet
And you could tell her daughter ain't even at a peak
Cause her mama lookin' so hot, packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank yo mama
She made ya steamin' like a sauna
Look out, look out here she come now 
Look out, look out here she come 

[Chorus:]

Girl, yo beauty is a sensation
You sittin' in the temptation
I never knew a girl could shine like the sun
You betta thank ya mama, cause girl you the one
We should have a date of celebration
Celebratin' God's best creation

Maybe cause your blessed with the beautiful buns
Maybe cause your beauty keep the dudes unsprung
Wonderin' just where you got that from, from, f-from...
