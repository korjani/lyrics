All night long, all night long

My future looks brighter in your eyes
So if I ever realize, I don't blame the fire, you're mine
And we go all night long, all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter in your eyes

I'm lookin' forward, you're lookin' back
Help me pick out our next adventure on the map
Let's take it all in, let's catch a vibe
You give me feelings that I only reach when high
So bae, I'll make it easy, I'll make you mine
A little trouble in my heart, it makes you glad
You got me always, champagne and wine
But even when I sleep, somehow you rule my mind
Oh lately

My future looks brighter in your eyes
So if I ever realize, I don't blame the fire, you're mine
And we go all night long, all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter in your eyes

Oh, the start, you'll be there in the end
And take me back again
You're the perfect end
