There's no light, no light in the sky
And it gets so cold when she leaves my side
Maybe she's the light, the light in my eyes
'Cause everything looks old and tired when she leaves my side

I know, I know, I know, I know you got to leave
So I'll bite my tongue until that fucker bleeds
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I can be alright
But see, you set my sun, so here comes the night
Here comes the night, here comes the night
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I can be alright
Here comes the night, here comes the
Here comes the night

There's no light, no light in the sky
And it gets so cold when she leaves my side
Maybe she's the light, the light in my eyes
'Cause everything looks old and tired when she leaves my side

I know, I know, I know, I know you got to leave
So I'll bite my tongue until that fucker bleeds
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I can be alright
But see, you set my sun, so here comes the night
Here comes the night, here comes the night
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I can be alright
Here comes the night, here comes the
Here comes the night
