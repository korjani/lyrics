[R. Kelly:]
I know I've got no business here
In this club while you are there
Take these shots to numb the pain
But that don't help, the scar's still there
Don't you ever think about it?
I know you gotta think about it
A love that's so undoubting
How can we ever live without it?

When it's real, it's worth fighting for
Baby, it's worth dying for
And I won't let you down
Baby girl, I'm on the next flight out

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
I just wanna love you

[Breakdown - DJ Snake]

[R. Kelly:]
No one said this would be easy
There's a chance we might get hurt
Baby, love is like an ocean
Well I wanna dive in head first
That means no more pretending
I need you like the air I breathe in
Our love is a new religion
'Cause it's everything that I believe in

When it's real, it's worth fighting for
Baby, it's worth dying for
And I won't let you down
Baby girl, I'm on the next flight out

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
I just wanna love you

[Breakdown - DJ Snake]

[R. Kelly:]
Yeah yeah, I'm coming back for it
That's mine and you know it
Like a shot at the buzzer, we can't blow it
There's a key to my soul and you hold it
You stole it, it's yours, yeah yeah
Who love you like I do?
Go into the sun, come up like I do?
Girl, smiling 'cause you know this shit true
You know that shit true
Do you believe in second chances
Fairytales and some romances
Like I do?
'Cause baby, I know, listen
Baby, I won't
Go through this thing called life
Without you by my side

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
