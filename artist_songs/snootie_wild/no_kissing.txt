[Hook: Snootie Wild]
We don't do no kissing, no kissing, no kissing
We don't do no kissing, no kissing, no kissing
Don't know where yo' mouth be, but I know where it going, it going
And I know this ain't yo' first time, no
And I know this ain't yo' first time, no
So we don't do no kissing, no kissing, no kissing
We don't do no kissing, no kissing, no kissing

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
We don't do no kissing, no kissing, you silly
And I know your secret, you fucking the city
Bitch you know you going, and I know you blowing
Turning tricks fo' packs, you ratchet, no moral
See you know your fine, blowing niggas minds, but you won't blow mine
You tripping, stop geeking
All your friends they jocking, cuz I rock with Gotti
Make them hoes retarded, we creepin', we creepin'
First I need yo' soul, then you bow down low
Now I need yo' dough
No, I been told you no
Bitch yo' face to close

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Zed Zilla]
We don't do no kissing, can't even blow a kiss my way
Don't even play in text messages, can't leave me no kissy face
Yo' mouth been so messy, state to state with that face
Lord, please send her a blessing, she stay on her knees all day, anyway
I heard you stay with yo' ex, straight sucking dick
Heard you straight do anything for a check
I heard a lil secret 'bout all of them bitches you be with lil bitch, and I could care less
Y'all hoes a mess, suck dick for rent
You hoes stay hollerin' bout "my head the best!"
You got to be giving me the best Superhead impression you got for me to be impressed
I had a bitch finesse me
Come up, tried to kiss me
Couldn't take that chance, I don't know where you been, bitch yo' mouth risky
I don't do no kissing, I can't take that chance
She said, "That's fucked up, all I been doing is sucking dick, nigga since we been friends!"
