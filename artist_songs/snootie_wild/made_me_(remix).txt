[Verse 1 - Jeremih:]
Catch me grinding for that platinum, Late Nights on the way
I'm from Chi-Town she from Brooklyn condo in La
Tell my singles throwing singles, ass up in rotation
Glasses in the air, it's a celebration
TLC catch me creeping, I ain't cuffing, no police
Bumping 12 Play in my straight A, she remind me of my jeep
I hit his bitch, I act like shaggy, I'm like "No, it wasn't me."
Beat the pussy, 808, I'm Dr.Dre when in them sheets
Think my bank account on protein, how my pockets swole' up
Trynna' stack my money high, taller than a grown up
Ladies wanna' have my babies, they gon' low like limbo
Like for real, what's the deal, whipping out my demo
I've been tweaking off patron, gone off the mascato
Blowing smoke I'm on probably cost a car note
Know you got a man, but know that shit don't phase me
Looked up in the mirror, that's that shit that made me

[Hook - K Camp:]
Late night catch me creeping
With yo damn old lady
Serving, swerving on the highway
And I'm doing bout' 80
I can see them haters talking
But it do not phase me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
(Aye aye aye)

[Verse 2 - Snootie Wild:]
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
I done ate up out that mud
And it taste like gravy
All I try to do is flip the 4 into a baby
All I wanna do is flip the 4 to feed my babies
See I know these niggas watchin'
And these niggas hate me
Cause I came from nothing nigga
Now they see this kid done made it
See me pulling in the projects in that nihilator
See yo' eye candy I eat her like a now and later
Choppa choppa, a nigga dead and make him peculator
Real choppin' down the block just like a alligator
All this kush done turned my eye red like I'm terminator
Holla' at amigo, Cali plug a elevate ya

[Hook - K Camp]

[Verse 3 - Lil' Boosie:]
I done got it out the mud, that's that shit that made me
Ramen noodles, sugar water, similac baby
Small clubs make niggas cocaine crazy
I'm telling you "Nah, this ain't a place you wanna raise yo' baby"
Late night getting faded, no license registrations
Gon' fuck that ho Keshia with a fine ass and good mouth
And after that Wi-Fi them eggs and bacon
Swerving serving heading home, trynna' see my babies
Always said I'm gon' ball, now I'm going crazy
Jesus piece look like a four year old baby
God saved me, real music paid me for being a real nigga made me
And we G
