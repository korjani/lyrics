[Hook 2x: Snootie Wild]
Aye yayo
All I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
Aye yayo
Yea I just said yayo
Taste just like candy cane but whiter then that pure snow
And why you trying to play me and you know you selling wappo
When you with the boss, then I got to say so
Aye oh no, he hit licks like oh no
Counting all this mula paper you can call it mucho
Cause I be rockin' all this paper moving weight like macho
I be eatin' nacho, cheese, guapo
Aye vato, holla at amigo
And he gone get them bricks and wrap them tighter then burritos
I let him know, I need it for the low and need it pronto
He gone ship them off torpedo

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Yayo
All I know is yayo
Trapp been doing good, I'm serving junkies out the peep hole
Laws oh no
Serve you that's a no go
But since you niggas actors I might shoot like some b-roll
I got killas on my payroll
No sleep, I'm on NoDoz
On my Paul wall stuff, I'm tippin with that .44
Mister thousand eight grams
Mister prices they to high for me
I love all my young niggas
I know they'll die for me
Bust five for me
Cocaine in my county
Kush truck that loud weed
I don't smoke
Blow a pound for me
Yayo
Car's white like mayo
Seat white like whip cream
Rims look like marshmallows

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Mota coco yayo
Dinero queso peso

My trusty en fuego
Got shooters on my roof
Swear they got super grande wuebos
They shoot because I say so
Policia on my payroll
Aye si mi amigo se que pasa contigo
Y si todo tranquilo
