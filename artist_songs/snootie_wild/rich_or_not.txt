Richer or not, richer or not
They tryin', they tryin', they tryin' to knock me straight off the top
Look at the charts
I'm knocking these niggas out spots
Richer or not
If we get richer or not!

I'm knocking these niggas out spots
Number one song, sit in the charts
Still in the slums, stove and a pot
Keep me a Glock with a rich nigga guap
They try, they try, they try, they try but nigga you not
Really you can't, just need to stop
Martin Luther King, buy me a dream
Vision my mountain, straight to the top
Fuck Hollywood, fuck being a star
Richer or not
Keeping it trill
First with myself then with my squad
Tell me the truth, is you snitching or not?
Fuck the world!
Real, you niggas are not

Richer or not, richer or not
They tryin', they tryin', they tryin' to knock me straight off the top
Look at the charts
I'm knocking these niggas out spots
Richer or not
If we get richer or not!

I used to be broke as fuck
Nigga, not no more!
All I know is go, in the sky I soar like an eagle
Getting my dough, only Lord knows what I've done
Penitentiary chances, kick in the door and I'm blastin'
Never no question I'm asking
Servin' the fuck up with ratchets
Rocks in my sock with a Glock
Beat to the block 'fore the cop
'Bout to get richer, richer or not
I used to be broke as fuck
Nigga, not no more!
All I know is go, in the sky I soar like an eagle
Getting my dough
My cheese is nacho, don't forget guap!

Richer or not, richer or not
They tryin', they tryin', they tryin' to knock me straight off the top
Look at the charts
I'm knocking these niggas out spots
Richer or not
If we get richer or not!
