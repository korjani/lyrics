Shouldn't we two be together?
You know what I mean
To be with you is something like a dream (You know what I mean)
And if you want me to
I'll bring sunshine to you only

You better stop, take a look about
You know what I mean
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
Then you'd know the reason why
I would love to say "I do" then say
Goodbye and let you go forever
Wouldn't we two be together?

Can't you see (Why can't you see?)
That I want you for me forever?
Wouldn't we two be together?

Do you know what I mean?
Can't you read in between the lines?
Sometimes I'm talking, and it doesn't seem too clear
But if you have to know
I'm in love, if only you know what I mean

Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
