We walked hand in hand from the patch
Playing in the middle of the city
Down the street we walked westerly
Wind breezin' through her hair pretty

My love in the city is good, so good
When things around me slow down, slow down
I think about my love in the city, in the city
I think about my love

I know she waits for me nervously
Trying to keep busy in the city
Sleeping in her bed patiently
Waiting for me, come home with love to me

My love in the city is good, so good
When things around me slow down, slow down
I think about my love in the city, in the city
I think about my love in the city, in the city
I think about my love in the city
