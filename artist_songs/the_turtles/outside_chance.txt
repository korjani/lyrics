You can try to please me
But it won't be easy
Stone walls surround me
I'm surprised that you even found me

And you don't stand an outside chance
(you don't stand an outside chance)
You don't stand an outside chance
But you can try

Whatever you do girl
You know you can't get through girl
Can't bring me down
Hang me up or even hang around

And you don't stand an outside chance
(you don't stand an outside chance)
You don't stand an outside chance
But you can try

I know you think you'll get me
I'm only flesh and bone
But you may as well forget me
'Cause my heart is stone
You better leave me alone

You can try to please me
But it won't be easy
Stone walls surround me
I'm surprised that you even found me

And you don't stand an outside chance
(you don't stand an outside chance)
You don't stand an outside chance
But you can try

Stand an outside chance
