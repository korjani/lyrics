Mornin', mornin' glory
If you'd like to know where was I last night
Well, I saw a girl with a boy in her eye
And she's so outta sight

She's my girl
And that's where I was last night
Off in a dream

She's my girl
I took her away last night
Went for a ride
Off in the sky, that's where I was last night

I just come back to tell ya
There's a little bit of heaven underneath the apple tree
And every time I see you with that smile upon your face
There's a little bit there for me

And she's my girl
And that's where I was last night
Went for a ride

She's my girl
I took her away last night
We went for a ride
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Off in the sky

She's my girl
I took her away last night
Off in the sky
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high
Off in the sky, that's where I was last night

My girl
I took her away last night
We went for a ride
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high
My girl
I took her away last night
Off in the sky
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high
