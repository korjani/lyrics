I looked at your face, is that the face I love?
It's been a long time since I've seen you
You've got a lovely place, the kids must send their love
We stood there lonely, baby, without you

And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl
When you walk through my door, you'll be home

I was so afraid I almost turned away
But you know I need somebody to cling to
I looked at your face, I love you anyway
It's been a long time since I've seen you

And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl
When you walk through my door, you'll be home

And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl
When you walk through my door, you'll be home

And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
