Your ma said you cried in your sleep last night
Your ma said you cried in your sleep last night
Should have seen the look in her eye
I had to tell her some little white lies
I know I haven't been so true to you
I know I haven't been so true to you
Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry no more
Ain't gonna be the way it was before
Oh, I love you - oh, I love you
Let me kiss you - let me hold you tight
Oh, I love you - oh, I love you so much
My ma said I cried, my ma said I cried
My ma said I cried in my sleep last night
All the other guys got their eyes on you
All the other guys got their eyes on you
I'm comin' home, comin' home, comin' home for sure
Ain't gonna be the way it was before
Oh, I love you - oh, I love you
Let me kiss you - let me hold you tight
Oh, I love you - oh, I love you
I need you so much, and my ma said I cried
My ma said I cried, my ma said I cried
My ma said I cried in my sleep last night
Said hey hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat - gonna make you groove
Cause I love you - I love you
Oh oh, child - said the way you swing
Gonna make you burn - gonna make you sting
'Cause I love - 'cause I love you so much
And my ma said I cried, my ma said I cried
My ma said I cried in my sleep last night
