Where the crane flies through the marshes
And the turtles sun their shells
Where the water rat goes swimmin'
That's where my swamp girl dwells

Where the sunlight never wanders
And the moonlight never falls
Where the water's black with the devil's track
That's where my swamp girl calls

What did she say there
The girl with the golden hair
To make me follow her down there
How did she look when she took me by the hand

Tonight her hair will float in the water
And the gold will no longer shine
It will spread like a fan in the water
While she makes a mysterious sign
I have seen that sign before

Her eyes aren't like the whippoorwill
And her eyes aren't like the frog
Her eyes are like the damned bat
Stretchin' in the dawn

I have seen her face in the water
And the chilling look in her eyes
And if you see her, then you must flee her
Never follow where disillusion lies

Or will you go to the girl with the golden hair
Down there where her work is done
Will you embrace the night
And turn your back on the sun

She'll say its better there in the water
Where it's cool and calm and serene
She will call you to come to the water
To a world made of emerald green
I have heard that call before

I can hear it when I'm teary
I can hear it when I'm old
I can hear it when the joy of living
Seems to have lost its glow

For my Swamp Girl lives inside of me
And she leaves me pale and wan
She dares me, she tears me
Like paper dolls are torn

Calling "Come to the deep
Where your sleep is without a dream"
(Come to the deep where your sleep is without a dream)
Calling.... (Come....)
