No talkin, just sexin, just sexin yeah! ohh. ohh
All I wanna do is sex on you [x4]
I act all crazy girl when I get inside of you. (inside of you) [x3]
There ain't no ground rules for what I'd like to do [x4]
And I'll be puttin it down movin around, goin half on ya baby.
Love makin that thing talkin smash, never lazy.
Long time on my mind, girl driving that thing, crazy.
As I'm sexin on you girl.

[Chorus:]
Ain't no room for talking, close mouth session
Girl let your body listen. (Body listen.)
Girl I just love sexin on you, sexin on you, sexin on, sexin on you girl.
It's all I wanna do. do. it's all I wanna do, sexin on you.

Look at you shakin you can't control what you do.
Licken so much it's like we swimmin in a pool.
Focus when we out, got you moaning calling me daddy
That thing ridin so good it reminds me of my caddy.
That slow grow of the jaw girl got your buck in heavy.
Uhh, I just wanna sex you down.

[Chorus:]
Ain't no room for talking, close mouth sesion.
Girl let your boddy listen. (Body Listen)
Girl I just love sexin on you, sexin on, sexin on you, sexin on you,
Sexin on you girl.
Ohh ohh ohh
It's all I wanna do. do. do. doo.
It's all I wanna do, sexin on you.
