[Intro]
On Everything
You know I hurt you when I lied to you
So bogus Baby
Naw you didn't deserve that
On everything
I never meant to hurt you
You was the best thing that ever happened to me
I'm sorry
On everything

Aye
Making up excuses
(excuses)
You could tell that I was lying right to your face

If you could find it in your heart to give me just one more chance

Only if you let me back in... I promise
