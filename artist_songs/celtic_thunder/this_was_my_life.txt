I have loved, and I have lived
And I have had my wild romances
I've taken all that life can give
And taken my fair share of chances

It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this is my life 

I've known just how it is to win
And I have felt the pain of losing
Some paths I chose would end in tears
But they were all of my own choosing

It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this is my life

I've known contentment
In a woman's arms
And felt the warmth of her devotion
And I've known heartache
And a dark despair
That was as deep as any ocean

But, we get the strength to carry on
And build a life of our own making
We thank the Lord for each new day
And for every breath that we are taking

It's a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life

I've known contentment
In a woman's arms
And felt the warmth of her devotion
And I've known heartache
And a dark despair
That was as deep as any ocean

And looking back on all the years
The loves, the sweetness, and the sorrow
Have made me what I am today
And I'd do it all again tomorrow

It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life

We can't deny life
How it flies by, life
And I thank God that this was my life
