You're strutting through the town like you're slinging a gun 
Just a small-town dude with a big city attitude 
Honey are you looking for some trouble tonight? 
Well, alright 

You think you're so bad drive the women folk wild 
Shoot 'em all down with a flash of your pearly smile 
Honey, but you met your match tonight 
Oh, that's right 

You think you'll knock me off my feet 'til I'm flat on the floor 
'Til my heart is crying Indian and I'm begging for more 
So come on baby 
Come on baby 
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for 

If you can give it 
I can take it 
Cause if this heart is gonna break, its gonna take a lot to break it 
I know tonight somebody is gonna win the fight 

So if you're so tough 
Come on and prove it 
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it 
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames 
Just like Jesse James 

You break the laws of love in the name of desire 
Take ten steps back 
Cause I'm ready baby 
Aim and fire 
Baby, there's nowhere you're gonna run tonight 
Oh, that's right 

Well, you've had your way with love, but its the end of the day 
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away 

So come on baby 
Come on baby 
Come on baby 
Come on 

If you can give it 
I can take it 
Cause if this heart is gonna break, its gonna take a lot to break it 
I know tonight somebody is gonna win the fight 

So if you're so tough 
Come on and prove it 
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it 
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames 
Just like Jesse James 
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames 
Just like Jesse James
