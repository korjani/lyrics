Now I've heard there was a secret chord 
That David played, and it pleased the Lord 
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
It goes like this 
The fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall, the major lift 
The baffled king composing Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you to her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

Maybe there's a God above 
But all I've ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew ya 
It's not a cry that you hear at night 
It's not someone who has seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
