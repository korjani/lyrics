Two girls for every boy

I bought a pretty cool wagon and they call it a Woodie
(Surf City, here we come)
You know it ain't very cherry, it's an oldie but a goody
(Surf City, here we come)
Well it ain't got a backseat or a rear window
but it still gets me where I want to go

And we're goin' to Surf City 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Yeah, we're goin' to Surf City 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun now
Two girls for every boy
Two girls for every-

Well, she got her daddy's car 
And she cruises through the hamburger stand now
(Hamburger stand now, the hamburger stand)
Seems she forgot all about 
The library like she told her old man now
(Told her old man now, she told her old man)
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now
(Fast as she can now, as fast as she can)
And she'll have fun, fun, fun 'till her daddy takes the T-Bird away
And she'll have fun, fun, fun 'till her daddy takes the T-Bird away

If everybody had an ocean
Across the U. S. of A.
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californ-i-a
You'd see 'em wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy, bushy blond hairdo
A-surfin' U.S.A.

You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Ventura County line
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestles
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Australia's Narrabeen
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
All over Manhattan
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
And down Deheny way
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Everybody gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.

(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the boys we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A.
