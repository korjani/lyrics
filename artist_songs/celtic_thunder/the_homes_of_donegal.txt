I just dropped in to see you all 
I'll only stay awhile 
I want to hear how you're getting on 
I want to see you smile 
I'm happy to be back again 
And greet you big and small 
For there's no place else on this earth quite like 
The homes of Donegal 

I long to see your smiling children 
Standing by the door 
The kettle boiling on the hearth 
As I walked up the floor 
And then to see a waiting for me 
Travellers one and all 
For your heart's alive in your mountain size 
In the homes of Donegal 

I like to lie, lie along with you 
While away at night 
With fairy lore and tales of yore 
Beside the surf fire bright 
And then to see laid out for me 
A shake-down by the wall 
For there's rest for weary wanderers 
In the homes of Donegal 

Donegal, queen of all 
Donegal, queen of all
