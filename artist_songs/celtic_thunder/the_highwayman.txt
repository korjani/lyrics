Who is this stranger
Who breaks ev'ry rule?
The Hightwayman.

He isn't a rogue, and he isn't a fool.
The Highwayman.

He is dashing and daring
The devil may care
The Highwayman.

With a glint in his eye,
And the wind in his hair
The Highwayman.

Who is the Highwayman?
Who is the Highwayman?

He's rough, but he's handsome,
He's gentle but strong,
The Highwayman.

They say he's a nobleman
Who has gone wrong,
The Highwayman.

He'll take all your jewels,
But do it with style,
The Highwayman.

As he pockets your diamonds
He'll flash you a smile,
The Highwayman.

Who is the Highwayman?
Who is the Highwayman?

I've never known anyone like him,
He's like no one that I've ever met.
How easy he'll be to remember
How hard he will be to forget.

He's stolen for Princes,
He's stolen form Earls,
The Highwayman.

But his greatest pleasure
Is stealing from girls,
The Highwayman.

You'll feel empty inside
When you see him depart,
The Highwayman.

You may not realize
But he's stolen your heart,
The Highwayman.

Who is the Highwayman?
