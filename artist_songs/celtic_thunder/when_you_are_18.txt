When you are eighteen,
You're a man who is ready,
Who is strong and who's steady,
You know what I mean?
When you are eighteen,
Then you should be respected,
And you don't need protected,
When you are eighteen.

When you are eighteen,
You are braver and bolder
Than that crowd who are older,
You know what I mean?
'Cos when you are eighteen,
With all those years to prepare you,
There's nothing can scare you,
When you are eighteen.

I'm ready to travel,
To follow my star
To the places I've been dreaming of.
I'm ready for living;
I'm ready for life
And I know that I'm ready for love…

But when you are eighteen
They say "Love's complicated
And so over-rated",
You know what I mean?
When you are eighteen,
They say "Wait, and don't worry",
And "Hey! What's your hurry
'Cos you're only eighteen".

I'm ready to travel,
To follow my star
To the places I've been dreaming of.
I'm ready for living;
I'm ready for life
And I know that I'm ready for love…

When you are eighteen,
With the world all around you,
It can sometimes astound you,
You know what I mean?
Just how little they know, ha,
All those cowboys and chancers,
I've got more of the answers….
And I'm only eighteen.
