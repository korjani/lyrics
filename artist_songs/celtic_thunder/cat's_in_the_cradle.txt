My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son.
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play.
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son.
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad.
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad.
You know we’ll have a good time then.”
