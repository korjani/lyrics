Steal away, let's steal away,
No reason left to stay.
For me and you,
Let's start anew,
And darlin' steal away.

Ooooh, ooooh

Let's steal away and chase our dream,
And hope they never find us.
The deary days, the empty nights,
We'll leave them all behind us.

Ooooh, aaaaah

Steal away, let's steal away
No reason left to stay.
For me and you,
Let's start anew,
And darlin' steal away.

Oooooh.

We'll leave with just our memories,
And make a new beginning.
We have to choose,
To win or lose,
And it's time we started winning.

Mmmmm, aaaaah

Steal away, let's steal away,
No reason left to stay.
For me and you,
Let's start anew,
And darlin' steal away.
Steal away, let's steal away,
No reason left to stay.
For me and you,
Let's start anew,
And darlin' steal away.
