Happy birthday sweet sixteen 
Tonight's the night, 
I've waited for 
Because you're not a baby any more 
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen 
Happy birthday sweet sixteen 
What happened to that funny face? 
My Little tomboy now wears satin and lace 
I can't believe my eyes 
You're just a teenage dream 
Happy birthday sweet sixteen 
When you were only six, I was your big brother 
Then when you were ten we didn't like each other 
When you were thirteen, you were my funny valentine 
But since you've grown up the future is sown up 
From now on you're gonna be mine 
So, if I should smile with sweet surprise 
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes 
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen 
Happy birthday sweet sixteen
