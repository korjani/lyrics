Everybody needs a little time away 
I heard her say 
From each other. 
Even lovers need a holiday 
Far away from each other. 

Hold me now 
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. 
I just want you to stay. 
After all that we've been through 
I will make it up to you 
I promise to. 
After all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go. 

I couldn't stand being kept away 
Not for a day 
From your body. 
Wouldn't want to be swept away 
Far away 
From the one that i love. 

Hold me now 
Its hard for me to say I'm sorry. 
I just want you know. 

Hold me now 
I really want to tell you I'm sorry. 
I could never let you go. 
After all that weve been through 
I will make it up to you. 
I promise to. 
After all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go. 

After all that we've been through 
I will make it up to you. 
I promise to. 
After all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go. 

After all that we've been through 
I will make it up to you 
I peromise to. 
I do.
