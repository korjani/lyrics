[Chorus]
Home, home, home from the sea 
Angels of mercy, answer our plea 
And carry us home, home, home from the sea 
Carry us safely home from the sea. 

On a cold winters night 
With a storm at its height 
The lifeboat answered the call. 
They pitched and they tossed 
Till we thought they were lost 
As we watched from the harbor wall. 
Though the night was pitch black, 
There was no turning back, 
For someone was waiting out there, 
But each volunteer 
Had to live with his fear 
As they joined in a silent prayer. 

[Repeat Chorus] 

As they battled their way 
Past the mouth of the bay, 
It was blowing like never before. 
As they gallantly fought, 
Every one of them thought 
Of loved ones back on the shore. 
Then a flicker of light 
And they knew they were right. 
There she was on the crest of a wave. 
She's an old fishing boat 
And she's barely afloat. 
Please God, there are souls we can save. 

[Chorus]

And back in the town 
In a street that runs down 
To the sea and the harbor wall, 
They'd gathered in pairs 
At the foot of the stairs 
To wait or the radio call. 
And just before dawn 
When all hope had gone 
Came a hush and a faraway sound. 
'Twas the coxswain he roared 
All survivors on board 
Thank God and we're homeward bound. 

[Chorus]
