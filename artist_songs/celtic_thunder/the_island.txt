They say the skies of Lebanon are burning
Those mighty cedars bleedin' in the heat
They're showing pictures on the television
Women and children dying in the street
And we're still at it in our own place
Still tryin' to reach the future through the past
Still tryin' to carve tomorrow from a tombstone...

But Hey! Don't listen to me! this wasn't meant to be no sad song .
We've heard too much of that before
Right now I only want to be here with you 
'Till the morning dew comes falling And I wanna take you to the island 
Trace your footprints in the sand 
And in the evening when the sun goes down 
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean

They're raising banners over by the markets 
Whitewashing slogans on the shipyard walls 
Witchdoctors praying for a mighty showdown 
No way our holy flag is gonna' fall 
Up here we sacrifice our children 
To feed the worn-out dreams of yesterday 
And teach them dying will lead us into glory...

But Hey! Don't listen to me! 'cos this wasn't meant to be no sad song .
I've sung too much of that before 
Right now I only want to be here with you 
Till the morning dew comes falling I wanna take you to the island 
And trace your footprints in the sand 
And in the evening when there's no one around 
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean

Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story 
And I know this peace and love's just copping out 
And I guess these young boys dying in the ditches 
Is just what being free is all about 
And how this twisted wreckage down on main street 
Will bring us all together in the end 
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom... 
Freedom...
Freedom
