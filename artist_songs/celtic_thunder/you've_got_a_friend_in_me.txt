You’ve got a friend in me
You’ve got a friend in me

When the road looks rough ahead
And you’re miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you’ve got a friend in me
Yeah, you’ve got a friend in me

You’ve got a friend in me
You’ve got a friend in me

You’ve got troubles, well, I’ve got ‘em too
There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you
We stick together and we see it through
‘Cause you’ve got a friend in me
Yeah, you’ve got a friend in me

Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger, too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do.
It’s me and you, boy!

And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You’re gonna see
It’s our destiny
You’ve got a friend in me

Oh boy!
Yeah, you’ve got a friend in me

That’s right!
Yeah, you’ve got a friend in me
