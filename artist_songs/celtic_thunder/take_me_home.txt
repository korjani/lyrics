[Ryan]
I sit here thinking 
As the sun is sinking 
Over the mountain 
And the dry, dusty ground 

[Damian]
As the night is falling 
I start recalling 
The nights 
In my own town 

[Keith]
I see the faces 
In familiar places 
I hear the music 
That they played way back then 

[Paul]
My heart rejoices 
As I hear the voices 
Calling me 
Home again 

[Chorus - All]
Home 
Oh take me home 
Oh to the people 
I left behind 
Oh to the love 
I know I'll find 
Oooh take me home 

[George]
As the sky is burning 
My mind is turning 
To the cold winter evenings 
By my own fire side 

[All]
So far away now 
But any day now 
I'll sail 
On the morning tide 

[Chorus - All]
Home 
Oh take me home 
Oh to the people 
I left behind 
Oh to the love 
I know I'll find 
Oooh take me home 

[Keith]
Take me home 
Far across the sea 
[All]
Home is where I long to be 

[Chorus - All x2]
Home 
(Da da da da) 
Oh take me home 
(Da da da da) 
Oh to the people 
(Da da da da da) 
I left behind 
(Da da da) 
Oh to the love 
(Da da da da) 
I know I'll find 
(Da da da da) 
Oooh take me home
