They come from the farms and the factories too 
And they all soon forget who they are. 
The cares of today are soon washed away 
As they sit at a stool by the bar. 
The girl with green eyes in the Rolling Stones shirt 
Doesn't look like she works on the land. 
The man at the end, he's a very good friend 
Of a man who sells cars second hand. 

Down at the Red Rose Café in the Harbour 
There by the port just outside Amsterdam. 
Everyone shares in the songs and the laughter. 
Everyone there is so happy to be there. 

The salesmen relax with a few pints of beer 
As they try not to speak about trade. 
The poet won't write any verses tonight. 
He may sing a sweet serenade. 
So pull up a chair and forget about life. 
It's a good thing to do now and then 
And if you like it here I have an idea 
Tomorrow let's all meet again.
