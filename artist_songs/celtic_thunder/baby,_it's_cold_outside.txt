I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside

This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful words you're humming
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar

So really I'd better scurry
Sweetheart, what's you're hurry?
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hairs looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no sir
Mind if I move a little closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
Baby it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby it's cold out there

The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Girl, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Like waves upon a tropical shore

My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, baby, you're so delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home
Oh baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there

You've really been grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
Why don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died

I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside

Come on, stay a little longer
Okay

I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
