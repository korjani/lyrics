Gonna take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

Im gonna take a little time
I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
Cos I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I know you can show me
I want to feel what love is
And I know you can show me

Wanna feel what love is
