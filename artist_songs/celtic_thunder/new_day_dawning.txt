Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above

Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above
All over this land that we love

This is our land; this is where we belong
Here between mountain and sea
Here is our future and here is our past
And here, we are destined to be

This is our land; this is where we belong
These are our fields and our farms
God gave us protection and gave us the right
And gave us the strength in our arms

Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above
All over this land that we love

This is our land; this is where we will stay
And fight for the right to be here
This is the land where our fathers have spilled
Their blood and their sweat and their tears

This is our land; this is where we belong
And where we intend to remain
We'll drive the invader back over the sea
Again and again and again and again and again and again

Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above
All over this land that we love

Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above

Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
Over our mountains and valleys of green
Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning
And shining Your light from above
All over this land that we love
All over this land that we love
