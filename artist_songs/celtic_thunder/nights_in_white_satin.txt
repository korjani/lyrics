Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send

Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

Cause' I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going thru
They can't understand

Some try to tell me
Thoughts they can't defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end

And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
How I love you
And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
How I love you
