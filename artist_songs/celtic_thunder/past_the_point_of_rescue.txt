Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now; 
Lord, I remember how
Couldn’t get enough of kissing; 
do you know how much you’re missing
No, you don’t, but I do

The days like a slow train trickle by
And even the words that I write refuse to fly
All I can hear is your song haunting me
Can’t get the melody out of my head, you see
Distractions are amusing; do you know how much you’re losing
No, you don’t, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I’m past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you; 
do you know how much I love you
No, you don’t, but I do

I never meant to push or shove you; 
do you know how much I love you
No, you don’t, but I do

I swore I’d never fall like this again
Fools like me never win; 
I came to my knees again
I can’t close the door on likelihood
Things might be just as good; 
always knew they would
Gotta let your love invite me; 
girl, do you think it might be just as good
No, you don’t, but I do

Oh, but I do, and I wonder if I’m past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you; 
do you know how much I love you
No, you don’t, but I do

I do
I do
I do
