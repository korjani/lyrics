The Angel Gabriel from heaven came
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame
All hail, said he, thou Holy Maiden Mary
Most highly favored lady
Gloria

For know a blessed mother thou shalt be
All generations laud and honor thee
Thy son shall be Emmanuel by seers foretold
Most highly favored lady
Gloria

Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head
To me, be as it pleaseth God, she said
My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name
Most highly favored lady
Gloria

Of her Emmanuel, the Christ was born
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn
And all ye men throughout the world will ever say
Most highly favored lady
Gloria
