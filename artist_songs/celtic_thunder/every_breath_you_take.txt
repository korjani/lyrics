Every breath you take 
Every move you make 
Every bond you break 
Every step you take 
I'll be watching you 

Every single day 
Every word you say 
Every game you play 
Every night you stay 
I'll be watching you 

Oh, can't you see 
You belong to me 
And my poor heart aches 
Every step you take 

Every move you make 
Every vibe you break 
Every smile you fake 
Every claim you stake 
I'll be watching you 

Since you've gone 
I've been lost 
Without a trace 
Dream at night 

I can only see your face 
Look around,but 
It's you I can't replace 

Feel so cold 
But, I long 
For your embrace 
Keep crying, baby, baby 

Oh can't you see 
You belong to me 
And my poor heart aches 
Every breath you take 

Every move you make 
Every vibe you break 
Every smile you fake 
Every claim you stake 
I'll be watching you 

I'll be watching you 
(Tonight) 
I'll be watching you 
(Tonight) 
I'll be watching you 
(Tonight) 
I'll be watching you 
(Tonight) 
I'll be watching you 
(Tonight) 
I'll be watching you
