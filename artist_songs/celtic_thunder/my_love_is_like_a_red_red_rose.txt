Oh, my love is like a red, red rose 
That's newly sprung in June 
Oh, my love is like a melody 
That's sweetly played in tune 
As fair art thou, my bonnie lass, 
So deep in love am I 
And I will love thee still, my dear, 
Till all the seas gang dry. 
Till all the seas gang dry, my dear, 
Till all the seas gang dry 
And I will love thee still, my dear, 
Till all the seas gang dry. 

'Til all the seas gang dry my, my dear 
And the rocks melt with the sun 
And I will love thee still, my dear 
While the sands of life shall run 
But faretheewell, my only love 
Oh, faretheewell a while 
And I will come again, my love 
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile 
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile, my love 
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile 
And I will come again, my love 
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile.
