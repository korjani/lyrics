Ireland, Ireland

Side by side, we stand like brothers
One for all and all together
We will stay united through darker days
And we'll be unbeatable forever

Ireland, Ireland,
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll answer Ireland's call

Come the day and come the hour
Some will live in song and story
We were born to follow our guiding star
And to meet our destiny with glory

Ireland, Ireland,
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll answer Ireland's call

Hearts of steel and heads unbowing
Vowing never to be broken
We will fight until we can fight no more
Till our final requiem is spoken

Ireland, Ireland,
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll answer Ireland's call

Ireland, Ireland,
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll answer Ireland's call
We'll answer Ireland's call
