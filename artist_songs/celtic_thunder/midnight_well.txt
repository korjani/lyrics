In the town, the people stay away
From the midnight well
For it's dark and evil, so they say
The midnight well

They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid
The fairest that they'd ever known
What a beauty, they say
But she went her own way
On that night, she set out on her own

For they say, she had a rendez-vous
At the midnight well
With a gypsy man she barely knew
At the midnight well

Nobody knew where he came from
But they remember the fire in his eyes
His earring of gold
And his hair black as coal
And a look that could just hypnotize

When he said
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Never more, they never saw her face
At the midnight well
She was gone, and never left a trace
At the midnight well

They say when the summer nights come to an end
The harvest moon glows in the sky
A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear
As the ghost of a gypsy flies by

And he says
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
