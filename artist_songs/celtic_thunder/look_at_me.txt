[Damian:]
Look at me
I'm cool and I'm charming
Debonair and disarming
That's me to a T
Take a look at me
Don't need no fandangos
I got all of the angles
Just look at me

[Damian:]
Look at me
[Keith:]
Look at you
[Damian: ]
I ain't no beginner
a natural winner
That's me to a T

[Damian:]
Take a look at me
[Keith:]
Take a look at you
[Damian:]
I can sing acappella
I'm a hell of a fella
Just look at me

[Keith:]
You know nothin' at all about ladies
Let me give you a piece of advice
You're headin' for nothin' but trouble
You'll be paying a hell of a price

'Cos you think you're a bit of a killer
That the ladies will fall at your feet "Ha"
They could eat you for supper
And spit you right out on the street

[Damian:]
Look at me
[Keith:]
Look at you
[Damian: ]
Your resistance will crumble
Get ready to rumble 1, 2, 3!
[Damian:]
Take a look at me
[Keith:]
Look at you
[Damian:]
I'm as fit as a fiddle
So let's hide it a little
Just you and me

[Keith:]
It's a very bad time to be cocky
When your out there on the pull
Hold your horse like a jockey
And don't rush in like a bull

You have to be patient with ladies
And tell them what they want to here
Keep a steady aim on your target
Don't shoot like a young pistoler

[Keith:]
Take a good look at yourself
For goodness sake
All the ladies are laughin'
Ask yourself why

Take a good look at yourself
And you will see
A natural loser
Take it from me

[Damian:]
Look at me
I ain't no beginner
A natural winner
That's me to a T

Take a look at me
I can sing acappella
I'm a hell of a fella
Just look at me

[Damian & Keith repeat what they just sang at the same time]

[Keith:]
A natural loser
Take it from me
[Damian:]
I'm a hell of a fella
Look at me
