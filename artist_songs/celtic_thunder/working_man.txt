It's a working man I am 
And I've been down underground 
And I swear to God 
If I ever see the sun 

Oh for any length of time 
I can hold it in my mind 
I never again 
Will go down underground 

At the age of sixteen years 
Oh he quarrels with his peers 
He vowed they'd never 
See another one 

In the dark recess of the mine 
Where you age before your time 
And the coal dust lies heavy 
On your lungs 

It's a working man I am 
And I've been down underground 
And I swear to God 
If I ever see the sun 

Oh for any length of time 
I can hold it in my mind 
I never again 
Will go down underground 

At the age of sixty four 
He will greet you at the door 
And he will gently lead you 
By the arm 

Through the dark recess of the mine 
He will take you back in time 
And he'll tell you of 
The hardships that were had 

It's a working man I am 
And I've been down underground 
And I swear to God 
If I ever see the sun 

Oh for any length of time 
I can hold it in my mind 
I never again will go down underground 

I never again will go down underground
