When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me; make me sway
like a lazy ocean hogs the shore
Hold me close; sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me; sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me; sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes with see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth; sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes with see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me; sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me; sway with me

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me; make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close; sway me more

Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close; sway me more

Hold me close; sway me more
Sway me now
