Look out! There's danger all about,
Can't you feel it in the air,
Look out! There's danger all about,
You had better beware.
Ooh, ooh. Under darkening skies,
Ohh, ooh. There's a full moon on the rise.

Look out! There's a Highwayman about,
No traveler is safe on the road.
Look out! And never be in doubt,
This night is about to explode.
Ooh, ooh. From the shadows he's suddenly there, 
Ooh, ooh. Then you will hear him declare.

Stand and Deliver!
I'll take your money or your life.
Stand and Deliver!
And tonight, I just might
Take your wife!
Hahahaha!

Look out! A coach has been surprised
Crossing Branagan's Moor.
No doubt, the gold that's been excised
Will be given to the poor!
Ooh, ooh. For the poor are being squeezed everyday,
My fine friend's, give it up, now it's your turn to pay.

Stand and Deliver!
I'll take your money or your life.
Stand and Deliver!
And tonight, I just might
Take your wife!
Hahahaha!

Look out! The gentry and the rich,
For I have taken an oath.
Look out! No matter which is which,
I will steal from you both!
Ooh, ooh. Who will stand up for the weak.
Ooh,ooh. Yes, mine is the voice that will speak.

Stand and Deliver!
I'll take your money or your life.
Stand and Deliver!
And tonight, I just might
Take your wife!

Stand and Deliver!
I'll take your money or your life.
Stand and Deliver!

Stand and Deliver!
I'll take your money or your life.
Stand and Deliver!
And tonight, I just might
Take your wife!
