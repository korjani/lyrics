Shadows, shadows dancing
Shadows, shadows dancing
again and again, and again and again

Shadows dancing in the moonlight 
Shadows dancing in the dark
Memories, dancing for me…..

Shadows, shadows dancing
Shadows, shadows dancing
again and again, and again and again

Come to me, come to me, feel my passion
Come fulfill my fantasy,
Come and be my phantom lover,
Be my man of mystery.
Never ever thought how much I'd want you
Never ever thought I'd be ready to scream
Will I ever feel your body near me?
Only in a never-ending dream,
In a never-ending…….

Shadows dancing in the moonlight 
Shadows dancing in the dark
Memories, dancing for me…..

Shadows
