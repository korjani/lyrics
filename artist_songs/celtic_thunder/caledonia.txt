don't know if you can see, the changes that have come over me
In these last few days, I've been afraid, that I might drift away
I've been tellin' old stories, singing songs
That made me think, about where I've come from
And that's the reason why I seem so far away today.

Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.

I have moved, and I've kept on movin'
Proved the points that I needed provin'
I Lost the friends that I needed losin'
Found others on the way
I've kissed the girls and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I've traveled hard sometimes with conscience flyin'
Somewhere in the wind

Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.
