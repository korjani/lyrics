I'm on the outside lookin' in,
But I like it this way.
Here on the outside lookin' in,
I see the games that they play.

I'm on the outside lookin' in,
But I don't really care.
Here in the outside lookin' in,
'Long as I get my share.
You know that I'll take my share…

When it's late at night,
They blow out the light,
And although they might be sleein'.
If they hear a sound,
I may be around,
And they know I could be creepin', (creepin' creepin')

They must be aware,
If they think I'm there, it's a very scary feelin'!
Lyin' in their beds,
Running through their heads,
Is one thought-what is he stealin'?

I'm on the outside lookin' in,
But I like it this way.
Here on the outside lookin' in,
I see the games that they play.
I'm on the outside lookin' in,
But I don't really care.
Here in the outside lookin' in,
'Long as I get my share.
You know that I'll take my share…

I can hear then tell
I'm a hound of hell,
As they get the smell of danger.
As I'm coming near 
I can taste their fear
Of the dark and deadly stranger.

They know who I am
I don't give a damn,
I could lead ev'ry lamb to the slaughter.
So be on your guard
For my calling card,
And be sure, to lock up your daughters.

They keep us outside lookin' in,
My sister and me.
And if we're outside lookin' in,
That's the way it will be.

We're on the outside lookin' in,
But we don't really care.
Here on the outside lookin' in,
'Long as we get our share,
You know that we'll take our share.

We're on the outside lookin' in,
We're on the outside lookin' in,
We're on the outside lookin' in.
