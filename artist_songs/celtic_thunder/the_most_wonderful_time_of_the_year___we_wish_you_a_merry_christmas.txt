It’s the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle-belling
And everyone telling you, “Be of good cheer”
It’s the most wonderful time of the year

It’s the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It’s the hap-happiest season of all

There’ll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There’ll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It’s the most wonderful time of the year
There’ll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It’s the most wonderful time of the year

There’ll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There’ll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago
Long ago

It’s the most wonderful time of the year
There’ll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It’s the most wonderful time,
It’s the most wonderful time,
It’s the most wonderful time of the year

We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,

Good tidings we bring
To you and your King
Good tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year.

Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
And a cup of good cheer.

Good tidings we bring
To you and your King
Good tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year.

We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
And a happy New Year.
