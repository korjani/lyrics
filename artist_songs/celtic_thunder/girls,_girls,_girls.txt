Well, yellow, red, black or white
Add a little bit of moonlight
For this intercontinental romance
Shy girls, sexy girls
they all like that fancy world
Champagne, a gentle song, a slow dance
Who makes it fun to spend your money?
Who calls you honey most every day?

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls

Well, they made ‘em up in Hollywood
And put ‘em into the movies
Those lovely photographic splendors
In and out of magazines
Miss World and beauty queens
Falling in love with the real big spenders.
But although their world may be frantic
They’re still romantic in their own way

So hop on, the world is swinging
Don’t sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty girls, girls, girls
Step on, the world keeps swinging
Put on the dazzling charm
Get up and find those pretty girls!

Don’t rush, keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental for that certain moment
Moonlit oceans, girls full of emotions
Stepping on that slow boat to China
And next door in Japan, they know how to please a man
Calling in for tea with my geisha
They’ve got that old-fashioned feeling
When it comes to pleasing, they know their way

So hop on, the world is swinging
Don’t sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty girls, girls, girls
Step on, the world keeps swinging
Put on the dazzling charm
Get up and find those pretty girls!

Don’t rush, keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental for that certain moment when you draw back the curtain

So hop on, the world is swinging
Don’t sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty girls

Ooh, forever

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
