I am a lineman for the county. 
And I drive the main road, 
Lookin' in the sun for another overload. 

I hear you singing in the wire. 
I can hear you thru the whine. 
And the Wichita Lineman 
is still on the line. 

I know I need a small vacation. 
But it don't look like rain. 
And if it snows that stretch down south 
won't ever stand the strain. 

And I need you more than want you. 
And I want you for all time. 
And the Wichita Lineman 
is still on the line. 
And I need you more than want you. 
And I want you for all time. 
And the Wichita Lineman 
is still on the line. 
is still on the line. 
is still on the line. 
is still on the line.
