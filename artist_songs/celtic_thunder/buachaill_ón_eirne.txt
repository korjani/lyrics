Buachaill o'n Eirne me 's bhreagfainn calin deas og 
Ni iarrfainn bo spre lei ta me fhein saibhir go leor 
'S liom Corcaigh da mheid e dha thaobh a' ghleanna 's Tir Eoghain 
'S mura n-athrai me beasai 's me n' t-oidhr' ar Chontae Mhaigh Eo 

Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free 
And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea 
Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun 
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done 

Come by the hills to the land where life is a song 
And stand where the birds fill the air with their joy all day long 
Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune 
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done 

Come by the hills to the land where legends remain 
And the stories of old fill the heart and may yet come again 
Where the past has been lost and the future is still to be won 
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done
