In my time I've been a few places,
And I've many a story to tell.
Here I am still as strong
As I've been all along,
I'm not ready for heaven or hell.
There are people who do need reminding,
That I'm still the boss around here.
I still call every shot,
And I'll tell you what's what,
And what's not, do I make myself clear.

I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cos there's life in the old dog yet.

You can't put an old head on young shoulders
My advice is the best I can give
Let them make their mistakes;
Let them fight for their rights;
Let them learn how to love and to live.

I've only got the one daughter,
Time she married a man of her own,
And the one I have planned
Has got plenty of land,
She'll be grand, and I'll stand all alone.

I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cos there's life in the old dog yet.

I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cos there's life in the old dog yet.

'Cos there's life in this old dog yet.
