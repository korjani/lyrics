I cried my last tear yesterday.
Thinking bout the last words you said to me,
I used to think that my life would end
The day you left was like losing my bestfriend.
But it gets easier everyday.
Don't understand why you went away.
I had to have something to compare
To recognize when I found something real.

No more...Tears running down my face.
No more...Holding on to memories.
No more...Staying stuck in yesterday
I had to take care of Ailee.

I'm okay. I don't need you to define me.
I'm not the girl that I used to be.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.
I'm okay, nothing that you did can break me.
I can be strong still on my own two feet.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.

I cried my last tear yesterday,
Just like the rain washing pain away.
My mind is clear now that you ain't here.
Just like a diamond, I shine from all the pressure you applied.
Your words cant keep me down.
I rised up off the ground, feeling so brand new,
And I owe it all to you.

No more...Tears running down my face.
No more...Holding on to memories.
No more...Staying stuck in yesterday.
I had to take care of Ailee.

I'm okay. I don't need you to define me.
I'm not the girl that I used to be.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.
I'm okay, nothing that you did can break me.
I can be strong stand on my own two feet.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.

Free now, flying so high, shining
Help act to long all done crying.
Tears gone, move on, head up be strong.
Stand on my own; sing a new song song.
Right now lying so hard shining.
Epic, too long, all done crying.
Tears gone, move on, head up, be strong.
Stand on my own, sing a new song.

I'm okay. I don't need you to define me.
I'm not the girl that I used to be.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.
I'm okay, nothing that you did can break my.
I can be strong stand on my own two feet.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.

Look what you did to me, look what you did.

I'm okay, nothing that you did can break my.
I can be strong stand on my own two feet.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.
I'm okay, nothing that you did can break my.
I can be strong still on my own two feet.
Look what you did to me, look what you did.
