[English Translation:]

I have a habit which is I cannot look up to see the evening sky any day.
I hate the feeling as if the whole world is gonna leave me.

That sun falling faraway will come here tomorrow.
It seems that it would not the sunshine that brightened me.

Love comes again though you leave me.
Even if I had a clamorous parting.
You weigh on my mind over and over like this.

I laugh for loving something occasionally.
I feel the happiness more occasionally.
But you are deep in me.

Whenever I give someone my heart I have a habit of saving the half.
I hate the foreboding that if I give all of it he would just leave me.

I cannot give this half to anyone
But I don’t want me broken half way to show up

Love comes again to me though you leave me.
Even if I had a clamorous parting.
You weigh on my mind over and over like this.

I laugh for loving something occasionally.
I feel the happiness more occasionally.
But you are deep in me.

Whereabouts is your mind?
I wonder if it has hovered around me.
Just like me, once in a while.
I realized that time could not wipe everything out.
I ain’t still able to call your name comfortably.

Somebody not you hugs me.
And somebody not me hugs you.
Although days flow eternally like this.

The words that I didn’t say yet to you remain in my mouth.
The love that I didn’t give the whole remain in my mind.
Maybe you are still in me...
