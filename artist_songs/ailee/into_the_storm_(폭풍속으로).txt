[English Translation:]

[Rap:]
Into the storm, hey (into the storm)
I call your name in my dream at times.
If you get to fly free from the raging storm it’s a miracle (it’s a miracle)

This will pass soon. It’s almost the end.
You need to stand it a bit longer.
It will wish away our happy memory and reminiscence.

Love is a storm which rages more heavily and take all of ours away more painfully.
In walking in the dark
I will fall in love with someone.
Again~

[Rap:]
After this wind vanishes
How many nights should I stay up hurting until my mind closed tightly for a painful wound opens?

Is my day and day filled with tears?
After suffering this terrible fever
How much can I become free out of all conscience?
Where will be the place which my mind will reach?

This is enough. It’s over.
Why don’t this vicious love be removed even if I leave out, cry, and mow?

Love is a storm which rages more heavily and take all of ours away more painfully.
In walking in the dark
I will fall in love with someone.
Again~

Love is over~ (love is over)
Love is over~ (it’s God’s will)
Love is over~ (you and I now)
Love is over~ (love is over)
Love is over~ (we are history)

I may look for you.
Though I leave you remaining little memory
I have you~

I cannot forget you, however my efforts~
Love is a storm which rages more heavily and take all of ours away more painfully.
In walking in the dark
I will fall in love with someone.
Again~

Love is over~ (love is over)
Love is over~ (it’s God’s will)
Love is over~ (you and I now)
Love is over~ (love is over)
Love is over~ (we are history)

I may look for you, again.
