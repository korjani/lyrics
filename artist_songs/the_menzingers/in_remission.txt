I've got a winning lotto ticket from the state of Massachusetts,
Tucked in the back of my wallet,
I'll cash it when I'm back in Boston,
With a blank eye from the cashier,
for why it's torn and busted... up.

I remember that moment of silence,
I was at a mall in Norwich,
Shoppers stared at the ground,
The escalators went on smoke breaks,
Oh 1918, you've yet to see the worst of humans acting.

Maybe the future's just a little bit weird,
Maybe the God you love is all I've got to fear.
Life's a terminal illness in remission,
So I took the weight of it all out for a drink,
And then we drove back drunk through the busy city streets.

I hate how I always get nervous every time I try to speak,
In front of a big crowd, a pretty girl, or the police.
And I hate the things that I know about you,
And all the horrible things that you do.
I don't want to be late for war today,
I want to chew up my dinner and spit in your face,
Light fire to your home and tap your cell phone.

Oh yeah!

If everyone needs a crutch, then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.
If everyone needs a crutch, then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.
If everyone needs a crutch, then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.
If everyone needs a crutch, then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.

Oh yeah!

If everyone needs a crutch then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.
If everyone needs a crutch then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you.
