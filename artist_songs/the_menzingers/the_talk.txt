Alright, I'm okay
We did it your way
I never loved you anyway
You've got your problems
That's your problem
I never loved you anyway

Alright, I'm okay
We did it your way
I never loved you anyway
You've got your problems
That's your problem
I never loved you anyway

Your lips are poison
Your heart is frozen
You never loved me anyway

I want my life back
You turned my chest black
I don't owe you anything

Got me strung out
I'm sweating bullets
I can't sleep
I'm crawling out of my skin
But I'll be okay
I did it my way
And I don't owe you anything

You've got no heart of gold

You're aesthetic
You're pathetic
I'll never owe you anything
Hey pariah; you're the liar
And I don't owe you anything

I'm not like you

You've got no heart of gold

I'm not like you

You've got no heart of gold

We'll chalk it up to progress
