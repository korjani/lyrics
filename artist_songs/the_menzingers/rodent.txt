I wanna be more discreet, I want em all to quit following me
In the walls held captive, lives a mouse
I don't have the guts to kick him out
In the bars where I live, lives someone
Who I woulda hated when I was young

When I swore life had a purpose
When I was sure the whole things worth it
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me

Me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all

So burn the fucker down, I don't care anymore
I'll let it all go
Cause if this is what you want, I understand
Good luck with the guilt left on your hands

I've tried running, I've tried hiding
I've tried everything but dying
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me
Yeah me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all

I have only bad news
I have only bad news
I have only bad news
News for you

I have only bad news
I have only bad news
I have only bad news
News for you
