Once she came like a vision in the night,
I fell in love before the morning arrived,
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat,
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street,
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar,
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer,
There in the moment we kissed in a hammock,
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better,
Well, I thought 'No Control' or 'Suffer'.

And then she became queen of the neighbourhood parties,
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride,
Kept the guitar right by my side,
Was better than conversing with the kids I didn't like,
But on the fourth of July, the fireworks rang out,
She met a new boy, who was more hip and less strung out,
I drove home with fire in the sky,
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something,
That you were always humming.

As time tables suggest,
We were only just friends,
In constant motions covering stilts,
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home,
Or something to mix with your Coke.

Well maybe if you want to wander 'round outside tonight,
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight,
Or really whenever, I only want to talk,
I only want to relive what was lost.

As time tables suggest,
We were only just friends,
In constant motions covering stilts,
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home,
Or something to mix with...
