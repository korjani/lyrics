I never loved you but I tried to,
and you were so ambiguous, 
We blamed the faulty wires,
When we found our blood was pumped from stone.

My memory is fading faster,
I never bought a warranty,
When I called and said I was leaving,
You were one step ahead of me.

Cold blankets, cold shoulders,
Missed calls and apologies,
But I met the other you, I met the other you,
Cold blankets, cold shoulders,
They’ve been there since I met you,
At Tasker-Morris Station.

So come back down to the middle where I’ve been,
Settling into, with or without you.
Come back down to the middle where I’ve been,
Settling into, with or without you.

But what do I know,
But what do I know,
But what do I know,
Except our blood is pumped from stone.
