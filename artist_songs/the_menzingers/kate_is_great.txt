I used to have a home with a room and a bed,
A porch and a driveway with a big garage
But I traded it in I kept some faith
And laid my head down every night
And it seems so far away, it seems so far away

Remember me now cause things always change 
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now cause things always change 
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same

I learned somethings about the places I saw 
I learned something about myself
I guess it came the hard way now I know what counts
I've got one prayer it's in your confidence 

I know all the places I don't want to be
Everyone's gone there's no one just me 

Remember me now cause things always change 
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now cause things always change 
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same

Remember me next time I go away
For the first time in my life I wanna stay
I can count on one hand here today 
The only things that matter to me anyway
And it seems so far away, seems so far away

Remember me now cause things always change 
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now cause things always change 
5 long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
