We were young kids.
We made a difference.
We survived those churches and hospitals.
Tall tales get taller, but they'll never grow old.
Yours is a flame, it never goes out:
A guiding light in the storm for our sinking hearts.
Yours is the summer that will never end.

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man.
Sleep now, it's only getting better.

Some day we'll all die; some people never knew
You lived the lives of a thousand men.
Living from your feet, never from your knees.
You are the light above, you are the air in our lungs.
You are the earth beneath our feet.

No don't fade away, don't fade away.
No don't take him away, don't take him away.

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man.
Sleep now, it's only getting better.

(No don't take him away, don't take him away)
