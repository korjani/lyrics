My girl she's a good one,
she's always on my mind,
she is a rose and I am a stone,
she's always poking her head out
and striking a pose,
I'm always plucking her petals,
and some nights we fall out of love,
some nights I sleep in her arms,
some nights I sleep on the couch.

Well I spent that night in our past life,
wringing out the years from our shoes,
in the distance yo lived with my signature
penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest,
but I was a pushy little one,
when you tried to find someone new,
I just kind of waited around for you,
because what else was I suppose to do?

I know where your heartache exists,
it's when you are alone and when you're around me.

I saw it in your face the day we parked your car
on the shoulder by the reservoir,
and in my mouth my words did hide
for fear of being recognized.

I know where your heartache exists
Its when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
Its when you are alone and when you're around me

I know where your heartache exists
