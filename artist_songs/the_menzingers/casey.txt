Well I sat and thought about you
On the long ride back to Philly
From the way that you'd wear your hair
To the way that you'd laugh when you drank too much
Before the plug was pulled, the fires burned out
And all the parties grew bored
You waited tables
I waited for your shift breaks

And Gin and Casey
Used to dance inside of me
And I bet I sound like a broken record
Every time I open my mouth
I want to wander around the city with you again
Like when you waited tables
And I waited for your shift breaks

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Every evening
Me and Casey used to get high and listen to our boredom
Cause it was so much easier
Cause it was so much easier than dealing with everything

So Casey, Casey, Casey
Just tell me when you're ready
I'm all packed to go
On a search for that old place we found forever ago
When we could take my car
Yes, she's still got the spirit
We could live, 
We could live, 
We could live, 
and no longer just have to hear it

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Every evening
Me and Casey used to get high and listen to our boredom
Cause it was so much easier
Cause it was so much easier than dealing with everything
Cause it was so much easier than dealing with everything
Cause it was so much easier than dealing with everything
