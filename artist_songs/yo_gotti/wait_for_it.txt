All my bitches feisty, All my niggas shiesty's
All I do is shoot dices, I might take a nigga life's
I remember I was broke as fuck sleeping on the floor with the mice's
Gotta go and see these preacher cause I ain't living righteous
Know these niggas wanna crate me, cause they really don't like me
I ain't 2PAC but I'm on death row, I ain't Suge Knight but I'm real cut throat
Everybody lay down on the dam floor, and you better not move or you going get hurt
I'll see your grand mama at the front door, BET awards rich nigga front row!
