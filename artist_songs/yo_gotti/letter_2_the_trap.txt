I know time flies by (flies by)
I ain't shit in your eyes (I ain't shit)
I been fuckin' with this rap game, I been out in Dubai (I been out)
I got a love and hate relationship with you at the same time
I wanna be there with you but then I wanna be there with you
At the same time
I'm infatuated with you, that shit give me a rush (I am)
All that dirty money, all that re-in' up
Back and forth in the kitchen cookin' up
It's a different feelin'
I coulda went to culinary arts, 'cause cheffin' an art (art, it's a aart)
Once upon a time I counted seven-hundred fifty thousand in the dark (woo)

You should be proud of me
You should be happy I'm gone
You should encourage me more
You should be tellin' me praise the Lord
You know this shit too hard to ignore
You should've never showed me a million cash
What you do that for? (Why?)
Why you take me to Mexico in the first place? (First place?)
Now I'm goin' back and forth (damn)
Cut out the middle man, go see the plug
We call it the backdoor
I wanted to be a rapper in the first place
What you give me a sack for? (Why?)
I had anger management in the first place (brrrr)
What you give me a MAC for? (Why?)
Taught me how to whip it, how to held out
So I can go tax for it

I'm yours truly, Yo Gotti, and I appreciate you (this my letter to you)
I'd never take that stand and humiliate you (this my letter to you)
Broke and starvin', you put food on my table (I'm gone)
You were there when I wasn't able, you helped me build my label (face, this my letter to you)
You wouldn't let me be a pussy, you put heart in me
I appreciate you trap, forever part of me (I do)
They say you fucked my life up, yeah, arguably
I don't agree with that but you did take my dogs from me
Damn, RIP Cecil (damn)
Damn, RIP BG
You did take my dogs from me
I'll never forgive you for that (this my letter to the trap)
