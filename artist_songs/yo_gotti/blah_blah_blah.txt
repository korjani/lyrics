Blah blah blah blah blah

Put my bitch up out the house 'cause all she do is argue
Put that bitch up out the whip 'cause all she do is argue
All I heard is "Blah blah blah blah blah", bitch, who are you?
Made my side bitch my main bitch 'cause she don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue

Put my bitch up out the house, told her leave
You no longer welcome here (no, no), give me my keys
All you do is nag (blah, blah), all you do is brag (blah, blah)
All you do is come play, play that shit, so sad
All that back and forth, being extra, cover scenes
I won't marry you so you won't never get no ring
All I hear is "blah, blah, blah, blah", give me my keys to my car, car, car, car
And can go far, far, far, far, far
Here we are, after all, losin' focus, adderall
Fuss and fight, he said, she said, head hurt, Tylenol
Can't believe this hoe went through my phone and text my other broad
When she ask me 'bout the bitch, I just responded "Blah, blah, blah"

Put my bitch up out the house 'cause all she do is argue
Put that bitch up out the whip 'cause all she do is argue
All I heard is "Blah blah blah blah blah", bitch, who are you?
Made my side bitch my main bitch 'cause she don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue

My hoes won't ask me 'bout another hoe
I'm not arguin' with no bitch, I don't even know that hoe
Try to go to sleep at night, you hit my ear and shit
Bitch I had a bad day, tryna hear that shit
Oh my plug just got just called up with my workin' shit
You like "Blah blah blah blah blah" all that perky shit
Besides, I'm tired of hearin' you hatin' on my lil perky bitch
And you way too excited 'bout this purse and shit
Head cool, pussy good but it ain't worth the shit
And ain't nothin' more annoyin' than a worse bitch
I want my purses back, my shoes when you leave
Bitches say I'm petty, hoe I even want the weave, I pay for it
Hoes they call my phone like 100 sometime
Hoe went through my phone, she had to lose her fuckin' mind
Hoe must think she run some, thought she the motherfuckin' man
All this back and forth, ain't got no motherfuckin' time

Put my bitch up out the house 'cause all she do is argue
Put that bitch up out the whip 'cause all she do is argue
All I heard is "Blah blah blah blah blah", bitch, who are you?
Made my side bitch my main bitch 'cause she don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue
Blah, blah, blah, blah, she don't argue
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I don't argue
