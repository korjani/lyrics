[Yo Gotti:]
Talkin' 'bout a nigga, ye ain't never gon' win
Told a bitch I like her and her girlfriend
Told that bitch I want her and her twin sister
Then I fucked her with my chains on and my pistol
I'm a dope boy, I be ballin'
I got dope money in my Balmains
Take a nigga bitch, I feel like Scarface
Damn her ass too big, I think they all fake
Never knew I't gon' be like that
Truck got the big B on that
Chain got the CMG on that
Price high, we can't eat like that
Niggas hatin', you can't eat like that
We ain't liked you, we never did
Can't knock her 'fore I get no bread
Shawty thick, I just want that head

Hair weave killer, call me 2 Chainz
Lying on your dick, boy you too lame

Came through in that Lamb', mood changed
