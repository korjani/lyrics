[Yo Gotti:]
Swerve on 'em, purge on 'em
Hit 'em with the wrong number, put the curve on 'em
Single but you say you got a old man
Why your homie act like he your old man
Lot of these niggas in the friend zone
Touchdown I be in the end zone
I got legs in the field goal
Sippin' on Rolls Roll and Rose Gold
Shawty bad and her friends bad
He got fake watches, she got real bands
Let a young rich nigga in your life
Dope boy, I eat that pussy right
You know I got you

[French Montana:]
Game time, bring it all out
Either shawty fall in or she fall out
Do the money dance, 100 racks of gwuap
Rollin' Hollywood joints back to the block
Touchdown nigga, touchdown nigga
That's a buck in the quarter, bust down nigga
We the kings of the underground nigga
Give us the brown bag, keep the crown nigga
Fuck with me girl you know I got it
Bands in the backyard, man [?]
Keep it 1000, we ain't nothin' like it
If you a bad bitch then do it every night
