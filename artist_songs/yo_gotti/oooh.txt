[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti:]
Everyday you see me boy I'm fresh as hell
Brand new purple J's don't work itselfs
Don't wear cologne I smell like cream
I'm from the US but my swag are from overseas
I'm killin' bitches on my instagram
She like my pics and she dressy who I am
I like her pics I like her too
They say she a model bitch I wouldn't never knew
I be fucking bad hoes
I'm turnt up for it sway goes
At the top it's just us nigga
I'm paranoid I don't really trust niggas

[Hook - Rich Homie Quan:]
I've you hate me if see you straight I won't tell nobody
And I got a couple secrets that I can't tell nobody
Besides my mama fuck these bitches cause I don't love nobody
On my hip where I keep it cause I don't trust nobody
Thou shall fear no evil, and never trust nobody
But I will ride for your people you can never trust nobody
Watch out for them niggas who keep a close eye on them bitches
I don't know why I'm feeling like this, but I can't trust nobody
I can't trust nobody
I can't trust nobody

[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti:]
Trust is hard to get nigga
Squad mob with my hitters
Ridin around with all my niggas
Y'all already know I ain't no killer
I rock versace with the mancielas
Half a mill in little pillows
Damn show it feel good
Be gettin' money with my niggas
Who ever ride with the team
They ain't without the beam
Keep a [?] 'fore they hit the streets
Hundred bands in my jeans
Never talk what I've seen
Bitches don't mean shit to me
These niggas don't mean shit to me
All this money might get to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snootie Wild:]
Trust nothing but God, oh lord
Who faked in my squad, oh lord
Hit it by the cross from my mob, oh lord
I'm gone catch a body, bitch
I'm gone catch a body
Porsche push retarded
Hit the club it's sparkin'
CMG the takeover CMG the party
Goons all on the dancefloor don't become a target
Chickens in the minivan show you where I parked it

[Hook]
