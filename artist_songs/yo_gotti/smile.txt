[Chorus:]
Put a smile on your face hater
Put a smile on your face hater
What you mad at me for dab to the paper
Put a smile on your face bitch
Put a smile on your face bitch
What you hating on your friend for
What you mad at the world for
I can put a smile on his face
I can put a smile on his face (put a smile on his face)
I can put a smile on his face
I can put a smile on his face (put a smile on his face)
I can put a smile on his face
I can put a smile on his face (put a smile on his face)
I can put a smile on his face
I can put a smile on his face (put a smile on his face)

[Verse 1:]
Say your girl gave me face jeans put a smile on her face (put a smile on her face)
I been popping pills all day the one with the smile on the face
When you get a check like this that'll put a smile on your face
When you got a wrist like this that'll put a frown on they face
When you ball hard like me they gon call a foul on the play
Shit that they smoking too quiet so I got the loud on the way
Shit that I'm rocking in the club boy I spent a bag on a [?]
Shit that I'm drinking in the club that was 10 thousand a case
If you see a hater with a frown on em turn it upside down on em
Hashtag pound put the pound on em
He a pussy it's going down on em
100 round drum in the case I'll put a child in his place
Walk around with 100k and won't give your bitch the time of the day

[Chorus:]
Put a smile on your face hater
Put a smile on your face hater
What you mad at me for dab to the paper
Put a smile on your face bitch
Put a smile on your face bitch
What you hating on your friend for
What you mad at the world for
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)

[Verse 2:]
Hi hater
Popping bottles standing on tables
Sparkles in the air celebration
We just tryna dab to the paper
Style on my bitches, smile on my peers, smile on my face walking in the crib
Frowns on my haters when they see the crib you should see they face when they see the whip
I can put a smile on your face that's all jokes to the side
And nigga put a frown on your face some shit you just can't hide
Let me put my hand on your waist pull your hair and hit it from behind
I bet that put a smile on your face bet that put a smile on your face
Heard you got a job that you hate heard you got some bills that's late
Heard you got a nigga you can't shake heard you got a friend that's fake
Girl you need a thug in your life girl I need a plug in my life
I never had love in my life I was busy selling drugs all my life

[Chorus:]
Put a smile on your face hater
Put a smile on your face hater
What you mad at me for dab to the paper
Put a smile on your face bitch
Put a smile on your face bitch
What you hating on your friend for
What you mad at the world for
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
I can put a smile on your face
I can put a smile on your face (put a smile on your face)
