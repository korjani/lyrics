[Intro - Yo Gotti:]
Yeah, hand on my gun, hand on my bible

Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible

[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti:]
Ima dope boy never fold never told grand on overload
In the kitchen with the stove, baking soda, pot and bowl
Swear to God I'll kill a nigga then repent
Im a millionaire and I grind for every cent (Amen)
Plug came that's a blessing
Fuck these hoes I ain't stressing (never)
Leave the house with no weapon
Ima make sure the money right no discrepancies
Grind mode
Young nigga had a quarter pound but he stayed down down front row at the SuperBowl
Team strong we campaign pop champagne win the SuperBowl

You want a sack I make it show up (show up)
Don't make me bring that Lam out just to pick your hoe up (lil nigga)

Dope boy I got money and the power (preach)

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne:]
Church, hand on my gun hand on my bible
Fingers on the trigger like vagina
The bible open right there on the dresser I just pray that all my enemies are watching me from heaven
I'm peeking round the corner before I turn that muthafucka
I played them corners like I'm Richard Sherman muthafucka
I play in my position on these niggas 1st and 10
Treating that prescription like a scripture amen
Now we in the kitchen with the chickens and the hens
Lord please forgive us but we sinning for the rent
I just popped 2 pills I feel them bitches kickin in
0-100 got a ticket in the Benz
Show me where the bible say thou shall not ball
I just hit a lick for a thousand Adderalls
I just rolled a blunt up in a page from the bible
And all my niggas psycho and all my bitches spiteful
John 3:16
