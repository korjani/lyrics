They just called a nigga out of retirement
I'm a product of my environment
All I heard was gunshots and sirens
All I heard was gunshots and sirens
Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu

Fresh up off a tour, I'm in grind mode
Walk in new Chanels, where you find those?
And I can count a million with my eyes closed
And quit postin that bitch nigga to my hoes
Niggas own they jewelry and they lease it
Niggas getting too high, they out here tweaking
And I still get head from a chubby chick
And every now and then I hit an ugly bitch

Ooouuu, Ooouuu
I just keep this shit real, uh
And I still get head from a chubby chick
And every now and then I hit an ugly bitch

Spent 250 out in Paris
That's your bitch? I hope you don't get married
Don't ask me but I know why
We just flew your bitch out to Dubai
Not just me but the squad though
On the real, your bitch be going hard though, Ooouuu
Young millionaires, that's the squad goes
And we ain't into rumors or who start those, Ooouuu
And yo Youngsta, where them choppers at?
Since everybody beefing on the internet
We gon' go shoot up the Apple store
So we don't gotta see the beef no more, Ooouuu
We just got a seven, that's a chopper
I got a number of killers on the roster
I got a number of dealers in the family
And I'm a catch a body 'fore a Grammy

Ooouuu, Ooouuu
Faker, faker, faker
I got a number of dealers in the family
And I'm a catch a body 'fore a Grammy

He be on his cycle, he a ho for real
He just out here rapping, touched no dope for real
Why would I beef with one of you locals, I got global skills
The ones that listen to me don't even know you steal
I'm from the trap but I be with Ye and Jay now
I might drop my album any day now
Feds might come and get me any day now
But I'm prepared mentally to go and lay it down, Ooouuu
I'm a hater cause I hate these rappers
Faker than a gold candy wrapper
But you be rapping, no I don't yo
I just talk for niggas in the ghetto
100, 000 in my school house
Niggas had it rough, I had a smooth draft
And every time they dropped, I broke the shoes out
I ain't doing no more joints, I brought the Loubs out

Ooouuu, Ooouuu, aye

I went platinum with no features
Whole team mean it ain't no leaches
And you ain't in the game, you in the bleachers
You cheering for a nigga, where your pom-poms?
LA Reid gave me that check and I went dumb-dumb
Went and signed a lot of gangsters where I'm from-from
Oh, I got these haters sick, where your Tum-Tums
If he ain't talking money, he ain't saying nothing

Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I am
