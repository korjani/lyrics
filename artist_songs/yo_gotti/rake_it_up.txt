I was sending bricks to Harlem back when Jay was still with Dame
I'm a Phillipe Chow, (what) I got a Patek on (okay)
Got a stripper with me she pick up the check, home (phrrr)
She gon' fuck it up, fuck it up, she don't need makeup (makeup)
She gon' rake it up, rake it up until a nigga pay up (pay up)
She said pay for the pussy, pay for the pussy (pay), wait for the pussy, wait for the pussy (wait)
Ask God to forgive me (why) 'cause I pray for the pussy, pray for the pussy

Well, I'm the dough boy, the one they talking about
All these gossiping ass niggas got my name in they mouth
I know the bad bitches but know niggas who bitches too
They should bleed once a month 'cause that's what these bitches do
You a bitch and ya bitch should expose you
All that pillow talking nigga that's what the hoes do
You a bitch, word to my nigga, Short
We won't never write no statement, we ain't showing up in court
We don't do no gossiping, we don't do no arguing
We don't beef on social sites, we just hit our target
We don't do no rumors, we don't don't pay no shooters (brrr)
You a little bitty bitch, you should work at Hooters (yo)
You a old hater, you a fucking cougar
You a bitch and he a bitch and y'all like twin sisters
Respect ya hustle, get ya money, baby, win with us
Ya boyfriend acting like a bitch then why you still with him?

I tell all my hoes - rake it up
Break it down, back it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, back it up, back it up
Rake it up, rake it up, back it up, back it up
I tell all my hoes - rake it up
Break it down, back it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, rake it up, rake it up
