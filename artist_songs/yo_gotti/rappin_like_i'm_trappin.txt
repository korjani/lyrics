I got drama on the beat and he be going crazy,
Tell it in the streets, I see them G are navy.
I hid a grip that's big, 'cause they don't want replace me,
Been it for the show, I'm selling out lately.

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping,
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen,
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping,
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping.
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen,
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping.

Today gonna be a good one, one my niggas bug one,
Younger in the hood, I want a break, so I took one.
Begging on a cook one, promise I won't shoot one,
Bitch, I've got a million, now I'm trying to get jump one.
Had to build a team, know that is a good one,
Looking for some more real niggas, but I ain't seen none.
Rap your ass off, I'm a get my hands off,
Let you play with me, I'm a blow your ears off.
Lot of nigga rear me, think I'm any grand,
Talking money, money, money, but you'll never see 'em shine.
Pearls up in your town, rolling with your damn,
Niggas say I'm hot, but bitch I think I'll clack.

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping,
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen,
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping.

These verses to it, I'm going hard, I say 'MW is still a car.
You gotta look good for it, sure she ain't got no heart.
The nigga's eggs, it's about feeling them, pussy, they feeling them.
Niggas bad, bitches on 'em, baby on like souvenir.

My studio is my track spot, bring it down, might trap hot,
Early in the street roll, my note pad is my stash bar,
I'm rapping like I'm shopping, my heels are just soppy,
My boot is in my kitchen, my engineer is shuffling.
I spit some, it's like whip, and I've got pirate's vision,
Bad bitch, know I'm a bad bitch, I'm in the town, I had shit.
My foundation established, probe niggas, I pass them,
Real talking, I see mad chips, real talk, I see mad chips.
Two hundred bands, five hundred more,
I'm like the circus, I fuck the clowns.
Baby, I'm a surf around, fuck around, marathon around the town.

Investigation tapping niggas rating 'till it fucks a sneach.
You the type that never says, shit was for your served bricks.
I'm busy like the tap fro, stacking paper every day,
This Friday like my afro, I got that bitch operate.
A nigga stay down, if it could, that's what the block would say.
In the club like highway, Patron over this club and pay.
Stacking like I'm banging, bitch they hear me saying,
The real niggas acting different when you gain the shit they're changing.
I'm in the kitchen, rapping, in the loose, snapping,
Whatever happens, happens, I'm just trapping like I'm rapping.

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping,
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen,
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping,
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping.
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen,
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping.
