I used to dream about a.9 when I had 4 in the spliff
When you fucked up, don't want no niggas around, is you and your bitch
Used to live in public housin', get free lunch at the school
Had to jump 'fore they came out, had them bring the strap to the school
I was trappin' in school, I was actin' a fool
I was a freshman and I was the freshest nigga in school, yeah yeah

Leavin' the school. I was fuckin' the seniors
I got caught with the strap and sent to juvinial detention. yeah yeah
Never liked police, shootin' dice under bleachers
Free period, get money, don't mind PE class
No books in the book bag, took math, I need to add
I was gon' get a bag
Came to school, filled the lot up
Play with me and get shot up
Five hundred for the Coogi sweater
Three-fifty for the Prada's
Teacher told me I could be anythin' I wanna be
OG told me you gotta love yourself and don't love the streets

I used to dream about a.9 when I had 4 in the spliff
When you fucked up, don't want no niggas around, is you and your bitch
Used to live in public housin', get free lunch at the school
Had to jump 'fore they came out, had them bring the strap to the school
I was trappin' in school, I was actin' a fool
I was a freshman and I was the freshest nigga in school, yeah yeah
I was trappin' in school, I was actin' a fool
I was a freshman and I was the freshest nigga in school, yeah yeah

[Blac Youngsta:]
Last nigga played with me in school, gave him the street blues
Nigga tried to jump me in school so I went and got my tools
Yeah, I was fresh in school
I been broke all my life, I got somethin' to prove hoe
I shot my teacher hoe bitch, I took recess hoe bitch
You better Google me and do your research hoe
I fucked plenty bitches under the bleachers hoe
I cheat on my bitch 'cause I don't need you hoe
When I skip school, Grandma whoop my ass
I give my lil' brother my last
Made the best out of what we had
Tried my best to make it last
It was hard on me and my brothers
I ain't never ever see my dad
All my life I had to struggle
That's why I talk shit and show my ass
