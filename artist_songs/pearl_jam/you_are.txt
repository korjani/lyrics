This broken wheel is coming undone
And the roads exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you,...

Love is a tower
And you're the key
Leading me higher
When you let me in

Keeping us close,... so close
On down the line

Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you

You are a tower of
Strength to me
The darkening hour
Sees light again

Ooh wah, ooh wah, you are...

Love is a tower
Of strength to me
I am the shoreline
But you're the sea

You are.
