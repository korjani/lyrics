It's a disease,... and they're all green
It emminates from their being
A satiation with occupation

And like weeds,.. with big leaves
Stealing light from what's beneath
Where they have more,...
Still they take more

Course I know,.. then I don't
There's a stoway with my throat
It's deceiving
I don't believe him

We can scream,.. out our doors
Behind the wall a fat man snores
In his dreams he's,...
Choking on leaves

Well I guess
There's nothing wrong with what you say
Believe me
Just asking you to sway
No white
Or black
Just grey
Can you feel this,..
World with your heart and not your brain?
