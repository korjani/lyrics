sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette 
thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic 
what's missing? he's living a day he'll soon forget 
that's one more time around, the sun is going down 
the moon is out, but he's drunk and shouting, putting people down 
he's pissing, he's living a day he'll soon forget 
counts his money every morning 
the only thing that keeps him horny
locked in a giant house, that's alarming 
the townsfolk, they all laugh 
sorry is the fool who trades his love for high-rise rent 
seems the more you make, equals the loneliness you get 
and it's fitting, he's barely living, a day he'll soon forget 
that's one more time around, there is not a sound
he's lying dead clutching benjamins, never put the money down 
he's stiffening, we're all whistling 
a man we'll soon forget
