don't feel like home, he's a little out...
and all these words elope, it's nothing like your poem
putting in, inputting in, don't feel like methadone
a scratching voice all alone, there's nothing like your baritone
it's nothing as it seems, the little that he needs, it's home
the little that he sees, is nothing he concedes, it's home
one uninvited chromosome, a blanket like the ozone
it's nothing as it seems, all that he needs, it's home
the little that he frees, is nothing he believes
saving up a sunny day, something maybe two tone
anything of his own, a chip off the cornerstone
who's kidding, rainy day
a one way ticket headstone
occupations overthrown, a whisper through a megaphone
it's nothing as it seems, the little that he needs, it's home
the little that he sees, is nothing he concedes, it's home
and all that he frees, a little bittersweet, it's home
it's nothing as it seems, the little that you see, it's home...
