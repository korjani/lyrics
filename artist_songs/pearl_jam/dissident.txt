she nursed him there, over a night
i wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
what to say...what to say
but soon she was down, soon he was low
at a quarter past...a holy no...
she had to turn around
when she couldn't hold, oh...she folded...
a dissident is here
escape is never, the safest path
a dissident, a dissident is here
and to this day, she's glided on
always home but so far away
like a word misplaced
nothing said, what a waste
when she had contact...with the conflict...
there was meaning, but she sold him to the state
she had to turn around
when she couldn't hold...she folded...
a dissident is here
escape is never, the safest path
a dissident, a dissident is here
she gave him away when she couldn't hold...no...she folded...
a dissident is here
escape is never, the safest path
a dissident, a dissident is here
couldn't hold on...she couldn't hold...no...she folded...
a dissident is here
escape is never the safest place
a dissident is here
