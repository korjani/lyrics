I wanna shake
I wanna wind out
I wanna leave
This mind and shout

I've lived
All this life
Like an ocean
In disguise
I don't live for
Ever
You can't keep
Me here

I wanna race
With the sundown
I want a last breath

Forgive
Every being
The bad feelings
It's just me
I won't wait
For answers
You can't keep
Me here

I wanna rise
And say goodnight
Wanna take
A look on the other side

I've lived
All those lives
It's been wonder
Full at night
I will live for
Ever
You can't keep
Me here
