don't it make you smile?
don't it make you smile?
when the sun don't shine? (shine at all)
don't it make you smile?
don't it make you smile?
don't it make me smile?
when the sun don't shine, it don't shine at all
don't it make me smile?
i miss you already... i miss you always
i miss you already... i miss you all day
this is how i feel...
i miss you already... i miss you always
three crooked hearts and swirls all around... i miss you all day
