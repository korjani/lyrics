they don't eat, don't sleep
they don't feed, they don't seethe
bare their gums when they moan and squeak
lick the dirt off a larger one's feet
they don't push, don't crowd
congregate until they're much too loud
fuck to procreate till they are dead
drink the blood of their so called best friend
they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
don't pack themselves together and run as one
don't shit where they're not supposed to
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare
they don't scam, don't fight
don't oppress an equals given rights
starve the poor so they can be well fed
line their holes with the dead ones bread
they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way 
don't pack themselves together and run as one 
don't shit where they're not supposed to 
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare...
they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
don't pack themselves together and run as one 
don't shit where they're not supposed to 
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare...
rats...they don't compare 
rats...they don't compare
