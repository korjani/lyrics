Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under the red dress I wish I could see
further North the warmth of lovin' lingering
Now Johnny he be having lots of women
Oh the reason he'd be smiling known to him

On the left the girl in red so innocent
never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
Yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin
can't help but wonder where and who she is
Oh and the memory's always getting clearer
First thirty years and more I've loved her so
but now I need to know why she's with him

and I sleep with the light on in case she comes
and I sleep with the light on in case she...

Recently as I was waiting on a dream
she came to visit lost and lonely me
Oh she leaned over the bed and with the lips above my head
she asked if I had seen her Johnny
Oh and I hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
oh yeah I have been hoping that when she came that she would come for me

Hey... hey...

I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
that when she came she'd be coming just for me...
I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
that when she came she'd be coming just for me...ah yeah!

Aw yeah!
Aw yeah!
Hoo...
