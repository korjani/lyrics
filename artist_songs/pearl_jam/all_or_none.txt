It's a hopeless... situation
And I'm starting to believe
That this hopeless... situation
Is what I'm trying to achieve

But I try
To run on
Towards
All or none,... all or none

Here's the selfless confession
Leading me back to war
Can we help that,.. our destinations
Are the ones we've been before

I still try
To run on
Towards all
Or none,... all or none

To myself I... surrender
To the one I'll never please

I still try,.. to run on
But I still try,.. to run on
But it's
All or none,... all or none.
