No more upset mornings
No more trying evenings
This American dream
I am disbelieving

When the gas in my tank
Feels like money in the bank
Gonna blow it all this time
Take me one last ride

For the lights of this city
They only look good when I'm speeding
Gonna leave 'em all behind me
Cause this time

I'm gone

Long gone
This time I'm letting go of it all
So long
Cause this time I'm gone

In the far off distance
As my tail-lights fade
No one thinks to witness
But they will someday

Feel like a question is forming
And the answeres far
I I'll be what I could be
Once I get of of this town

For the lights of this city
They have lost all feeling
Gonna leave 'em all behind me
Cause this time

I'm gone

Long gone
This time I'm letting go of it all
So long
Long gone, I'm letting go of it all
Cause this time I'm gone

If nothing is everything
If nothing is everything, I'll have it all

If nothing is everything
If nothing is everything, I'll have it all

I am gone
