there's a girl on a ledge, who's got nowhere to turn
because all the love that she had was just wood that she burned
now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern
she can blame the world...or pray til dawn
but only love...can breakerfall
breakerfall
yeah only love can breakerfall...fall
it's like she's lost the invitation to the party on earth
and she's standing outside hating everyone here
yeah she's her own disease, crying to her doll
but only love...can breakerfall
breakerfall
only love can breakerfall
yeah...
fall, breakerfall, love oh oh..
can breakerfall
ooh yeah only love can breakerfall...
love, love, can breakerfall, fall...
love, ooh can breakerfall...
only love can breaker..
