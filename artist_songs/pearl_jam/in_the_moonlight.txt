Take a ladder up to my room. 
Take a ladder up to the moon. 
I am a light reflected off of the moon to you. 
So faraway, running out of room. 
Running out of time, 
Meet me on the moon... on the moon. 
We'll have it all to ourselves. 
We'll keep it, and no one could tell. 
All our searching... 
Sharing a kiss on the moon. [x2] 
The german sky... don't ask me why. 
It's ten o'clock and my only thought is of you and the moon. [x2] 
And the moon. [x2] 
It's ten... 
I'll share a kiss with you on the moon.
