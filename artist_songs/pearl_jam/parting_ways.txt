behind her eyes there's curtains...
and they've been closed to hide the flames, remains...
she knows their future's burning, but she can smile just the same, same...
and though her mood is fine today 
there's a fear they'll soon be parting ways 
standing, like a statue 
a chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey... 
and though he's too big a man to say
there's a fear they'll soon be parting ways
drifiting away, drifting away, drifting away... 
drifiting away, drifting away, drifting away...
