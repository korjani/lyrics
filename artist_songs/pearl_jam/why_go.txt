She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday
Another child
Won't feel as alone as she does

It's been two years
And counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home...

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend
She could join the game
She could be another clone

Why go home?

What you taught me
Put me here
Don't come visit
Mommy dear
