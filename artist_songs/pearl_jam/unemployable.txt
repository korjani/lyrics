He's got a big gold ring what says "Jesus Saves"
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day
When he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss said, "You best be on your way"

Oh yeh
So this life is sacrifice

Oh yeh
Jumping trains just to survive

Well, his wife and kid are sleeping but he's still awake
On his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinking if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream?

Yeh,
So this life is sacrificed

Oh yeh
To a strangers bottom line

Yeh
I seen the light,... Uh-oh oh oh, Uh-oh oh oh
I's scared alive,...

Near to death,... Uh-oh oh oh, uh-oh oh oh
I seen the light,... scared alive

Yeh,
So this life is sacrificed

Oh yeh
They can't say I never tried

Yeh
I seen the light,... Uh-oh oh oh, uh-oh oh oh
I's scared alive,...

Near to death,... Uh-oh oh oh, Uh-oh oh oh
I seen the light.

Scared alive,...... Uh-oh oh oh, uh-oh oh oh
Near to death

Here to die.
Scared alive.

Near to death.
Hear to die.
Scared alive.
