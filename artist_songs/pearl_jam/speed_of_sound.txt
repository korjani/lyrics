Yesterdays, how quick they change
All lost and long gone now
It's hard to remember anything moving at the speed of sound
Moving with the speed of sound

And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
in that somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun that just don't come

Can I forgive what I cannot forget
And live a lie?
I could give it one more try

Why deny this drive inside, just looking for some peace
Every time I get me some it gets the best of me

I'm not much left, you see

And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
And that, somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word that never comes

A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts
I'm wide awake and reaching out

It's gone so quiet now
Could it be I'm farther out?

Movin' faster than the speed of sound
