Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before

Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No friends left at the crime

Our ship's come in and it's sinking
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the ending

Want a third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance

All good things come to an end
This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence

You think we've been here before
You are mistaken

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

When progress could be plausible
In the verse we curse ourselves
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the ending

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead

Time we best begin here at the ending
Here at the ending
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
