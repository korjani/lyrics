Love you like mad!

When am with you girl
Im down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

They way you turn me on
To the early morn

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

When im with you boy
Im down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

When you turn me on
To the break of dawn

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

One touch boy your making me quiver
Sweat is dripping down your face cant wait till you deliver
