In my mind
I can see reminders of a past decay
So far behind
Like the shadows linger at the close of day.
And we could see
We were timeless dreamers of another day.
And we were free
In a dawning age we had so much to say.

Oooh, the nights you came to me
A bluejean lady so eager to be free.
And the wind in your long hair blowin' as we stood for the band.

Oh, Hollyann.

Hollyann
We made the dark into light.
We saw the wrong and the right.
We were for life
And we would never concede it.

Hollyann
We left the world behind
A million hands gave the sign.
We held the line light
Can you believe it?
Hollyann
Hollyann

We could live
Just to turn the world into our fantasy.
And we could give
Aquarius was really meant to be.

You and I we were there to see the dawn.
Side by side we had love to carry on.
And I still hear guitars in the air as we sat in the sand.

Oh, Hollyann

Hollyann
We made the dark into light.
We saw the wrong and the right.
We were for life
And we would never concede it.

Hollyann
We left the world behind
A million hands gave the sign.
We held the line `/light
Can you believe it?
Hollyann
