Once I thought that life was easy
I thought love would be enough
Now I can't believe I'm on my own

I'm leaving on a jet plane
I'll wait in case you change you mind
You're all I can see when I'm all alone, ooh

Heaven on Earth (Couldn't we talk about it?)
I didn't know what to say
For what it's worth (I can't go on without it)
I never wanted to see you walk away

The sky is dark and angry
But I don't feel the rain
It's all the same, I miss your touch ... ooh

I feel like running somewhere
But I can't lose the pain I feel
I'm so far away, but I'm still in love, oh

Heaven on Earth (I can not live without it)
I didn't know what to say
For what it's worth (Now I just dream about it)
I never wanted to see you walk away

Are you looking for love? (Are you looking for love?)
Are you looking for love? (Are you looking for love?)
Are you even there?
I would come running from anywhere
Please say you won't give up

They tell me I'm no angel
But I've been waitin' long enough
We made it so far, I can't give up, ooh

Heaven on Earth
I didn't know what to say
For what it's worth
I never wanted to see you walk away

Hey, love should be enough
Oh, heaven on earth
Seems so easy
Heaven on earth, ooh
