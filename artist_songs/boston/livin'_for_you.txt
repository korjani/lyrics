Livin' without you never could be so wrong
Don't need to say it, I never waited so long
Thinking about you in everthing I do
Love is for givin'
You know I'm just livin' for you
And I, I never needed to lie
Can't you see I believe in my heart when I'm saying
It's love that you see
You're just the one for me
I'm praying

Maybe I'm dreaming, don't want to wake up now
Baby, I love you, I always knew it somehow
Happened so easy, don't need to think it through
It's not so amazing
Been going so crazy for you

Dreaming and hoping, hoping that dreams come true
You're my religion, girl, I've been living for you
Don't want to fight it, tried everything I know
I won't deny it
You're everywhere I try to go

And I, I never needed to lie
Can't you see I believe in my heart when I'm saying
It's love that you see
You mean the world to me
I'm praying for you

Knew it so easy, don't have to think it through
Love is for givin'
I know I'm just livin' for you

Love is for giving
I know I'm just livin' for you
