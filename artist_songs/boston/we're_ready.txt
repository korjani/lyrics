I'm ready for more
The feelin' now that I'm beside you
We'll open the door
Do anything that we decide to
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like I'm finally seeing the light
Holdin' on girl I know it's right
I know it's right
We're ready!

You and I
We'll find a reason
To simplify a change of season
And I feel like it's time we were off on our way
We can go so much farther than we've come today
Holdin' on girl and come what may
Come what may
We're ready! C'mon
We can find a way

We're ready now
Catchin' a wave to ride on
Steady now
headin' where we decide on
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like we're trying to do something right
Come on make it if we hold on tight
Hold on tight
We're Ready! C'mon We're ready
We're ready

We're ready, 1...2...3...4...

We can find a way. We're ready now, oooh we're ready now.

We're ready now.
