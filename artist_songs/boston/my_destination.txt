And
Feelin' the way I do
Wouldn't last a mile without you
When I'm losin' the way, the things that you say
Take me there
My destination
My destination
Is by your side
Right by your side

And I
I've taken so long, I know
Never had so far to go
It's not where you can be, it's what you can see
That takes you there
Your destination

Your destination
It's here inside, right here inside
