Just let me hear it from your lips
It's the last thing that I'll ask you to say
Don't wanna hear it from strangers
If it's over let me have it straight

I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news
(can't find me a reason for sure)

Don't tell me why
Yes it's over I can see the end
But please don't lie
If you're leavin' me like a friend

I've been tossed around plenty of times
And I've read between all the lines
You're just another in the grand design
And I've gotten used to bad news

I know what you're sayin' is bad
It's not what I wanted but I'm ready for that
I'm ready for that, yea.
