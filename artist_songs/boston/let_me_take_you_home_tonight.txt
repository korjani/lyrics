Now I'm not like this, I'm really kind of shy
But I get this feeling whenever you walk by
I don't wanna down you, I wanna make you high
If you you could see your way to me, come on and let me try.

Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight.

You must understand this, I've watched you for so long
that I feel I've known you, I know it can't be wrong
If we just get together, I want to make you see
I'm dreaming of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be

Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight.

I don't wanna make excuses, I don't wanna lie
I just got to get loose
With you tonight

Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight.

I don't wanna make excuses, I don't wanna lie
I just got to get loose
With you tonight

I don't wanna down you, I wanna make you high
And I get this feeling whenever you walk by
If we just get together, I wanna make you see
I'm dreamin' of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be.

Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight
I wanna show you sweet delight, show ya sweet delight
Pretty mamma wanna show ya sweet delight

Let me take you home tonight
You know I wanna take you home
Let me take you home tonight

Let me take you home tonight
Let me take you home tonight
Let me take you home tonight
