I didn't mean to fall in love
I didn't mean to fall in love

And all I mean to say
I can't go on the way things are
How can I lead the way
It feels so wrong to be so far away

Ooh, from you tonight
If I, if I lose you, I can't survive

Didn't know you would've come tonight
Didn't hang on long enough
Didn't want to go and start a fight
Didn't mean to go, go and fall in love

It's like an avalanche
Once you fall you're swept away
I didn't stand a chance
Hangin' on every word you say

Hey, we can find a place for love
Ooh, do you want it bad enough

I didn't mean to fall in love
I didn't mean to fall in love

So could you catch a plane
Come back home for one more try
I'll never be the same
I fell so hard out of the sky today

For you, you see
And you would never believe what you do for me
Can't you see you're all I need
Didn't know you would've come tonight
Didn't hang on long enough
Didn't want to go and start a fight
Didn't mean to go, go and fall in love
