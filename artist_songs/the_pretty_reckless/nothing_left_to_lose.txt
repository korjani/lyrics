I was only 19, you were 29
It's just 10 years, but its such a long time
In a heartbeat, I would do it all again

Late night sex, smokin' cigarettes
I try real hard but I can't forget
Now in a heartbeat, I would do it all again

Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose

After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose

Callin' out sins just to pass the time
My life goes by in the blink of an eye
I know you want me
I was only lookin' for a friend

And everything that I was
And everything that I've become
Just falls into the end and

Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose

Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left to lose
