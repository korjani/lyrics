Lay my head, under the water 
Lay my head, under the sea 
Excuse me sir, am I your daughter? 
Won't you take me back, take me back and see? 

There's not a time, for being younger 
And all my friends, are enemies 
And if I cried unto my mother 
No she wasn't there, she wasn't there for me 

Don't let the water drag you down (Don't let the water drag you down) 
Don't let the water drag you down 

Broken lines, across my mirror 
Show my face, all red and bruised 
And though I screamed and I screamed, well, no one came running 
No I wasn't saved, I wasn't safe from you 

Don't let the water drag you down (Don't let the water drag you down) 
Don't let the water drag you down 

Don't let me drown, don't let me drown in the waves, oh 
I could be found, I could be what you had saved 

Saved, saved, saved 

[Musical Break]

Lay my head, under the water 
Aloud I pray, for calmer seas
And when I wake from this dream, with chains all around me 
No, I've never been, I've never been free 

No, I've never been, I've never been free 
No, I've never been, I've never been free
