Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone

Let me open up the discussion with, I'm not impressed with any mother fucking word I say
See I lied that I cried when he came inside
And now I'm burning a highway to Hades
Shut the fuck up!
When I'm trying to think
I got to keep my concentration, give me one more drink
And then I'll try to remember all the advice that my good book told me

And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
Someone get me out of sun

Drugs, bars, backseats of cars
Blowing boys, what a boring life I've led so far
Just a prime thirteen when I rode his machine
Tried to keep my body dirty and my eyes closed and clean
So with a wink and a smile and a vial of meth
I took his hand and we walked through the shadow of death
And then I try to remember all the advice that my teacher told me

And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
And get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun [x2]

Deep, deeper, deeper inside
Pull the wool nice and tight so that it covers you eyes
Can't find a God, a love, a Jesus, a father
I don't even care that much
So why do I even bother?

So let me just end how I was gonna begin
Don't waste your time waiting cause I'm going back in

Now if I could just remember all the advice that my mother told me
And all the
And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me, just kill me)
Just get me out of the sun
(Kill me, just kill me)
Someone get me out of the sun
(Kill me, just kill me)
Someone get me out of the sun
