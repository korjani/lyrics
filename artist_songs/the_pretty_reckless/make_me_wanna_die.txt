[Verse 1]
Take me I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind
But everything looks better when the sun goes down

[Bridge + Chorus]
I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes
Your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die

[Verse 2]
Taste me, drink my soul
Show me all the things that I shouldn't know
And there's a blue moon on the rise

[Bridge + Chorus]
I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes
Your eyes everything in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes (burning in the light)
You make me wanna die

I would die for you my love, my love
I would lie for you my love, my love (make me wanna die)
I would steal for you, my love, my love (make me wanna die)
I would die for you my love, my love
Well burn up in the light

[Chorus]
Every time I look inside your eyes
I'm burning in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes
I'm burning in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die
