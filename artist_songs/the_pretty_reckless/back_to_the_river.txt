There's blue skies all around me
And the world looks just the same
It's hard to be criminal
when you all know my name
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I wanna be free
Well, you can be king of me
And I'll be the queen

No one listens to me
The words I have to say
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm just trying to get away
I'm going back to the river
Where no one will find me
We're going back to the river
Back to the sea

When I was just a baby
My mama taught me
"Girl, you best believe in Jesus
If you'll make it in the world"
I'm going back to the river
Where no one knows my name
I'm going back to the river
Back to the Seine
Here we go

There's blue skies all around me
And the world looks just the same
It's hard to be criminal
When they all know your name
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I wanna be free
Well, you can be king of me
And I'll be the queen

No one listens to me
The words I have to say
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm just fading into gray
I'm going back to the river
Where the devil can't find me
I'm going back to the river
Back to the sea
