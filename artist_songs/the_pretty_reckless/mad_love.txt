Love
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me

Like all of the orphans
I got none of the friends
I was alone until
You came and went
Now there's someone inside me
I think it's you
Won't let you go, babe
Until I am through with

Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Love

All of these voices
Debate in my head
One thinks I'm crazy
One thinks I'm dead
I am alive when I battle with you
You think you amaze me
I think that it's true
That

Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me

When you come around
I lose my mind from the sound
Of your voice and your laughter
I'll come right after
Your love

That your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Got nothin' on me
Ain't got nothin' on me
Love got nothin' on me
Got nothin' on me
Ain't got nothin' on me
Love got nothin' on me
