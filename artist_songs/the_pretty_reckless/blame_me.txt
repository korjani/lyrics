Sittin' in the back
Baby park it or drive
Breathing out the cracks just to stay alive
Earthquake body shake joke is all on me
I remember when I remember the time
Didn't have to take just to feel alive
Eyes black head back joke is all on me

Blame all your life on me [x2]
I gave it all for free
Blame all your life on me
All on me, oh [x2]

Everything I wanted was in my hand
I gave it all up for a better man
Who beat me down but on the ground I stand
Sitting in the back baby hardly alive
If I'm about to crack kick the pedal and drive
All this time the joke was all on me
Blame all your life on me
Just blame all your life on me
I gave it all for free
Blame all your life on me
All on me

Hit me with the wind again hit me with the wind I know
I have lost a friend again I have lost a friend I know how the
Story goes

You blame all your life on me [x2]
Cus I gave it all for free
So blame all your life on me
All on me, oh [x2]
It's all on me, oh
All on me, oh
