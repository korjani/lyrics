You can't trust a cold blooded man
Girl, don't believe in his lies
Can't trust a cold blooded man
He'll love you and leave you alive
There's one thing you must understand
You can't trust a cold blooded man

Can't trust a cold blooded woman
Boy, don't you lie in her bed
You can't trust a cold blooded woman
She'll love you and leave you for dead
There's one thing you must understand
You can't trust a cold blooded woman

And all the times I stayed and wonder why, are to blame, oh
And all the times that I'm reminded by, I'm ashamed, oh yeah

[Musical break]

You can't trust a cold blooded lover
You can't trust a cold blooded slave
You can't trust a cold blooded other
In the end they'll just drive you insane
There's one thing you must understand
You can't trust a cold blooded
Can't trust a cold blooded
Can't trust a cold blooded

Woman (man)

[Musical outro]
