High school nigga
And they're tryin to get the smoke outta the booth
But their not doing a good job
Ohhh, oh, oh, oh, oh ohh
My grades gettin low
But I'm still gettin high
It might seem slow
But time still goin byyyy
Hey
Oh and I forgot to mention
My girlfriends trippin
And my homies ain't acting the same
Well as long as there's papers and grinders
I'm taking my time and Imma roll my weed
And take one to the brain

[Hook:]
One more yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothin, but now I'm stuntin
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded

You know my money been kinda funny
But I'm still gettin fly
And uhm I don't got the best wheels
But the hoes still jump inside
Oh and I forgot to mention
My bestfriends trippin
Me I'm doing all that I can
But as long I stay on my grind
There's gonna be haters outsiders
Tryin to take my shine
And now their part of the plan

[Hook]

I guess if you insist I will
I'm a twister feel mista feel good to ya
I got it if ya need it and you kno I will
And this is after school so we gon go until
The janitor, handed her, a pack of that
Righteously she brought it all back to mac
So I'm a do it back to back, got her fat
Bags are packed, posted by the cafeteria
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack
Days goin to my nights, live a young wild life
King of the zoo
Devon what it do
Knockin all trees down, devin mac with the sac
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today
I got alot to say, I keep it locked away
That's how it is
Dealin with the pressures of my school life
Livin on the edge, joints to the head
And so the man said...
