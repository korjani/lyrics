Bank accounts big cars
Living good like a movie star
My mama house ain't in the hood no more
I moved her out to San Luis Obispo
But it's a trip though cause I'm a 20 Crip though
I gotta lay low my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I'm a get my third
These niggas snitching on me they think I'm selling birds
So when I'm in the streets I'm quick on my feet
See talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat
You niggas bad well Dogg is badder
Rat-a-tatter make you niggas scatter
I went shotta your boy want me now
Went to the station that nigga straight point me out
So I'm a lay away and spray away and spray away
Cause at this time I think it's best I just stay away

They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead

Separate elevate
Concentrate dominate and innovate
Try to be fly as me
And every other homie tell them lie to me
I need a deal I need some stones
I need some beats Dogg I need a loan
Help me out throw me some cash
If I got you got it and you ain't got to ask
But on the real or is it lately
A lot of homies they tried to implicate me
They say I am changed is it the fame
If I throw it to you then charge it to the game
Money fold overload
In the hood another episode
Man I'm getting old the game cold
Yeah I'm from the Dub but that ain't how I roll

They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead
