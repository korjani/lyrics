[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg:]
Top down, music loud
Leaves fall, don't quit
Coasting through my city
Doggy do what Diddy
What you hearing, what you heard
Turning this your learning curve
You could hooka, I'm a burn
Leaves with the Chronic herb
Laid back, listen to it
Show me how you wanna do it
If I like it, I'm a do it
If I don't, then I won't
Flick some ashes on the floor
Impala, '64
White on white, paint dripping
From the hood to the dough
Got a car full of gas but no place to go

[Hook:]
Coasting through the city with my top down
Looking back at all the years I worked my heart out
I give thanks to all my friends who stuck it out to see
The wings I grew for me
And you not come and fly with me
Coasting through the city with my top down
Looking back at all the years I worked my heart out
I give thanks to all my friends who stuck it out to see
The wings I grew for me
And you not come and fly with me

[Verse 2:]
Starting in the bend and a Mini Van (the taps in the box)
Torn down from the struggle but (I still never stop)
I worked three jobs at time, [?] notes and bills due
But don't give up, it's a process you gotta through (one step, two step, three step, four)
I've been boo'd off stage
Overlooked and underpaid
But now I'm standing in the booth next to Snoop Dogg (Snoop Dogg)
I've lost homies to the game
Seen the clouds and the rain
But did I mention I'm setting next to Snoop Dogg (Snoop Dogg)
Man got it good, he said I'm a champion
Before the Duncan came down with the "and one"
God is good, he said I'm a champion
Before the Duncan came down with the "and one"

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg:]
Sunset Boulevard
Give it to you real hard
Dolo on the solo
Riding around with no bodygaurd
Cadillac music
Lil' homie, we doos it
Yes sir, I'm dressed up
And I'm the freshest
Ain't no dust, we too clean to keep up
No cliques or broomsticks
Homie, we sweep up
Up close and personal
So ya'll can't peep us
Adidas sneakers
Real heat sneakers
Ear to the speaker
Let the ry get you
Stroll on or roll on or I'm a hit you
The sun going down but we still coming up
Make a run with us
Have some fun with us
Drop dead, top back, blowing in the wind
Rolling through the city with my newfound friend

[Outro:]
Snoop D, O, double G, just
October [?]
I'm the one that's [?]
Good looking out, huh
