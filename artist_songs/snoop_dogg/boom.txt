Get your money, whip ya hair
Executive branch blow my smoke like a player
Yeah in the club, yes it cracks
Cute little mama, but they stack with backs
I'm smokin' great purple urple
You and Doggie world come and join my circle
I'll break down herbal til I move like a turtle
My money is green and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Maybe it's the lawyer, her body's the truth

I'm in the game for real, it pay's to chill
I walk in the club and they front the bill
I'm the big dogg, best beware
You're coming with me, if you stop the stare
She'll be on my team in my car on the way to the spot
Yes you are, toasting up, posting up
And when we're done, we west coasting love
For shendo blowin' endo,
How much for the Dog in the window

[Hook]
oh. what?
Boom!
Boom!
Say what? say what?
Boom!

Talk to 'em T-pain

[T-pain - Hook]
Baby I'm a Dogg! (I'm a Dogg!), beware! (beware!)
I'll do whatever, however I want! (I want!)
This one for y’all (this one for y’all!), oh yeah! (oh yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air, now whip your hair and go
La la la la la
Boom shakalaka when I drop all of my apples, say
La la la la la
One aint a quitter, shawty know that I ain't playin

[Snoop]
I'm all about the money, the money I got
On the VIP tip, Maserati in the lot
Kill 'em with stars where the bottle never stops
Got a model on my lap, Baby show me what you got
With a cup of landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it today
Real tough, this suites is next
One more drink gon' lead to sex
These girls is bad, the flow is pack?
They shut the Dogg down when he reach the max
Whatcha trying to drink? Clearer yet
She got Apple Bottom, homie, all I need to do is mack
I does it well, your game is whack
I guess to the bit is no chit chat
Now where do we go? I beats the gush
She's in love with the gangster, that's what up

That's what up. Boom!
That's what up. Boom!
That's what up. Boom!

Speak to 'em T-pain

[T-pain - Hook]

[Snoop]
Boom shakalaka here comes the chief like I smoke good
with T-pain, Snoop Dogg, we doctor
Big 808 now filled the basin in ya chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta
Coke bottle shape like green eyes
Drunk offa love like a colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs
I'm gonna smoke til I die
Just bust a bad one for my homie D-Dimes
Boom!
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains,
You ever taste purple rain
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, it's still a G-Thang
Lil mama whip ya hair
Exhale the Chronic as the smoke disappears
I'm ready to ball
Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

[T-Pain - Hook]
