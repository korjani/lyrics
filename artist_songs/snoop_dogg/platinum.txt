Platinum through the doors

V12 rollin' nigga goin' platinum

[R. Kelly:]
Swag like a lighter
And I keep my swag lit
Man I'm on fire
That can't tell a nigga shit
V12 rolling
Got some honeys up in it
Say your pussy golden
But I only fuck with platinum chicks
Only talk platinum shit
Only swallow platinum spit
Speak my own slang-uage
Still I am the real-iest
Surrounded by Ciroc but your boy sipping Hennessy
Loves is a hospital and I was born in V.I.P.
Sick and there's no cure
Bad case of V.I.P.
Still in the game killing you can call us M.V.P.
Whole fucking club jump in your cars and follow me
It's dude from the Chi and the D.O. double G.

Fixing the ball drifting listen dawg

Hoes on the street cause they all wanna make that trip to the promised land
Little mama can give it to me like I'm the man
