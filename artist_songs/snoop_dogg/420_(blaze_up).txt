[Snoop Dogg:]
Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat back to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana

[Devin The Dude:]
I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like my & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up
So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na

Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight
