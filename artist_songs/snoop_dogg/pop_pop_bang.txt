[Hook x2:]
Pop Pop Bang
Do my Diddy
Claim my gang
Rep my city

One, two, three it's me
Baby bopper, I'm hot as lava, I gotta be
Eight bottles, a lot of models, a pot of bean[?]
Top dollar, the blue impala, know what I mean?
Drifting away, you, you can't keep running away
I wanted to say, we play the original way
Either you stay, lay the pistol or pay
We official, okay?
I got cooked up dope sent down from the bay
From my cousin Ricky, with the sticky icky
West coast baby girl, come and fuck with me

[Hook x2]

People come from everywhere to get a dose of the Cali life
Like palm trees and bomb weed
Riding on that sunset night
Home of the crips, yeah cuz that's us
Relative, gotta live, what it do blood?
Only grind one time, yeah that's the digs[?]
Better get some heat, when you're creeping through the beach
To each his own, the leash is long
Turn it up and get your T.C on
And tell em' Snoop Dogg sent him to the block
Let it rock while it not
Motherfucker, show you how to west coast

[Hook x2]

[Daz:]
Homie keep it gangster, tell me how do these feel
Pop pop bang, swing it on three wheels
House party g[?], we raised off of g-shit
When it's time to get at it, you know we get sea-sick
We with the business by any means necessary
You can't fuck with us homie, we'll [?] and make it scary
I popped her cherry, and she gave it up in a flash
We wanna bang with Snoop, we wanna bang with Daz
Hop inside a g-ride and glide, take a voyage
Back to the east side, east side's where we're going
Where the hustlers [?] us raw with no worries at all
When you learn to see [?] before you learn to crawl
