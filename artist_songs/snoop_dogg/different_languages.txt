you make me say [x3]
oh
you make me say [x3]

[Chorus:]
I’m from the East Coast but I’m falling so hot a nigger got me crib walking
I’m from the suburbs but it's that good you make a good girl wanna get to the hood
you make me say [x3]
so good got me speaking different languages

is you alive
like a side du
all I wanna do is like be inside you
ride you
try to find you
fill you
revive you
going with your bad self baby cause I do adore
and I give you more
put it on you all the time you know me a more
we got for sure, pure, alivea lore
don’t trip I ain't leaving you for
Jake got Beyonce I got Shante
with no entree that's my baby
you know the thing about
when I bring em out feels so good I had to sing about
get it get it now
we flying out of town checking in the suite
pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down

[Chorus]

is it the way you look
is it the way you walk
is it the way you cook
is it the way you talk
I think it's all of the above
no play time in the day time making love
kids go to school
we can act a fool
skinny dip in the pool
do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down

[Chorus]

hey baby
oh oh oh oh
you got me going outta my head
oh oh oh oh oh
you got me saying thing I don't understand
ladies, if your man make you say, he hear to stay, he's hear to stay [x2]

oh oh yes I am
this my plan
you my girl, I’m your man
take your pain
take my hand
take my name
make my kids
do your thing
ain't no game
show no shame
if I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
so I got you got 2 1 2
put your face on my back brand new tattoo
20 year in the game what love won't do
a lot of women want me but I want you
you look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows
nowadays I ain't moving that wow
I changed my style it might happen to you
what gotten to me shit I gotten to you
and start raping about things like love and being true
now maybe we could make another baby or two

[Chorus]

you make me say [x3]
so good got me speaking different languages
