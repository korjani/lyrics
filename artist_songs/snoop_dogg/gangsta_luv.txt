Radio Killa, Big Snoop D O dub
The American Dream

Ayo nephew, come up off them keys
Sing a lil' somethin' for the ladies
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Let 'em know how we feelin' right now

Every time I go around, shawty love me down
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doin'
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout

That gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love

Yeah, she love it the way I put it on her
Blowin' trees, summer breeze, sippin' Corona
Lost dog I give it to her right and she like it
She on the hip like a psychic, izzy

One of the coolest of fool on the flow
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?
I bowled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that low dress on you comin' up outta there, yeah

She like that, you like that
You say you bite, well, I bite back
And I'm all go, we can do it till tomorrow
I beat it up like Harpo

Snoopy, I go hard, baby, yes
Kissin' on yo' chest and I'm diggin' out your stress
I won't stop till yo' finished
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it, Dream

Every time I go around, shawty love me down
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doin'
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout

That gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love

She always cold in the middle of the night
'Cause I'm a dogg, I'm a give her what she like
She say my name loud, I say her name low
That's what I aim fo', that's how the game go

Baby like the way I wake her up
'Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up just to put her to sleep

Everyday is the same thang, I creep in
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the LB raisement
We was taught to dig 'em down crazy

Lights out, I'm so lit
Mama's so gone, daddy won't quit
I won't stop till you're finished
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it, Dream

Every time I go around, shawty love me down
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doin'
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout

That gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love

This the life that you show
The loop, the coop, the grows
Anything goes
It's so good got her wigglin' her toes

The boss, the dream
The floss, the cream
The trips overseas
All these things really don't mean a thing

When I'm tearin' that ass up workin' you like a shift
I give it to you like a gift
You hear what that boy say, you wouldn't jack, give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back

Snoopy you're so good, she screamin' and I like that girl
She off in another world
I ain't stop till you're finished
She love this gangsta especially when I'm in it, Dream

Every time I go around, shawty love me down
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doin'
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout

That gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love

Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love
