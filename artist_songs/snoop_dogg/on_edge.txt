(...sleeping at night
I have visions of you
I make believe we’re running away
To a world of fantasy)

[Kali Uchis:]
Let me [?] something that has seemed to got my mind for this
Early in the morning, and I'm cruising down to your address
Fucking up my intellect, but you know I'm into it
Nobody can stop me, maybe you should join my syndicate

[Kali Uchis:]
On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on it on it
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to, supposed to!
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on edge
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to!
May we turn the time back?
Riding in, my time machine
No, I don't need the Maybach
And we're riding dirty, but I didn't need to say that
I don't know this girl, but she's claiming that we go way back!

[Snoop Dogg:]
Denise, Latrice, none to say the least
I'm feeling like an interview, I really don't remember you!
Sigh, aye bae, what you're feeling dude?
I'm running that bind trying to get into you
They call me Mr. Rich Roller
We say, he say, baby you a chola
Swole up, mix the Hennessey with Cola
Lil momma, hold up, now baby, put the gold up!
Yeah, lil momma [?] she mix the molly with meds
And now she probably on edge
Uh, see, ain't no selling it dog
I put the pale on the log, see ain't no telling involved

[Kali Uchis:]
On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on it on it
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to, supposed to!
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on edge
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to!
May we turn the time back?
Riding in, my time machine
No, I don't need the Maybach
And we're riding dirty, but I didn't need to say that
I don't know this girl, but she's claiming that we go way back!

On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!
