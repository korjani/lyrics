[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoopy, is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies on my head like a kooflee, my nigga kid cudi,
That's my little buddy,
Call some hoe's up and get some cudi cudi,
What yo life like, mine is kinda tight,
A long way from hustlin, a china white,
My people love, the fans love me I'm all go,
If you ain't showin love then what did you call for,
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price,
So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone,
Dog on the throne I'm world-wide known and a boss in the zone,
I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn the spot,
You see the plans, I'm just fuckin with my fans,
I turned out to be a better man, important for life,
You understand while I'm puffin on this gram

[Chorus:]
Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,
Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,
The code in which I roll, it's so simple what I need,
I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I got my fam dog, look at my niggas,
Got little money dogg but I ain't tripping,
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,
Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,
Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,
The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,
Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,
Made it to the top baby, that's on me,
Cops trying to claim that they made me,
I want you to feel another real for gaizing,
I keep it one hundred, never frontin, don't need me,
I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,
Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,
The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,
And I rep the double O, smoking, eating cherrios

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,
The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',
Nigga, it's nuthin for me to chill out and post up at the house,
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,
Hollywood nice now,
Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,
Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, "How to get rich and stay cool",
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,
I was tappin all the Choanies,
Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,
Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,
Love of my life while I'm puffing on the good weed

[Chorus]

[Outro x2:]
Snoop dogg in the house tonight blowing that laker crip that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now Would you? Would you? Right?
