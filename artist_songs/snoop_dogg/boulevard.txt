[Hook:]
As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy

[Verse 1:]
Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town
Survived the School of Hard Knox but still came up and made his chips
The realest life, never watch it down
Walk with a gun through the heart of town
We hearin bam bam bam, a familiar sound
To the youth down in the gully where Johnny boy done grow
He never thought that he would make it out
It's crabs in the barrel down in ST close

[Hook:]
As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy

[Verse 2:]
Poor Johnny Johnny got stuck for his money
Things get funny when you rump with the daddy
Later on the goons pull up in the black Caddy
Next step on the news them find another dead body
Tales for the inner city
We break it right down to the nitty glitty
Who's responsible for the crime and poverty?
What a tragedy
Wayoo

[Verse 3:]
I wish that I could singlehandedly free the entire planet
Turn from crying man poverty
Love me when the love he say they near
When we burn real seize and jealousy unheard
And you take me one, you are part of this effect
Come into slavery, we would be emancipated
If they break our eggs then co-operate
Not a gyal stop me from achieving the greatest

[Hook:]
As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy
