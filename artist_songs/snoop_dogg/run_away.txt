[Snoop Dogg & Gwen Stefani:]
Let's forget where we are and what's goin' on
Let's forget who we are and who we know
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby we can escape, run away with me

[Pre-Chorus - Snoop Dogg (Gwen Stefani):]
You like the way that I dress (you love the way that I see)
You love the things that I do (yes but I love that you are free)
You love the way I think (for people everywhere)
We're approaching the brink but who cares
The world is getting ablaze, yea (x2)

[Chorus - Snoop Dogg & Gwen Stefani:]
Run away, run away with me
Come and play, come and play with me
Run away, yes do the day with me
Let's escape, yes do the day with me

[Snoop Dogg & Gwen Stefani:]
Let's forget who we were and wanted to be
Let's forget who was there, trust me please
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
They won't put their guns away, run away with me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg & Gwen Stefani:]
I don't understand why do they live so violently
Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
