Oooh Oooooh.
Close the door
I'mma goin in
And that for sure
Gonna lay ya out out out
And I know you luv a nigga breakin it down
Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk

You know who I am I'm the mothafockin dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You hit a bedspreak all way down the street
It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat
I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth
I told you before I don't luv them ho's
But she got that good good can't let 'r go
And I gotta let 'r know

Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for..
And I got that fire luvin', the more you need the more
Oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah
Everytime she's with me, me I'm dizzy

Shoot to the spot cause the spot is the lick
Pull your lunchbreak lemme hit it real quick
Back to your job before they know what is
Luvin so good, we already made three kids
I dont know what it is but I luv what I did
Huggin and touchin' and all that shit
Drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill
Yea this for you boo it's a gift

Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for..
And I got that fire luvin', the more you need the more
Oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah
Everytime she's with me, me I'm dizzy
