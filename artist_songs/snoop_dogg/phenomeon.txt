Shabba
And how you keep on doin the things that you do
What I do?

[Hook x2:]
Don't stop keepin it on and on
What do you see?
Something like a phenomenon

Hey girl
(Hey girl you know I'm talkin to you over there, come on over)
Yea, you know I got that shit
(You know we got that shit, go on and blaze up)
Don't trip
If you ain't bout this shit
(If you ain't bout it, don't be about it)
Nigga tell em who I am

You the muthafuckin man dawg, that shit ain't hard to see
And what you do on the daily what them other fools try to be
Ain't comparison, Adidas yea we bearin em
Smoking on that medicine
Tell them muthafuckas let us in

This is what I need from ya'll
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air

[Hook x2:]
Don't stop keepin it on and on
What do you see?
Something like a phenomenon
Baby what'll it be?
Hey girl
Yea, you know I got that shit
Don't trip
If you ain't bout this shit
Nigga tell em who I am

[Daz Dillinger:]
When I was a little baby boy
My mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turn tables with the mix and I learned to rhyme like a dolomite
Time went by in a fly creation
I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do
Put on some gray and blue and made my own crew

And since you dig, your shit on hit and this is how we rock
I chitty bang my city man and this is for the block
Equipped to hit, I get you whipped and spit that shit you like
I'm on like superfly tonight
Cus I don't have no kryptonite

[Bridge]
