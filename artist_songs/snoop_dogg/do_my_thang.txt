[Intro:]
Let me do my thang
‘Cause I’mma do my thang
Let me do my thang
(Do your natural thang)
Can I do my thang?
Let me do my thang

[Hook:]
Stay on the low, we get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
I bust a new batch, get it back just like that
Let me do my thang
I’m hard in the bank, never say what a nigga can’t
Do my thang, do my thang
Yea I’mma do my thang
I’mma do my thang
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang

[Verse:]
Get a biatch, got a biatch
This shit, yea I got a lot of it
Money up, nah money back
I don’t tolerate none of that
Fill half a C and enjoy
And roll wit your motherfuckin homeboys
Dam-Funk drive the car
I’m smoking that blaze up like by afar

[Hook:]
Do my thang
Yea I’mma do my thang
Let me do my thang
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang

[Verse:]
1-2, 1-2
Me and Dam came to funk you
I know you love everything that we does
This shit bang in the club
And ain’t no need to procrastinate
We on the 40 ounce, my nigga pass the A
And let me get yo back to the floor
Life when I was a young G back in ‘84

[Hook:]
Do my thang
Yea I’mma do my thang
Let me do my thang
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang

Greeting nebulons
It is I, Seth Me
You are now ordered to do your thing
Oh no
Your thing is your friend
Only you can do you
So do it do it do it

[Hook:]
Let me do my thang
Do my thang
Yea I’mma do my thang
Let me do my thang
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
I but a new batch, get it back just like that
Let me do my thang
I’m hard in the bank, never say what a nigga can’t
Let me do my thang
Do my thang
Yea I’mma do my thang
Let me do my thang
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go
Let me do my thang
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets
Let me do my thang
