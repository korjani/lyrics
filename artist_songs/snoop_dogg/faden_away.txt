[Hook]
Faden away
And I can't go another day
You make it hard to stay away
Girl you've got me faden away
Girl you've got me faden away
And ain't no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you've got me faden away
Faden Away

[Verse 1]
In my mind, it's all about you
I don't know what to do
Cuz you have got me confused
We talking on the phone
We fussing fight you ‘bout that lightening
I just wanna love you right, love you right

[Hook]
Faden away
And I can't go another day
You make it hard to stay away
Girl you've got me faden away
Girl you've got me faden away
And ain't no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you've got me faden away
Faden Away

[Verse 2]
Make time, make love, that’s what we make
Looking nowadays, looking like it’s gonna fade
See me, will you see here G soul
If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough
What a brother know, keep it on the low
That’s what my grandma said it suppose to go
Feel the same, we toast and post it
And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost
Me and damn phone we capture the phone
Collusion, illusion, set it all foe
Plan with me, for your best, let it all go
The beach and the wind you blow

[Hook x2]
Faden away
And I can't go another day
You make it hard to stay away
Girl you've got me faden away
Girl you've got me faden away
And ain't no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you've got me faden away
Faden Away

[Outro]
It’s so hard to stay with you girl
It’s even harder to play with you girl
It’s so hard to stay with you girl
And even harder to play with you girl
Faden away
Faden away
Faden away
Faden away
Faden away
Faden away
Faden away
