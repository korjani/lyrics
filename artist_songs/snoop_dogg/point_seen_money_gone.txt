[Jeremih:]
Let me be the man and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown
Won't you come straight to California
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world get nasty
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be
No, no, no, no, no, no
That's where the cash be

[Snoop Dogg:]
Mula, fetty, you not ready
I'm a get the cheese but the bread was spaghetti
Letti said he can play with them broads
Opportunistic I stay on them hoes
I ain't got time to be handing with y'all
'Specially when there is no money involved

Joint seem mighty long
Red beam on his dome
Point seen money gone

[Jeremih:]
Let me be the man and get the money

When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown
Won't you come straight to California
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world get nasty
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be

[Snoop Dogg:]
Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow
Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
El Bueno, hustle like Maino
All money in, no draino
Cato, body, get it like I get mines
Smoke papers, Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shake it, or make it
Never had to fake it to make it
Just put the pedal to the metal rock it up to get flakey
I'm living the fast life
Jet after jet and try to keep my cash right
I know you understand the meaning
Hand full of green and while the fans keep feigning
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at
Or even in the hood where the crips at

Joint seem mighty long
Red beam on his dome
Point seen money gone

[Jeremih:]

And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be
No, no, no, no, no, no
That's where the cash be

[Snoop Dogg:]
All right now I need passion to the stage
Destiny, Melia, Passion
I need y'all to the stage let's go
I need y'all on the stage let's go
Work, work, work

In a white ghost sipping holy water
Always been the type to get it close to porters
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park, I got hits
What you mean? I through the tarp
At the wall, off the wall
I feel like Mike, I don't miss
Niggas talkin' shit
Saying I didn't fuck that pussy into one-nighty
HItting that pussy quit was just aight, uhh
Not at all I ain't get to see the wall
I cocked 'em off, fuck them all
Fuck the law, fuck you thought
I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car
Flashy man, flashy this and dancing on me
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
Lemonade to niggas that be acting tough
See you got money I just double up
Multiply, fuck addition, fuck your position
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches
This the life, then walk away it's so delicious
Up in Dubai, Sushi hella bitches
Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas, lean lean
Tell em' I need two shots, or two o' clock
Plus that adds about 2000, teardrops
Pull up with my crew in silent nights

[Jeremih:]
I need a girl who will do whatever I want
I need a girl who will do whatever I want
