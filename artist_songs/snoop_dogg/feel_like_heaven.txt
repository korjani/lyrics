Ride with you niggas like
Slide off that you're feeling right
All we got is you and me
I know what you need, girl
Smoke you some weed, girl
Sit back, let me take your time!
Impress the ladies, ain't no questions, baby
I got the answer for you and me
I put a smile on your face, let me take you to a place
Make you feel like Heaven!

Put your make-up and your Gucci on
Rock star like, baby, camera, lights, movie's on!
Plus, I feel the vibe of what you want
You be doing that that cool thing
All the grown, new thing
I got you coming back, turn around, boomerang
Underground doing things
Girl, I know you like that
Don't get tough, sweet like a
Nigga like a track store, afraid to..
Try to catch a milly on! (Slow it down!)
Baby, let me catch up with you
Get that cake up, leg it down, wake up with you
Stand down, and taste the picture
I got a cool lil' skirt because I'm damn that mister!
I keep my plan on focus, my focus is you
We're cool as a one bo, we're cool as a two
Baby had your phone and I let it do what it do
I'm sitting in my whip outside, now step out and just

I like your flavor, you step your game up
Welcome to the majors with Soopafly, look alive!
We bang at the house, swimming pool, sip or die
Look at you, look at mine, looking good, wish you would!
Take it off, slide on me!
Work it like a Romeo, glide on it, make it cream
Double stuffed Oreo
I'm like the Mario, I got my chest out
Macking while I sit back, you can pull the rest out
I'm like a star is born, and I'm the next out
Pray to get your next out, slide to the left and
Now I'm looking at your best friend
Shoot back! I look at the mess we're in
And I don't play no games, though
Plus, that ain't what I came for
(No) I wanna slide out, smoke with you
Rub on your angle
Then give me head like a bankroll
I got a cool disposition, girl
I like you right in this position, girl
I'm the boss, get submissive, girl
Make you drop, turn around, it's your world
So you can just
