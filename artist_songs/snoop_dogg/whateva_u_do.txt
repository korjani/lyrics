Kids get your parents permision befor.fore.befo.fo.before tryin' this,

Half of the hoes and the music goin bang
Everybody everybody yeh we all doin everything
So u kno wats happenin, there no need to pitty-pat
Dogg in this motherfucker, yeh I get da kitty-kat
Swervin on da one-ten blowin on some herb
One hand on the steerin wheel the other up her mini skirt
Tryna get some pussy while I'm pushin my wherree
Funny thing about it is that I'm fuck your bitch
Ok yo, hoe lay low, get mayo, like OJ yo, say hoe
Plug it in, pull it out, put it in, wat it is, that's wat it's all about
Now wat would I be if I let a punk motherfucker run up on me
I play chess checkmate him in the street, 32 fever off blast that's three
Swish swish fresh fish ain't that a bitch, like ray-jay I gotta run which
Look at the place I'm in, I never fuck superhead acam crawdashier
It's a discrace to yourself, dogg is the champ to the face with the belt
I'm undefeated, undisputed, persicuted, spaded and neutered; faded and booted

[Chorus:]
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that wateva u do

Put ya hands in the sky, stick up, pick up piece of american pie
Wat kind of car do ya drive?
Suicide doors on the passenger side?
Do the windows roll down? do the doors lift high?
Do the car change colour when that bitch drive by?
I don't really know an I don't really care
Cause me and my money's like sonny and cher
Spend dow at the goochy store
I never spend dow on the coochy though

You can check it, I got a record in brazil
For runnin out and not payin the bitches
Juvinial delinquint, see when I speak dis
Move when I bleep dis
Lil nigga peep dis
Ya secrets is all exposed

If ya grew up on ma music
Ya mumma's one of ma hoes
Ya daddy's one of ma foe's
Ya granny's been to one of ma shows

It is contrary that my literachary
Is very nesesary, ya feel me?
An you can try to rewind it, define it
Deside it to a whole notha groove
Play it to anotha move
Hope ya go through
Cause ya won't strike two
With twelve jury's up your piers
You better hope they like you
Ain't no tellin wat they might do
So I'm gonna just stay out their mothafucka way view
Dippin in an outta town
Gotta get a hundred thou
Even if it's just for a setta

I been blessed by kings and kissed by queens
Even got a homie named prince akeem
Yes, I mean black diamonds
I can have anything, yep
There's twenty game
Even if I coulda of I would of never stopped
Started on the bottom, now they got him on the top
Sensation, big snoop dogg rattin number one in the nation
Top draft pick, always got a top bad bitch
Every time u see me, niggas wanna be me
It ain't that easy, it's still hard bein Snoop D O mothafucker double G

[Chorus:]
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
