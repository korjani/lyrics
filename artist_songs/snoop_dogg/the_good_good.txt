[Verse 1:]
Spades like these occasions I love
Running round going nowhere
Glad I get to spend all your time
Probably cause I know that I'm the one that makes you smile
I love the way you say my name
And how you laugh at all the stupid things I say
It's all lovin, no hate

Hanging out with you
While you hanging hanging on my arm
And I like it
Your hand on my back
While we drivin drivin in my car
And I like it

[Chorus:]
This is the good good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong
Gotta keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye

[Verse 2:]
Anytime I'm feeling alone
They'll be a text from you on my phone
Just to say you're thinking of me
And when we're in the club I know it's only me you see
Love the way you have my back
And how when I make no sense
You still understand
When nobody else can

Hanging out with you
While you hanging hanging on my arm
And I like it
Your hand on my hand
While we kissing kissin in the dark
And I like it

[Chorus:]
This is the good good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong
Gotta keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye

[Bridge:]
Oh this love
Is the best love that can ever be
And I get high on you and me
Anyone can see
This is the good good

[Chorus: x2]
This is the good good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong
Gotta keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye
Keep it strong
Keep keep it going on ye
