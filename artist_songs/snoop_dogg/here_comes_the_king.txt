[Intro: Angela Hunte]
Show no fear, we made it clear
That the warriors are comming and we no play

[Hook: Angela Hunte]
We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill em we just smoke 'em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king [X2]

[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
Here I come a steppin inna the dance
Here I come a steppin inna the dance
Posted up the wall here inna mi stance
Posted up the wall here inna mi stance
We never fail, we only shine with brilliance
One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution
One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution

[Hook: Angela Hunte]
We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill em we just smoke em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
You might be a lord; but here comes the king

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
They gonna love me
Call me black chutney
All gold chrome with the diamonds in the back
Lil homies in the front don't know how to act
We comin deep and you never see us smiling
10 million strong and it will rumble when we are riding
Two shots up for my africans
Been around the world and back again
Feel so good gotta let me in
Power to the people let em kiss the ring
Bow - here comes the king

[Hook: Angela Hunte]
We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill em we just smoke em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
You might be a lord; but here comes the king

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]
They know me in japan and pakistan
Ganja makes me lord of all the land
I'm royalty no need for me to wear a crowm
Born a rebel then I became a man
I heard a voice, he said that I would understand
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution

[Hook: Angela Hunte]
We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill em we just smoke em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
