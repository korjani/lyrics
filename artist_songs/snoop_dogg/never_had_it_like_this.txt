You never had it like this

You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull[?] with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it

Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women

[T Fly:]
Girl I do you the way, you want me to
Put them panties right to a side

Keep going I have to tell your homegirl, do you over
The best it's on the west side baby
And these niggas over here keep you goin crazy
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg:]
Walked in the club with it
Gave her straight dick, you in love with her
My homie G-d up at the club with her
Eight seven six months, sold drugs with her
A good girl, is what she wants, no molly, no drink, and no bud
So I don't really wanna try to learn you on
A lot of things I'm tryna do is just to turn you on
If I can get you to my flat on my futon
Take your dress [?] off slow and get my groove on
Hit you with the bife [?] face
Stick it to the baby in the right place

[Hook]

[Warren G:]
On the roof top she gonna need that
Eighty seven was wild I use to be that
I'm givin the D she giving feed-back
The homies is wild, where the weed at?
And where the home girls? I don't even know
I had two off they cushing [?] Moscato
A ratchet or a model, we drinking out the bottle
My whole act to follow, more booze than Apollo [?]
Yeah I'm a G I'm a monster baby
I ain't see that piece of ass I can't conquer baby
Probably hiding on these hoes like a jack rabbit
Snoop and Warren on these hose back to back in it

[Hook x2]
