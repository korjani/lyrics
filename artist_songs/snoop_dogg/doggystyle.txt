[George Clinton:]
Yeah, this is a story about a famous dog
Doggy Dogg that is
That smooth macadamian, a.k.a Silky Slim
Back in the motherfuckin' house for nine-trey
Why must he be like that?
Why would any other dog hit it from the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby

[George Clinton (Jewell):]
(Oh I, oh I) It's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
Doggystyle (I)
Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle
(Oh I, oh I) Yeah it's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
It's Doggystyle yay (I)

[Snoop Dogg:]
It's like tonight is the night by Betty Wright
It's my first piece of ass and it's awfully tight
But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
Feeling that pussy, yes y'all
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang
Reminiscing 'bout the first time Doggy Dogg came

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Memory lane, memory lane, Doggystyle)
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Down memory lane, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah) I (yeah, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, (yeah) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah, Doggystyle)
I (Doggystyle)

[Snoop Dogg:]
It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She gazing in the mirror and shit
Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing is shit is

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(I can see it)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(Doggystyle, Doggystyle)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(Yeah)

[Snoop Dogg:]
A little something for the bitches thats down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Erin ho
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your [?] tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
Oh I, oh I (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle, doing it Doggystyle) I (do it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I (oh let me feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(I can see it, I can see it) I
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (Doggystyle)
I (Doing it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh (doing it Doggystyle)

Oh I, oh I (oh I want to feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh
