[October London:]
As we go on... (We go on)
Like we do... (Like we do)
When it's hot outside... (Hot outside)
I just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)
What you need? (What you need?)
Is put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)
Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride...
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
(If you feel the same, then let me know)
I wanna rock ya, girl... (Oh!)
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

[Snoop Dogg:]
You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good
Stop, now, top down through the neighborhood
Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I'll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear
This that time of the year
For everybody to be boisterous
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this

[Snoop Dogg:]
Shined up my white walls, night falls
I'm feeling hella good
I'm doin thangs that you never would
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more
It's me and mines, it's summertime
You go off and we go on
