Tell me way you smoking good out of side in the hood
Pocket's tight you should could put that money on the wood
Take a flight, take a trip, you just might take a flip
We just might take a zip, we gonna ask different shit

[Hook:]
I'm smoking weed n wax, weed n wax, paper shit
I'm smoking weed n wax, wax, wax

[Soopafly:]
Baby turn around to the other shit blow smoke
I would into agresive just blow it enough don't make her show
Just sit back you daddy, then I'm blind when you look at the miles
I said yeah you've been a drip, grab a homie young teddy bear
Your head it's fair, she ask if she can roll another blug
I'm like I don't care, the way you try this
No way blood, no weed, no liedest
A little something I'll be blow and browing
With a free hand, we still run and pull, I'mma G
Took a little hit, baby look at me like I'm a bullshit
But I'm not, come close and show you what I got
Baby this right here is wax
Make it down from the crowdy
Is it better when I smoke your sac
Hold that, but now just perform it
Turn that ass round baby touch on it
While I pull take another pull
Don't wanna put too much on it
But when I look at you you're so beautiful
So after all this dick you get
You can smoke all this streaky stack
We'll be on the same vibe and maybe it's no coincidence
We like your mind take a trip
Purple kush make it bitch
We're the wax paper shit

[Bridge:]
We're the wax paper shit, we'll be right smoking
Out of side in the hood
Pocket's tight you should could put that money on the wood
Take a flight, take a trip, you just might take a flip
We just might take a zip, we gonna ask different shit

Fresh shoose, design clothes, now hit, desing this whores
Two times, six ooh so fance so quick drop on the club
I got a brand new hit
Weed n wax it's what I blow
All kush and dope
Yeah that is, what that is?
Like that bitch, there I go
Mary candy out it in the mix
Feels so good it should be fix
Wanna get the truth fine to get
Stop getting to much low
Now tell me what to do
Calm it down, break it up, take a patch, now pass it on acid
It's dri shit, it's clasic, it's magic
Flow and get you til
Flatery in that hole never got me see
That will me breath taking, cake baking
Bread, eg, cheese and baking
French toast, west coast, eath quakling, trippulating
Never in to take it, guapalating,...
While we popping, we make it
Now we down to make it, turn your TV only, we on it
Television station, DG air
Tell her friend we never be electronic , blowing out the G
