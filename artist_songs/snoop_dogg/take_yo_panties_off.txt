[Chorus - Snoop Dogg (Craig Robinson):]
Girl you know you get me off
Girl, it's nothing to a boss
Give it to ya nice and soft
Take your panties off...
(You are beautiful, you are wonderful)
(I adore you, I appreciate you)
Girl I'm off this alcohol, leaning up against the wall
Put your hands up on my balls
And take your panties off...
(You are beautiful, you are wonderful)
Slip 'em to the side, girl (I adore you)
Let me slip inside, girl (I appreciate you)
(She is your queen, she is my diva)
Take your panties off (she is my queen)
Slip 'em to the side, girl (she is my diva)
Let me slip inside, girl

[Verse 1 - Craig Robinson:]
The problem that I seem to have
Each and every time I try
To break down what I'm thinking
Girl, you know you got my eye
I gotta see what's under there
I gotta take my time too
So come on, baby, come tonight
And please take off your panties too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Craig Robinson:]
Somebody told me one time, ask
Ask and you shall receive
So this is me being very polite
Take your panties off, please
First you say yes, and then you say no
And we ain't goin' tit for tat
You might think that, you being cute
But baby, ain't nobody got time for that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg:]
Pancakes and that NESQUIK
Mouth full of that lipstick
Play your cards right
And you just might get yourself that dipstick
Lick me, lick me, lick me up
And you can lick me down
And let me slip it in, and let me take you down
Damn, girl, understand, girl
Your panties look better on the floor
So me a favour, misbehaviour
Let 'em go, let 'em go
Leave your panties on the dresser
Muchacha...
Bad girl, now lift your dress up
Sexy-ass girl, and I'm your professor

[Bridge - Craig Robinson:]
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...
Take 'em off...
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...
Take 'em off...
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...
Take 'em off...
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...
Take 'em off...

[Outro - Snoop Dogg:]
What is a king without a queen?
What is the ding, without the ding-a-ling?
It all matters, it's one thing
With you pulling those panties down
So, no time to waste - this is the place
You're forced to so something you've always wanted to
So take 'em off...
