Knives and silly clubs,
Hos and fake thugs,
Pimps, players, and all of the above.

Thumbin thru scriptures,

Wenches miss us and they wanna french kiss us,
Pack the pistas,

Roll with me on this Dogg adventure,
But you cant enta,
Without ya credentias,
And if ya get in, you might get a picture,
So shit ya shit down, go and get down,
Cuz Huggy Bear is comin to yo town.

So make ya wish list,
And go and flicc this. (Preach!)
