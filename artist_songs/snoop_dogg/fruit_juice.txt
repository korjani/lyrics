This when you hear

[Hook:]
Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues

[Bridge:]
High level natural vibes what we give in
My princess say she love it when we write pandy rhythm
Natural berry also very good for the system
Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them

[Verse 1:]
Sweet sap, knees berry, cantaloupe, soup sop
Pineapple, mango my taste buds tangle
An ice cold beverage in my hunny come hideout
Chillin with my beautiful empress we are stand out

[Bridge:]
High level natural vibes what we give in
My princess say she love it when we write pandy rhythm
Natural berry also very good for the system
Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them

[Hook:]
Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues

[Verse 2:]
She sip the beef juice, she really love the medicine
Twink it down slow feel it good vibe settling
The weaker flavours going down
She ordered up another round
Tell me that she feel alright
Walk to Jesus never spy
Feel me grab the juice
She ever held the upper tide
No drink the red bull,
Because she don't believe the hype

[Hook:]
Fruit juice
