The smoothest of the smoothest and locest of the locest
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together
So kindly, and you can find on the coast with the most lambs
High post, plain coast with a bunch thug niggas, drug dealers
Project fools, C-Murder past dem tools
Shit I'm bout to make these motherfuckers get up
I draw the line between yours and mine
And make sure you dont get lit up
Hit ha on the motha fickin set when dip
Dogg pound mutha Fuckin gangsta crew
Split wigs for a livin everydays thanksgiving
Mutha fuck yall rides, we slides we dippin
Nigga the tanks, driven by the colonel Mr. Master P
Lil Silkky, Mystikal, C and me and Fiend
Nigga dont be trippin, you got my lil homie in the cut
That Soulja Slim nigga , he known for dippin

And the rap game is just like the dope game
The minute you forget it, forget it you finished
Them niggas know when you aint with it
Thats when they get ignent 

(Don't let go)
Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with this

Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
