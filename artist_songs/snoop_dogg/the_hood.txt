Everything I do is for the hood
I'll probably never leave from my hood, my hood
Get a lot of love in the hood, the hood
That's why I represent for my hood, my hood

No matter how much money that I got
My home sweet home's right here on the block
B side counting all this gwap, this is all a nigga got
Watching for them haters and them fakers and them traders
Catch me on the other side, with all the money makers
Shout out to my home girl, hustling like it's niggas too
Shooting dice and pimping few, doing what them bitches do
Surviving, tying the knot, keep my chucks laced
East side since I trip and fall, fieets I'm stumble on a pay
See I'm hood rich with a hood bitch, you know all that hood shit
Pull up and I pull fast, bagging up on your ass quick
Worldwide, hood at your confrontation
Niggas blasting motivation, niggas flashing
Get money, yeah that's what happening

I'm proud of the pills, purp, paper, the pussy poppin
Bitches in short skirts keeping the clock pocking
Life on the block, drop top from old schools
Fights in the club, niggas must remain loose
Everything I do is for the hood (is for the hood)
I'll probably never leave from my hood (it's for the hood)
Get a lot of love in the hood (worldwide)
That's why I represent for my hood, hood

You know I climbed from the bottom, yeah I made it out the hood
Got them goons popping at you, just to make it understood
You can't claim cob without being up in the streets
Grow up in the trenches yea maneuver all throughout the streets
At a certain time at night, clutching on that heat
For them gangster pimps and busters ass, niggas on the street
In the hood it's only good just for them I'm upon the block
We cannot ever leave this spot, because we served in rock
I'mma go see the stripper, see who the big tipper
Fuck the vip, I'm in the front with my niggas
Make it rain on some bitches, yeah we parking lot pixie
Couple niggas I ain't trippin, that's the life that I'm living, cause I'm
