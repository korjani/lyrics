[Verse 1:]
I'm tired in the morning, too late at night
See mama scraping for nickles and dimes
On the salary she's making we can barely survive
Tell me is these something greater in this life?

[Bridge:]
Wait, said mama
Patience, said mama
Breaking down is not an option
Make it happen somehow

How much more can my mama take?
Now I've got to step up to the play
Can't afford to make mistakes
Ain't no time to waste

[Verse 3:]
To hold in since, damn I make it so hard
From California straight to New York
From Chicago going straight to her yard
People everywhere, them everywhere, can I stry?

Everywhere I go them facing much harder times
They know the grass feel greener pon the other side
But me still want see one we can't find
