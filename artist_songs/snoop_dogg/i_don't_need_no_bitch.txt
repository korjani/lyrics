[Verse 1 – Snoop Dogg]
My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigger take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigger all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfucking rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on his dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that

[Chorus]
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….

[Verse 2 - Devin the Dude]
We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
F-ck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them
No, I don’t wine and dine them (bitches)

[Chorus]
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….

[Verse 3 – Snoop Dogg]
Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
I don’t need no bitch bitch bitch
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that

[Chorus]
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….

You need to quit talking crazy
I don’t need no bitch
You need to quit talking crazy
