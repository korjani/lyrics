[Verse 1]
Fist like Tekken
Jump kick wood tips on you in a second
Ready for the battle
You can pick the weapons
Got this combo
Here comes the blastin
Smash on you Pronto
From all directions
Lined to fade up
Buttons get to pressing
Get you with the fisticuffs
Homie you my next win
Get you powered up and come back for revenge
When I start checking chin
You won’t last a couple of seconds
Busters gone in a wind
And Doggy does it again
Step in y’all
Rapping Dogg
Tip toe
Reckon this is teeken

[Chorus]
I Fade Em
Running

[Verse 2]
Put down the sticks
Survival of the fitt‘
You bout to get smashed on
Probably get flipped
Probably get kicked
So you probably gonna lose
So you probably bout to quit
Alright then Dogg
Almost kicked your braids off 
Shaker #1 and I still remain boss
2 one 1, homie
First round Dre picked
Get your jaw broke
Get laid down quick
We gotta have hands in this fight and turn Em in
Put it on quick, pressed start to go!
Get punched in a lip
When I keep playing then a loosa get tipped
(Hahaha)
Set him on his pocket
See I ain’t here to quit
(Fade Em)
Who wanna go?

[Chorus]
Running
I fade Em
I need that

Running
I knock Em down
Running homie
I knock Em down

I knock Em down (down, down)
I need that (I need that)
I knock Em down (I knock Em down)
Running homie
I knock Em (I knock Em down)
I knock Em down down down
