What needs must be 
I realised 
I'm walking out 
From blackened skies

You say belief
Is in our eyes 
But how can I believe 
In blind lies

I'm counting 
On your heavy heart 
Could it keep me 
From falling apart

Have we been born to follow
Tied to a bitter rein
Or will we begin to grow
Bound by this simple chain

Will we evolve tonight
Sparkle like brittle stars
Can we dissolve tonight
Held by your hungry arms

I'm counting 
On your heavy heart 
Could it keep me 
From falling apart

I would be ready
Ready to go 
Was your heart heavy 
Heavy with sorrow 
Had you been heavy 
We could have both been grown
Now your hearts heavy 
Heavy with sorrow 

I'm counting 
On your heavy heart 
Could it keep me 
From falling apart

What needs have been 
You'll realize 
I've found myself 
In bluer skies

I know belief 
Is in your eyes 
We can't believe
In blind light 

I'm counting 
On your heavy heart
To keep me
From falling apart
