We sat all night around a table
Trying to string three words together
Time has come and
By the way, mine's a double
By the way, mine's a double

Nothing for some
We don't understand
Everything we hear
We just pick out the simple stuff
Simple stuff
We don't need all those complications
We're tough stuff
And we got no intentions

[Repeat]
