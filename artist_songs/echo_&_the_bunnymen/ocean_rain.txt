All at sea again 
And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain 
To bathe me again 
My ship's a sail 
Can you hear its tender frame 
Screaming from beneath the waves 
Screaming from beneath the waves 

All hands on deck at dawn 
Sailing to sadder shores 
Your port in my heavy storms 
Harbours the blackest thoughts 

I'm at sea again 
And now your hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain 
To bathe me again 
My ship's a sail 
Can you hear its tender frame 
Screaming from beneath the waves 
Screaming from beneath the waves... 

All hands on deck at dawn 
Sailing to sadder shores 
Your port in my heavy storms 
Harbours the blackest thoughts 

All hands on deck at dawn 
Sailing to sadder shores 
Your port in my heavy storms 
Harbours the blackest thoughts 

All at sea again 
And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain 
To bathe me again 
My ship's a sail 
Hear its tender frame 
Screaming from beneath the waves 
Screaming from beneath your waves 
Screaming from beneath the waves 
Screaming from beneath the waves 

All hands on deck at dawn 
Sailing to sadder shores 
Your port in my heavy storms 
Harbours the blackest thoughts
