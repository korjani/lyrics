Hey now love,
I'm right in the middle of
A hurricane that's blowing my way
God's above us 
And all he's really thinking of is
How much pain we've gotta pay

Why do you do it
'Cause it does for you
Why do I do it
'Cause it does me too
Don't mind if I do
No, I don't mind if I do
Yeah, yeah

Hey now love,
Why are you so scared of
The light that breaks the darkest days
I've done stuff
And things you've never heard of
Souls lost along the way

Why do you do it
'Cause it does for you
Why do I do it
'Cause it does me too
Don't mind if I do
No, I don't mind if I do
Yeah, yeah

Hey now love,
What are you made of
From the clay unto the dust
It isn't love
That you're afraid of
It's losing faith in all you trust

Why do you do it
'Cause it does for you
Why do I do it
'Cause it does me too
Why do you do it
'Cause it does for you
Why do I do it
'Cause it does me too
Don't mind if I do
No, I don't mind if I do
Yeah, yeah
