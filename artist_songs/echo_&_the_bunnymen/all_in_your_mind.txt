You say your proud to be 
One of the people 
Hands on the money 
And your feet on the ground 
Shouting out loud 
From the top of the steeple 
Counting the flock while 
Collecting their pounds 
All you thieving wheeler dealers 
In the healing zone 
Giving me fever fever fever fever 
Down to my bones 

I pray 
And nothing happens 
Jesus 
It's all in my mind 
You say 
Stop looking for answers 
And reasons 
They're all in your mind 
All in you mind 

Covered in flies 
And smothered in lava 
I can't scratch my itches 
With these pumice stone hands 
I dream of my days 
As a desert farmer 
Living my life 
On the fat of the sand 
All you thieving wheeler dealers 
In the healing zone 
Giving me fever fever fever fever 
Down to my bones 

I pray 
And nothing happens 
Jesus 
It's all in my mind 
You say 
Stop looking for answers 
And reasons 
They're all in your mind 
All in your mind 

Stuck in a world 
Losing its way and wonder 
I wonder what happened 
To the world we knew 
Splitting the atom 
And feeling its thunder 
Could never ever make me 
Feel the way you do 
You give me fever fever fever fever 
Down to my bones 
Fever fever fever fever 
In the healing zone 

I pray 
And nothing happens 
Jesus 
It's all in my mind 
You say 
Stop looking for answers 
And reasons 
They're all in your mind 
All in your mind
