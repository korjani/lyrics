John Webster was 
One of the best there was 
He was the author of 
Two major tragedies 
The White Devil and 
The Duchess of Malfi 
The White Devil and 
The Duchess of Malfi 

Change in the nether 
Do I get the choice 
Chance in forever 
When do we get the spoils 

Now that love is upside-down 
It's down to us to say that 
Our monkey brains 
Content to laugh 
When laughing wanes 
It's time to change 

Make on the when 
I will be then 
You on the then 
We will be then 

Here it comes again 
Knocking on its feet 
Here it comes again 
Knocking on its feet 

Don't say it's life on the barrier 
Don't say it's life on the barrier 
Don't say it's life on the barrier 

Is it enough now 
To tell me you matter 
When you haven't a clue how 
To bring me to tears 
How many leaves must you crumble 
Till you believe what I told you 
That's a stumble 

Change in the nether 
Do I get the choice 
Chance it forever 
When do we get the spoils
