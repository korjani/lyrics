Am I the half of half-and-half 
Or am I the half that's whole? 
I've got to be one with all my halves 
It's my worthy earthly goal 
It's my worthy earthly goal 
It's my worthy earthly goal 

Are you the heavy half 
Of the lighter me
Are you the ready part 
Of the lighter me

When I came apart 
I wasn't made of sand 
When you fell apart 
Clay crumbled in my hands 
Long way a life load 
Statues and haloes 

Am I the half of half-and-half 
Or am I the half that's whole 
Am I the half that's whole 
Am I the half that's whole 

Are you the wrongful half 
Of the rightful me 
Are you the mongol half 
Of the cerebral me 

When I came apart 
I wasn't made of sand 
When you fell apart 
Clay crumbled in my hands 
When I came apart 
I wasn't made of sand 
When you fell apart 
Clay crumbled in my hands 

If we exercise just some control 
When we exercise our sum control 

Oh isn't it nice 
When your heart is made out of ice 
Oh isn't it nice 
When your heart is made out of ice 

Are you the heavy half 
Of the lighter me 
Are you the ready part 
that has entered me 

Am I the "shall" in po-ten-tial 
Or am I the "suck" in "cess" 
Pools of delusion 
Deluge me 
Am I the more or less 
Am I the more or less 
Am I the more or less 

When I came apart 
I wasn't made of sand 
When you fell apart 
Clay crumbled in my hands 
When I came apart 
I wasn't made of sand 

When I was the Cain 
You were the Abel 
When I came apart 
Clay crumbled in my hands
