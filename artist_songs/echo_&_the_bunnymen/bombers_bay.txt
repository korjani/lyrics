The word went round 
In no dream town 
They shut us up 
And the shutters down 
The planes flew in 
And laid the ground 
We built upon 
And spun around 
God's one miracle 
Lost in circles 

On the march 
Berlin to Bombers Bay 
Traveling dark 
On the roads to Mandalay 

Cannon fire 
Came to call 
Stood us up 
And watched us fall 
The way we were 
And now outworn 
Our costumes changed 
To uniforms 
Black black days 
Here to stay 

On the march 
Madrid to Bombers Bay 
Traveling dark 
On the road to Mandalay 

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Smile boys that's the style 
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Smile 

They give us hope 
And teach us well 
With magic moons 
That cast a spell 
And hypnotize 
And draw us in 
I believe 
I'm believing 
God's one miracle 
Moves in circles 

On the march 
Berlin to Bombers Bay 
Traveling dark 
On the road 

On the march 
Berlin to Bombers Bay 
Traveling dark 
On the road to Mandalay 

Black black days 
Where the flying fishes play 
Black black days 
Where the flying fishes play 
Black black days 
Where the flying fishes play 
Black black days 
Where the flying fishes play...
