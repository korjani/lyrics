She floats like a swan 
Grace on the water 
Lips like sugar 
Lips like sugar 
Just when you think you've caught her 
She glides across the water 
She calls for you tonight 
To share this moonlight 

You'll flow down her river 
She'll ask and you'll give her 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 

She knows what she knows 
I know what she's thinking 
Sugar kisses 
Sugar kisses 
Just when you think she's yours 
She's flown to other shores 
To laugh at how you break 
And melt into this lake 

You'll flow down her river 
But you'll never give her 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 

She'll be my mirror 
Reflect what I am 
A loser and a winner 
The King of Siam 
And my Siamese twin 
Alone on the river 
Mirror kisses 
Mirror kisses 

Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 

Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 

Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses 
Lips like sugar 
Sugar kisses
