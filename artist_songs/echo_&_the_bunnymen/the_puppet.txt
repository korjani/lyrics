I'll practice my fall 
For practice makes perfect 
Chained to the wall 
For maximum hold 
The window's too far 
Too far from my legs 
Open the door and let out the cold 

You knew about this 
With your head in your hands 
All along 
I was the puppet 
I was the puppet

Trampolines broken 
Ceiling has come down 
The ache in my back tells me 
Something's gone wrong 
Rocking horse rocks 
As the wallpaper peels 
Curtain would like to know 
What he has done 

You knew about this 
With your head in your hands 
All along 
I was the puppet 
I was the puppet

We're the salt of the earth 
(I'll practice my fall for practice makes perfect) 
And we know what to say
(Chained to the wall for maximum hold) 
We're the salt of the earth
(The window's too far too far from my legs) 
And we know our place
(Open the door and let out the cold) 

You knew about this
With your head in your hands
All along
I was the puppet 
I was the puppet 

All along 
(You knew about this) 
With your head in your hands 
All along 
(You knew about this) 
I was the puppet 
I was the puppet 

(You knew about this) 
Head in your hands 
(You knew about this) 
I was the puppet 
I was the puppet 
(We're the salt of the earth) 
You knew about this 
(We know what to say) 
Your head in your hands 
(We're the salt of the earth) 
All along 
((You knew about this))
(We know our place) 
I was the puppet 
(We're the salt of the earth) 
All along 
(We know what to say) 
((You knew about this)) 
Your head in your hands 
(We're the salt of the earth) 
I was the puppet 
((You knew about this)) 
(We know what to say) 
I was the puppet
