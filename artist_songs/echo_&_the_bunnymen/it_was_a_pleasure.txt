Let's get through this shit
I know you'd like that too
The stuff that undermines 
The best of me and you

It was a pleasure to meet you
You slapped me right on the back
Just a pleasure to meet you
You got it almost exact
Make no discussion now
Make no bad dreams now
Make no reason now 
Make no excuses now

If I knock it all back 
Just like you say I do
Would it confirm the suspect 
That suspicion will do?

It was a pleasure to meet you
You slapped me right on the back
Just a pleasure to meet you
You got it almost exact
Make no discussion now
(No discussion)
Make no illusion now
(No illusion)
Make no dilusion now
(No dilusions)
Make no excuses now
(No excuses)

All hands on deck
All              


Make no discussion now
(No discussion)
Make no illusion now
(No illusion)
Make no dilusion now
(No dilusions)
Make no excuses now
(No excuses)

Let's get rid of this shit
I know you'd like that too
The stuff that undermines 
The best of me and you
Failure to do so will result in the failure
Failure to do so will result in the failure
