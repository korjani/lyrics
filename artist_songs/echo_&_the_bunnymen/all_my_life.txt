Oh how the times have changed us 
Sure and now uncertain 
Men not devils have claimed us 
Purity deserting 
God's one miracle 
Lost in circles 

All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 

Cannon fire burning 
On the hillside 
You and I are side by side 
Listen 
Tin soldiers playing our tune 

All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round and round 

Songs for life's lost lovers 
Bitter sweet their healing 
Their prayers prayed under covers 
Need not kneeling 
God's one miracle 
Moves in circles 

All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 

All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 
And round 
And round
