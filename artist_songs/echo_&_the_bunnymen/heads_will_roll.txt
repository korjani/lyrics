Partly politic 
Heads will roll 
Mostly politic 
God must call 
Till the winning hand does belong to me 

What if no one's calling 
God then must be falling 

If I ever met you 
In a private place 
I would stare you 
You into the ground 
That's how I'd articulate 
The value of my face 
The value on my face 

What if no one's calling 
God then must be falling 
What if no one's calling 
God then must be falling 
What if no one's calling 
God then must be falling 
What if no one's calling 
God then must be falling
