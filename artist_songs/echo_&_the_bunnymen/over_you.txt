Jump right in
Take the call 
Were you pushed 
Or did you fall?
Fell apart 
Feeling low 
Happy ride 
The merry-go 

And I always hear them singing 
And complaining about the world 
But my chiming bells are ringing out 
The word the word the word 

Love rebounds 
Heart goes snap 
Is she ever 
Coming back?
Let her down 
Break her fall 
Never ever 
Felt so small 

And I always hear them singing 
And complaining about the world 
And my chiming bells are ringing out 
The word the word the word 

Feeling good again 
Always hoped I would 
Never believed 
That I ever could 
Feeling blue again 
Never wanted to 
Under the weather 
And it's over you 

Over you (the hole in the holy)
(And the crack in our hearts)
Over you (it's love and love only)
(That sets our world apart)
Over you (worlds apart)
(Joined at the heart)
