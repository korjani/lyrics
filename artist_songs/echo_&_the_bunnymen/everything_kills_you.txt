And when it comes
Always too late
You put the future behind you

Then when it's gone
Always too soon
You put the past in front of you, in front of you

Everything takes you
Everything aches you
Everything breaks you
Everything spills you
Everything ills you
Everything kills you

And when the world
Is never enough
Nothing at all is too much for you

And when what's real
Is always too tough
Nothing at all can touch you, touch you

Everything takes you
Everything fakes you
Everything breaks you
Everything wills you
Everything chills you
Everything kill's you

And when your heart's in pieces
And when your heart's in pieces
It's when the world's in pieces now
the world's in pieces now
the world's in pieces now

And when it comes
Always too late
You've got the future behind you

Then when it's gone
Always too soon
You've put the past in front of you, in front of you

Everything takes you
Everything aches you
Everything breaks you
Everything spills you
Everything ills you
Everything kills you
Everything takes you
Everything makes you
Everything fakes you
Everything wills you
Everything chills you
Everything kills you

Everything kills you

Everyone kills you

Everything kills you
