In an ice-capped fire 
Of burning wood 
In our world of wire 
Ignite our dreams of starry skies 
And you and me 
As realised our bigger themes 

Oh, take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 
Take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 

Do or die 
What's done is done 
True beauty lies 
On the blue horizon 

Who or why 
What's one is one 
In pure disguise 
Of vulgar sons 

Oh, take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 
Take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 

Whatever burns burns eternally 
So take me in turns internally 
When I'm on fire 
My body will be 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 

In an ice-capped fire 
Of burning wood 
In our world of wire 
Ignite our dreams of starry skies 
And you and me 
As realised our bigger themes 

Oh, take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 
Take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me
