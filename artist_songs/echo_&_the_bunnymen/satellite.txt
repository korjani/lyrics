Moonlight Starlight 
Insight Out of sight 
Something's certain 
draw the curtains draw them 

Take the night 
When it calls 
Take the night 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 

You will I might 
Talking satellites 
Rockets comets 
Something's coming 

Take the night 
When it calls 
Take the night 
When it falls 
When it falls 
Take the night 
When it falls 

Out out All out 
In doubt Far out 
Wheels in motion 
Take it take it take it the potion 

Take the night 
When it calls 
Take the night 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 

Moonlight 
Starlight 
Insight 
Out of sight 

Take the night 
When it calls 
Take the night 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 
When it falls 

When the night falls 
It falls 
It falls 
It falls 
It falls 
It falls
