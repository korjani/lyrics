My life picks
My hands clean
No head shaved
It's quite safe
Compromise discovery
It's just and it's only

I took the pill
All you missed
Constued all
The tactics

You must learn
To dintinguish error from your fate
They don't think it's funny
That he's beginning to accept the facts

To the middle of the floor
You walked over
In the middle of the wall
The picture still hanging
From the corner of my eye
You stick pins in
In the middle of the floor
I fell over

We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to sing about
We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to shout about
We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to sing about

No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
