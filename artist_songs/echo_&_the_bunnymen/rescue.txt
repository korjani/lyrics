If I said I'd lost my way
Would you sympathise
Could you sympathise?
I'm jumbled up
Maybe I'm losing my touch
I'm jumbled up
Maybe I'm losing my touch
But you know I didn't have it anyway

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my rescue

Things are wrong
Things are going wrong
Can you tell that in a song
I don't know what I want anymore
First I want a kiss and then I want it all

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my rescue
Rescue, rescue, rescue

Things are wrong
Things are going wrong
Can you tell that in a song
Losing sense of those harder things
Is this the blues I'm singing?
Is this the blues I'm singing?
Is this the blues I'm singing?
Is this the blues I'm singing?

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my rescue
Is this the blues I'm singing
Won't you come on down to my rescue

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the blues I'm singing?)
Won't you come on down to my
(Rescue)
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the blues I'm singing?)
(Rescue)
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the blues I'm singing?)
(Rescue)
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the blues I'm singing?)
(Rescue)
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the, I'm singing)
Won't you come on down to my
(Is this the, I'm singing)
