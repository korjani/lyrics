No hands on the wheel
Nothing can touch you
When you can't even feel
No one you can trust
Cos no one's for real
No one's for real

Father forget us
Or father forgive us
Giving us faith
And then calling us sinners
Mixing up the losers
With all of the winners
Tonight… yeah yeah yeah

Kneeling at the crossroads
All my bridges burning
Down the river my life flows
Took another wrong turning

Knows what she feels
But he's never felt her
Wanted a home
But he needed shelter
Never gonna win
With the hand he dealt her
Aces low… tonight
Yeah yeah yeah

Kneeling at the crossroads
All my bridges burning
Down the river my life flows
Took another wrong turning

I will find you… 
I know you only want to share my pain
But I've got something weird
Pumping through my veins
Got the type of blood
That can't be changed…
Can't be changed
Kneeling at the crossroads
All my bridges burning
Down the river my life flows
Took another wrong turning
