Here am I 
Whole at last with a golden view 
Looking for hope 
And I hope it's you 
Splitting my heart 
Cracked right in two 
The pleasure of pain endured 
To purify our misfit ways 
And magnify our crystal days 

Where are you 
In shadows only I can see 
Looking for hope 
And you hope it's me 
Tattered and torn and born to be 
Building a world where we can 
Purify our misfit ways 
And magnify our crystal days 

Pure and to magnify 

Here am I 
Whole at last with a golden view 
Looking for hope 
And I know it's you 
Splitting my heart 
Cracked right in two 
The pleasure of pain and joy 
To purify our misfit ways 
And magnify our crystal days 

Purify our misfit ways 
And magnify our crystal days 

Do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do 

Days
