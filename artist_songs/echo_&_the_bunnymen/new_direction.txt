Out on a limb 
Did you see what the cat dragged in 
Take it on the chin 
Catching fire on a roof of tin 

You've learnt to speak and you're professing 
The right to teach us our direction 
But I found out on close inspection 
True imperfection 

I'm looking for a new direction 
Where in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection 
Then you took me out to climb 

Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Kissing the spires 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Souls on fire 

Inside of my head 
I heard what the good Lord said 
"Beware" he said 
If you don't you might end up dead 

You suck the air right out of me 
But though you suck you cannot see 
That life and living is not free 
Though you live you do not breathe 

I'm looking for a new direction 
Where in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection 
And then you took me out to climb 

Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Kissing the spires 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Souls on fire 

I have changed 
But still my heart 
Remains intact 
And true love stays 
But will our hearts 
Retain their lack of 

No sense and no direction 
Who in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection 
And then you took me out to climb 

Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Kissing the spires 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher 
Souls on fire 

Start confessing 
Start confessing 

All my evils would be blessed 
If to God I did confess 
Wipe the slate and see if I 
Ate the bread and drank the wine 
So as you're leaving I take possession 
Just take the bottle and start confessing
