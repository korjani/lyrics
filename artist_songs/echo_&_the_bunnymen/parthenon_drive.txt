There I am
Must have been just five
Five parts alive
On Parthenon Drive

Pencils and pen-knives
On Parthenon Drive

Years turned
Into an eight
And you made me wait
At the garden gate
And you were always late
When I was eight

Clocks hit twelve
And dreams will fall
Off my shelves
And off my walls

Turned into
A twenty two
And airplanes flew
When I was twenty two
And growing pains grew
When I was twenty two

Spinning round a thirty three
Trying to find
The worth in me
Yeah trying to find
Gave all the earth to be

Clocks hit twelve
And dreams will fall
Off my shelves
And off my walls

Revolving round
A forty five
Glad to be alive
Around a forty five
Yeh glad to be alive
Around a forty five

Here I am
The age of five
Five parts alive
On Parthenon Drive
Glad to be alive
From Parthenon Drive
