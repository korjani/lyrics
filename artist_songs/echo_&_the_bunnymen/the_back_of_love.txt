I'm on the chopping block 
Chopping off my stopping thought 
Self doubt and selfism 
Were the cheapest things I ever bought 
When you say it's love 
D'you mean the back of love 
When you say it's love 
D'you mean the back of love? 

We're taking advantage of 
Breaking the back of love 
We're taking advantage of 
Breaking the back of love 

Easier said than done you said 
But it's more difficult to say 
With eyes bigger than our bellies 
We want to but we can't look away 
What were you thinking of 
When you dreamt that up? 
What were you thinking of 
When you dreamt that up? 

Taking advantage of 
Breaking the back of love 

When you're surrounded by a simple chain of events 
(Behind my eyes, behind my eyes)
(Your eyes don't lie)
Eventually you'll shack those shackles off 
(Dreams above those eyes)
(Those eyes)

We can't tell our left from right 
But we know we love extremes 
Getting to grips with the ups and downs 
Because there's nothing in between 
When you say that's love 
D'you mean the back of love 
When you say that's love 
D'you mean the back of love? 

Taking advantage of 
Breaking the back of love 

What were you thinking of 
When you dreamt that up? 

We're taking advantage of 
We're breaking the back of love 
Breaking the back of love
