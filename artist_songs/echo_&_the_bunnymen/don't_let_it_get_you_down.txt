You're really something else 
Made me forget myself 
My lights came on 
When I got to you 
You were almost through 
You're almost gone 

Don't let it get you down 
Don't let it get you down 
The moon and the stars goes crashing round 
Don't let it get you down 

An angel walked amongst us 
Tried but couldn't love us
Somethings wrong 
Since you've gone you know 
There's nothing and no one
To hang love on 

So tell me how it feels 
Tell me how it feels 
To touch the flame 
Tell me who I am 
Tell me who I really am 
What's my name 

Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 

Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 

Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 
(When you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round 
(When you're alone)
Don't let it get you down 

God's above us and Jesus loves us 
If God's above us and Jesus loves us 
If God's above us 
(If you want it, you can get it)
And Jesus loves us 
(If you want it, you can get it)
If God's above us 
(If you want it, come on get it)
And Jesus loves us 
(Right now)
If God's above us 
(If you want it, you can get it)
And Jesus loves us 
(If you want it, you can get it)
If God's above us 
(If you want it, come on get it)
And Jesus loves us
