Can you hear it?
The sound of something burning
Something changing
On the merry-go-round tonight

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Love it all

Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right tonight

People come
I count every one
Faces burning, hearts beating
Nowhere left for us to run

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Love it all

Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right tonight

Can you hear it
The sound of someone thinking
Someone thinking
On the merry-go-round tonight

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Love it all
