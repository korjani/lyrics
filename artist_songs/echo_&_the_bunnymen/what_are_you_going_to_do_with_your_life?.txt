If I knew now what I knew then
I'd wonder how not wonder when
There's something going wrong again
With me and mine 
It's only ever what it seems
Memories and might have beens 
Heaven's scent: the smell of dreams 
We'll never find
Tell me... tell me... tell me... 

What are you going to do with your life? 
What are you going to do with your life? 
What are you going to do? 
What are you going to be? 
What am I going to do? 
I'm going to be me be me be me

If I could see what you can see
The sun still shining out of me
I'd be the boy I used to be
When love was blind
I'd let the light back in again
And walk you to the tunnel's end
I'll be yours and maybe then
You'll be mine
Tell me... tell me... tell me... 

I will if you will... follow me down
