How can you pretend 
When there's so much at stake
That it's a different world 
And your hands don't shake

At the end of the room
And the foot of the bar
We knew that soon 
We'd be making our mark

Why do you defend 
The part you have to take
With your fingers on the world 
Hoping your hands don't shake

When you get the time 
Why not think about
Connecting yours and mine 
And turning in to out

Back to the bar
I was feeling it
The hole in the floor 
Was where I would sit

Positions will be lost 
And things will fall in place
The falling will not stop 
Till we have found our face

Oh will you mention
Oh will you mention 
My name to one
Oh will you mention 
My name to me

Gods will be gods 
But my lord forgot 
I was made out of skin
Bones will be bones 
But when I came home 
There was no one in

So where were you staying 
While I was out playing
Was nobody laying the foundation,
The fulfilling of our killing

How can you pretend 
That there's so much at stake
And it's a different world 
And everything shakes

I am the unknown               
You're the after taste
I am total love
I am total hate

Let's face facts
We won't mind
of us
We will...
