Where the hell have you been
We've been waiting with our best suits on
Hair slicked back and all that jazz
Rolling down the Union Jack
See you at the barricades babe
See you when the lights go low, Joe
Hear you when the wheels turn round
Someday when the sky turns black

It appears because it's what I feel
I know I don't understand
If you ask you know I don't mind kneeling
But when my knees hurt I like to stand
Instinct is the common lawyer
A million years won't erase
Strike the chord I'm searching for
Call it a committed race

No matter how I shake my fist
I know I can't resist it
No matter how you shake your fist
You know you can't resist it
See you at the barricades babe
See you when the lights go low, Joe
Hear you when the wheels turn round
Someday when the sky turns black
