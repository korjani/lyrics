I slept by the mountain
Of rivers we crossed
I dreamt of the fountain
And the coin that we tossed

Now I'm just counting
The dreams that were lost
One coin in a fountain
Was all that it cost
Is that all it cost?

I followed the oceans
I swallowed the seas
I buried emotions
I couldn't set free

I took every potion
From A to me
And that was devotion
Was that really me?
Is that really me?

What a way to waste your wishes
Changing something for somehow
What I'd pay to taste your kisses
oh yeah
Here and now, here and now,
here and now, D'you hear me now

Will there be thunder?
Will lightning strike?
Will I kneel in wonder
In a tunnel of light?

Or will I go under?
And give up the fight
When they call my number
Called in the night
Call in the night

I cried the fountain dry
I climbed the mountains high
Hallelujah... hallelujah...

Hallelujah... hallelujah... hallelujah...
Hallelujah... hallelujah... hallelujah...

I got to you... hallelujah... hallelujah...
I got to you... hallelujah... hallelujah...
