You set my teeth on edge
You set my teeth on edge 
You think you're a vegetable
Never come out of the fridge

C-c-c-cucumber
C-c-c-cabbage
C-c-c-cauliflower
Men on Mars
April showers
Oh oh, oh oh

You are a dying breed
You are a dying breed
You once was an Inca
Now you're a Cherokee

C-c-c-cucumber
C-c-c-cabbage
C-c-c-cauliflower
Men on Mars
April showers

(You kick it, kick it)
(Ow uh, ow uh)
(Ow uh, ow uh, ow uh)

Wait for me on the blue horizon
Blue horizon for everyone
Wait for me on a new horizon
New horizons for everyone

I want to be one times one with you
Oh oh
I want to be one times one with you
Oh oh
Ah ah, ahh
Ah ah, ahh

I've decided to wear my thorn of crowns
I've decided to wear my thorn of crowns
Inside out
Back to front
Upside down
All the way round
Round, round rounnd

I've decided to wear my thorn of crowns
I've decided to wear my thorn of crowns
Upside down
Inside out
Back to front
All the way round, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
