You said something will change
We were all dressed up somewhere to go
No sign of rain
But something will change, you promised

You said nothing will change
We were almost near almost far
Down came the rain
But nothing will change, you promised

A promise
A promise
A promise

It's exactly the same
You said it's always the same
But I'll make it change
Into something the same, I promise

A promise
A promise
A promise

Light on the waves
Light on the waves
Light on the waves
Light on the waves

A promise
A promise
A promise
A promise

Light on the water
(A promise)
We could sail on forever
(A promise)

There's light on the water
We could sail on forever
There's light on the water
(A promise)

There's light on the water
(A promise)
We could sail on forever
(A promise)
