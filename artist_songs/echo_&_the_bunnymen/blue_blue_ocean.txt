One in a million 
One and the same 
Looking for freedom 
Born to be tamed 
Once in a lifetime 
One of these days 
Gonna grab me a lifeline 
Swinging my way 

I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean 
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea 
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping 
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me 
You and me 

Hearts of fire 
Hearts of bone 
Beating stronger 
Beating home 
Where there's wanting 
There is need 
Where there's having 
There is greed 

I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean 
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea 
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping 
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me 
You and me 

Girl 
I want the gold dust 
In your fingers 
And your Klondike touch 
Girl 
I want your goldmine 
As it shimmers 
In your solemn eyes 

I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean 
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea 
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping 
Licking the bones of you and me 
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean 
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea 
Blue blue sea 

I'm swimming out on the ocean 
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea 
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on the ocean 
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea 
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on the ocean 
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea 
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on the ocean 
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea 
(Blue blue sea)
