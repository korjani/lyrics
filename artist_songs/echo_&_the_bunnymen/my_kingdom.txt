I chop and I change and the mystery thickens 
There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen 
To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle 
Born of the grain like all good riddles 

B-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top 
Thy will be done 
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of 
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom 

You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens 
Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking 
If my heart is a war its soldiers are bleeding 
If my heart is a war its soldiers are dead 

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top 
Thy will be done 
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of 
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom 

Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do

I've lost and I've gained and while I was thinking 
You cut off my hands when I wanted to twist 
If you know how to dance to Boney Maroney 
He's doing the ballet on both of his wrists 

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top 
Thy will be done 
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of 
Your k-k- k- k- k- kingdom, king-k- k- k- k- 

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top 
And I will be done 
B-b-bite the nose off and make the most of 
Your king- kingdom, kingdom, kingdom 

(You're a bitter malignous person)
(And the death is well overdue)
(You suck the blood that kills you)
(You kiss the hand that hates you)

(You're a bitter malignous person)
(And your death is well overdue)
(Your sucking bitter pain)
