I'll be with you in your Summer
Winter Spring and Fall days
You and me, yeah we've got each other
I'll be there... always 

Love it when you say
I'm the gold inside your goldmine
And I love the way
You just make me shine

When our ship hits stormy weather
We'll ride the tidal waves
You and me sailing seas together
In the same boat... always

Love it when you say
I'm the gold inside your goldmine
And I love the way
You just make me shine

I'll be with you in your Summer
Winter Spring and Fall days
You and me, yeah we've got each other
I'll be there... always 

Love it when you say
I'm the gold inside your goldmine
And I love the way
You just make me shine
