Realistically
It's hard to dig it all too happily
But I can see
It's not always that real to me
A funny thing
Is always a funny thing
Though sadly things
Just get in the way

Open to suggestion
Falling over questions

Hopefully
But that's as well as maybe
A shaking hand
Won't transmit all fidelity
Your golden smile
Would shame a politician
Typically
I'll apologise next time

Bonds will break and fade
Go snapping all in two
The lies that bind the tie
Come sailing out of you

Realistically, 
Hard to dig it all too happily
But I can see, 
Not always that real to me
A funny thing
Is always a funny thing
And those sadly things
Is always a sadly thing

Bonds will break and fade
A snapping all in two
The lies that bind the tie
Come sailing out of you

A show of strength
Is all you want
You can never set it down...

Guts and passion
Those things you can't
Even set down
All those things you think might count
You can't ever set them down
Don't ever set them down
Never set them down
Hey, I came in right on cue
One is me and one is you...
Hey, I came in right on cue
One is me and one is you...
