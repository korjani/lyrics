You said you couldn't find anyone
To love you
I said there's more to life than a broken heart
Did it console you?

I've seen in your eyes
I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks

You know the words
Please do say it from your knees
Show some respect
Hey baby, genuflect
Once I like crying
Twice I like laughter
Come on tell me what I'm after

I said you've gotta stop chasing rainbows
You said I'm just staying up
And anyway
I like it when the rain goes

I've seen in your eyes
I've read it in books
Who want's love
Without the looks

Once I like crying
Twice I like laughter
Come on tell me what I'm after

There's not that much to us
I hide the little with a lot
You still expect a lovely fuss
After showing all you've got

I've seen in your eyes
I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks
That's all
