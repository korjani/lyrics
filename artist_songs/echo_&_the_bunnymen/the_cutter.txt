Who's on the seventh floor 
Brewing alternatives 
What's in the bottom drawer 
Waiting for things to give 

Spare us the cutter 
Spare us the cutter 
Couldn't cut the mustard 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 

Come to the free for all 
With seven tapered knives 
Some of them six feet tall 
We will escape our lives 

Spare us the cutter 
Spare us the cutter 
Couldn't cut the mustard 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still recoil 
When the skin is lost 
Am I the worthy cross 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 
Ocean 

Watch the fingers close 
When the hands are cold 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still recoil 
When the skin is lost 
Am I the worthy cross 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off
