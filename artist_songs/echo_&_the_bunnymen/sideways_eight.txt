It's us
Counting the ones we love
On the fingers of one glove
Collate
Count all the ones we hate
And side step the sideways eight

Move on, prove and improve on
You'll get your groove on and you'll get there
I'm sorry, baby don't worry
I'm just in a hurry to get somewhere

It's me
Still put an apostrophe
In every catastrophy
And it's you
Still making analogies
While I'm faking apologies

So move on, prove and improve on
You'll get your groove on and you'll get there
Sail on, hail and inhale on
Wagging your tail on
A different air

It's us
Counting the ones we love
On the fingers of one glove

So move on, prove and improve on
You'll get your groove on and you'll get there
Sail on, hail and inhale on
Wagging your tail on
A different air

Move on, prove and improve on
You'll get your groove on and you'll get there
I'm sorry, baby don't worry
I'm just in a hurry to get somewhere

I'm getting somewhere
am I getting somewhere
I'm sorry
