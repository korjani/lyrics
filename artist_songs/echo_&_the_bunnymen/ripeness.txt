I found a thing in a bedroom 
Change the shape of the world 
For long enough 
Got the boat til as far as I could 
Afford it to take me 
It was far enough 

Mature you said at the wrong time 
Broke my aging skin 'cause age was mine 
Had a field day 
Smelt like roses 
Harvesting my thoughts 'cause it was time 

When you grasped the question 
Did you miss the meaning 
When you met your challenge 
Did you go out fighting 
We will discover 
Ripeness twice over 

Sing your song 
Worth its weight 
In god gold 
Curse its fate 

When you grasped the question 
Did you miss the meaning 
When you met your challenge 
Did you go out fighting 
How will we recover 
Ripeness when it's over 

I lost something in a big room 
Change the shape of the world 
For long enough 

When you grasped the question 
Did you miss the meaning 
When you met your challenge 
Did you go out fighting 
When you climbed on top 
Did you fall on shadows 
And then clambering off 
Did you fall on rainbows 

How will we recover 
Ripeness when it's over 
How will we recover 
Ripeness when it's over 

Neither kinder nor the kinder
Are you fuel for the fire
Neither uber nor the over
Must have others to inspire
I've discovered my Nietzche
I've discovered my Nietzche
Death should be unleashed
or something
Do tell me
What's the difference? 
Do tell me 
What's the difference
