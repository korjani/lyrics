I bagsy yours
If you'll bagsy mine
I'll take a chance
If you'll take the blame
Forget it
Forget it

Boys are the same
Brains in their pockets
Girls are the same
Knock it and rock it
Remember
Remember

I'm not a holy man
I'm too lowly for that
I'm not a praying man
I'm not ready for that

Keymon 
Keymon 

I bagsy yours
If you'll bagsy mine
I'll take a chance
If you'll take the blame
Forget it
Forget it
