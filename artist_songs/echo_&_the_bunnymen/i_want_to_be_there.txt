I want to be like you
I want to fly, fly, fly
Want you to take me to
All of your sky

Why don't you kneel me down
Why don't we try, try, try
'Cause when we come around
That's when I fly

'Cause I don't want to go under
It's only just begun
I want to be there when you come
I want to be there when you come

I want to be like you
I want to laugh and cry
About the things we do
Never ask why

'Cause I don't want to go under
It's only just begun

I want to be there when you come
I want to be there when you come

I want to be like you
I want to fly, fly, fly
Want you to take me to
All of your sky

I want to paint the town
And drink it dry, dry, dry
And when the lights go down
I'll say goodbye

Through the rain and the thunder
I'm heading into the sun
I want to be there when you come
I want to be there when you come
(I want to be there)
I want to be there when you come
(I want to be there)
La la la la la la la la
