Something got me thinking tonight about
Changes
Changes

Somebody bought me a ticket tonight
Dangerous
Dangerous

I've just gotta go...
Where everything is what it could be now
Where everything is ready for me now
Everything and every time
Everything and every kind
Make me yours
I'll make you mine
Make us blind.

Someone asked me something tonight,
what my name is, game is

Somebody made me feel something tonight
Brainless, painless

I've just gotta know...
