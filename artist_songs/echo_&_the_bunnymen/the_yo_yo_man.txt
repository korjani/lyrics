Froze to the bone in my igloo home
Counting the days 'til the ice turns green
You know when heaven and hell collide
There are no in-betweens

(I'm the yo-yo man) 
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down) 
Cold is the wind that blows through my headstone
Collecting the bones of my friend tonight
Sowing the seeds in a fruitless land
You know when prayers all hit the ground
There is no higher hand

(I'm the yo-yo man) 
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my headstone
I'm the yo-yo man, always up and down
So take me to the end of your tether

(I'm the yo-yo man)
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down) 
Cold is the wind that blows through my... 

(I'm the yo-yo man) 
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my...
(I'm the yo-yo man)
And the flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through our headstones
