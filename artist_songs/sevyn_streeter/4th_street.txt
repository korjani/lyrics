They say home is where the heart is
My heart's on 4th street
Haines City, Polk County

Woke up this morning, 3 missed calls from my best friend
Ain't want a a thing from me, just calling to check in
Just wanna tell you that you're special
But you know it, yeah you know it
Walk to the corner store with a dollar in my hand
Got everything I needed, God I thank Miss Pam
She said "You're such a diamond girl, keep shining
Anything that you need, I'm here"

Yeah that's my kind of people
The one's that say "hey, hi, what's up, nice to meet you"
The one's that don't need shit, they just wanna see you
Living the life and still treat you like an equal
If you cool then we cool
Yeah that's my kind of people
(4th Street people, 4th Street people)
That's my kind of people
(4th Street people, 4th Street people)
That's my kind of people
We cool, you cool, then we cool
That's my kind of people

Went to a bar to grab a drink the other day
This perfect stranger who didn't even know my name
We talked for hours when I found out
He was homeless and his home was burned down
Gave every dime I had but I knew that it weren't enough
Given the circumstance you would think I'm the lucky one
But he changed my life that day when he said
"You can burn a house but you can't burn a home"

Yeah that's my kind of people
The one's that say "hey, hi, what's up, nice to meet you"
The one's that don't need shit, they just wanna see you
Living the life and still treat you like an equal
If you cool then we cool
Yeah that's my kind of people
(4th Street people, 4th Street people)
That's my kind of people
(4th Street people, 4th Street people)
That's my kind of people
We cool, you cool, then we cool
That's my kind of people

Be the spark that lights the world tonight
Be the light, the light
Be the spark that lights the world tonight
Be the light, the light

Yeah that's my kind of people
My kind of people
The one's that say hi
Just nice to meet you
Don't need other people
They don't want nothing from you
They just wanna love you, love you, love you
Yeah that's my kind of people
