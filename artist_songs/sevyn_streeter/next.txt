[Verse 1:]
Together
Forever, I will never...
Never, let you go!
Seem like soon as we say that,
We at war
Surrender...
Some'n we don't know!

[Hook:]
It's something between us,
Certain fire in our love
It's unreleasable, unbelievable!
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, Oh, all I need to know
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
My ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
I need to know-ow-ow-ooow, ohhh, oh!

[Verse 2:]
Mmm,
Every time we break-up
We turn around and we make up
Momma wonder when I'm gone wake up
But he love my face with no make-up, yeah!
And every time I call'em, we end up having a problem
And I know we probably never solve it, hmmm
But damn, I really love him!

[Hook:]
It's something between us,
Certain fire in our love
It's unreleasable, unbelievable!
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, Oh, all I need to know
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
My ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
I need to know-ow-ow-ooooh, knoooow?

[Verse 3:]
I leave him (leave'em)
Go back to him (back to'em)
Then leave him (leave'em), again! (Ahhhhh)
What we're doing (what we doin'), I wish I knew it (wish I knew it)
I really don't understand
He love me (love me), he love me not (love me not)
What the hell we're doing?
I need to know, I need to know!

[Hook:]
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
My ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
