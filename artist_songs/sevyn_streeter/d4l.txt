[Sevyn Streeter:]
Ay, boy, I don't have all the answers
Except when it comes to us
I hope I'd answer your questions
When you ask who do I love
For you, boy, I'm really lit right beside you
When you in the club tipping
I can be your, be your wife or your mistress
As long as I got you, baby, it ain't no tripping

I'm down for life, D4L, D4L
Me and your girl ain't alike
I'm D4L, D4L
Baby, nothing lasts forever
Unless you're down for whatever (All day)
Down for life, I'm D4L, D4L

I see you playing your odds with some of them girls up in this club
And hollering at my friends trying to get them on your wish list
I know you got that super drive, so I'm a make it happen
Anything for daddy, let me work my magic
Just tell me what you want, baby
And I will bring the promise to life
I'm a bring that life to you now
My girl like what you done did
I'm playing on this level
Are we playin' "Have you ever?"

I'm down for life, D4L, D4L
Me and your girl ain't alike
I'm D4L, D4L
Baby, nothing lasts forever
Unless you're down for whatever (All day)
Down, down for life, I'm D4L, D4L

Ay, boy, I don't have all the answers
Except when it comes to us
I hope I'd answer your questions
When you ask who do I love
For you, boy, I'm really lit right beside you
When you in the club tipping
I can be your, be your wife or your mistress
As long as I got you, baby, it ain't no tripping

I'm down for life, D4L, D4L
Me and your girl ain't alike
I'm D4L, D4L
Baby, nothing lasts forever
Unless you're down for whatever (All day)
Down, down for life, I'm D4L, D4L
