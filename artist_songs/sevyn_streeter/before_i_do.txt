I heard about, you and your other situation
Through word of mouth
They made it seem so complicated
Is it over now?
Or did you just say it 'cause you're anxious?
To get closer now
'Cause I want you to be, all over me

Truthfully (Truthfully)
Honestly (Honestly)
I need, I need, I need to believe
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend
Say it ain't so, you ain't on the low
I don't think I could handle it
I wanna go, to another level, with you

But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
Oh yeah, so tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you

I heard about, heard all about your reputation
You know word gets around
Tell me you got a explanation
'Cause I need to know
Is it nothing?
Is it something?
Ohh, just keep it real with me

Truthfully (Truthfully)
Honestly (Honestly)
I need, I need, I need to believe
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend
Say it ain't so, you ain't on the low
I don't think I could handle it
I wanna go, to another level, with you

But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
Oh yeah, so tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you

It's unfair, cause baby in my mind, ohh
We should be together, whoa
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend
I'm tryna go, to another level, with you

But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
So tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
