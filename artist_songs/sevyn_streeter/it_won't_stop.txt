I love when you pulling up in your Jeep
Bumping all your beats
Js on
With your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing, no, oh

So, I hop up in your ride
Ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Ooh, got the top down
With the doors off
(Ooh) with your hand on my thigh
(Ooh) drive slow
Take your time

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way)
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Everyday, everyday

[x2:]
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh

I love when we pulling up to the beach
Sand down to my feet
Sun down
Nobody 'round
That's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body,
Rock, rock the boat Aaliyah
Don't it sound familiar?

'Cause it feels like ah ah aye aye
Looking up into space
It's just me and my babe
And we feel so amazing
Ooh,
All night
Whoa

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way)
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Everyday, everyday

[x2:]
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat (oh)
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh

Everyday, everyday
I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart
You got the key
Put that on eternity
I love you 'til infinity
Infinity [x4]

My everything [x2]
And when I think about it
Don't be making me wait baby

It won't ever stop
My heart won't skip a beat baby
And it'll keep going on
Going on [x4]

[x2:]
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
Boom, boom oh
