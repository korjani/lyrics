True Shit
It's that true shit
True shit

I should have never offered it
But he made me feel like this could be forever
Never thought he could go run off with it
But it don't make it no better

He used to hit me least four times a day
Till he got what he wanted
Caught me by surprise
I never saw it coming

Wa-wa-wa-wa-walls
Fell, down and up
There goes my pride
Bars, shattered
Now I realize

I should have used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Should have never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame
Why did I let you come in?
I shouldn't have gave my heart away
But I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Havin us lookin foolish
Can't keep letting them do this
(Bitch as niggas)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
(Bitch ass niggas)

And you say it's all in my head
It's all in my head
It's all in my head
So I ignore my intuition
And believe every word that you said

Wa-wa-wa-wa-walls
Fell, down and up
There goes my pride
Bars, shattered
Now I realize

I should have used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Should have never showed you that
Now I got myself to blame
Why did I let you come in?
I shouldn't have gave my heart away
But I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Havin us lookin foolish
Can't keep letting them do this
(Bitch as niggas)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
(Bitch ass niggas)

Niggas be on that bullshit
Actin like they don't do shit
Do shit, do shit
What the fuck? I look stupid
This the way that you made me
And this the way you repay me
Gave you all of me
All of me
Now you sayin I was never your lady

I feel
Like you was just a waist of time for real
(Yeah that's that true shit)
Oh, and I won't ever confuse it, no not ever again

I should have used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Should have never showed you that
Now I got myself to blame
Why did I let you come in?
I shouldn't have gave my heart away
But I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Havin us lookin foolish
Can't keep letting them do this
(Bitch as niggas)
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
(Bitch ass niggas)

Bitch ass niggas
All these bitch ass niggas
True shit
