I am death 
Arms held outstretched 
I am hell 
Born this mortal shell 
I am wrath 
Take this bloodbath 
God sent me to kill you 

What started out as wonder 
The smell of scorched earth 
It filled me with a sense of bliss 
Inside my head the noises show they thundered 
With cracking and hiss 
One match 
Killed the anguish 
One act 
Left me fulfilled 
Destruction now the only catalyst 
To save this soul 
From these thoughtless kills 

Where once a heart was beating 
Nothing but embers glow 
Our love it serves as kindling 
To stoke this flames inferno 

I am hell to thee 
Down here all shall suffer with me 
Die purified 
Rise the ashes to the sky 

Obsession born of young lust 
Incomprehensible the feelings as they come to pass 
But now betrayal slowly turns to bloodlust 
Through sulphur and gas 

Ignite this crime of passion 
Loves pyre is set a blaze 
The charred remains of all 
Compassion was the spark that lit 
Your immolation 

Where once a heart was beating 
Nothing but embers glow 
Our love it serves as kindling 
To stoke this flames inferno 

I am hell to thee 
Down here all shall suffer with me 
Die purified 
Rise the ashes to the sky 

So burn 
I'll burn it down 
I'll burn you down 
So you'll never love again (again) 

Where once a heart was beating 
Nothing but embers glow 
Our love it serves as kindling 
To stoke this flames inferno 

I am hell to thee 
Down here all shall suffer with me 
Die purified 
In this the ashes of your immolation 

I 
AM 
HELL 
In the ashes of your immolation
