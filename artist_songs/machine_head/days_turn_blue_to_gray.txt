Thou have fathered
Son and daughter
Doth begat, yet raised not bother
Paralyzed your children's lives
Wither vines of family ties

Self-destruction
Make him function
Crayons and clay
Days turn blue to gray
Days turn blue to gray

Seventeen when
Family begin
Drinking, fighting, heroin
Unquenchable addictions call
Responsible to none above all

Self-destruction
Make him function
Crayons and clay
Days turn blue to gray
Days turn blue to gray

Lest I taste
Its sweet grapes
Glass to tongue
Across it tips
Cross my lips
Swallow it down

[Solo: Demmel]

Please
Won't you love me?
Please help me see
What did I do?
Did I hurt you?
And now that you're gone
Emptiness lives on
The guilt is all I feel
No closure

Father
Motherfucker
No closure

The strings of my heart
You pulled on endlessly
This twine is severed
In tragedy

Father
Mother Destroyer
Destroy her

Your self-destruction
What made you feel alive
Your self-destruction
Of your children's
Lives
