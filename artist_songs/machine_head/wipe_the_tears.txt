Ask me how it feels
To feel like you're a failure
When everything that's real
Burns the flame in anger
I've heard it all before
I've felt some pain and more
More than you could ever dream
More than it probably seems
I've sat with head in hand
Stressed by my demands
Stomach tied in knots
Alone I've sat and rot
'Cause the pain from all these fears
Has built up all these years
I'll wipe away the tears
Wipe away the tears

Don't give in
Don't give up

Walk the streets dejected
Alone and left rejected
Time does not care
And sometimes life ain't fair
My head begins to pound
Smashing bottles on the ground
I have lived amongst the garbage
With those who rape and carnage
Had many a promise broken
And broken some myself
The promise I have kept alive
Is keep my inner wealth
With my heart aimed at the world
Destiny I watch unfurl
I'll wipe away the tears
Wipe away the tears

Don't give in
Don't give up

Opportunities
Wasting life away
Choked upon its dust
Puked out in disgust

Let me tell you how it feels
To feel like you're a failure
Been climbing out this gutter
For what seems like it's forever
But one thing I must make clear
The struggle of these years
Has made every scar the stronger
My lust for life the longer
I will fight for what I love
And I will fight for those I care
I will fight at anytime
And I will fight anywhere
With my heart aimed at this world
Destiny I watch unfurl
I'll wipe away the tears
Wipe away the tears

Don't give in
Don't give up
