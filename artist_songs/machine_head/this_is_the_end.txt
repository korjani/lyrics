This ends now

This ends now
And I don't care about last year
Won't be afraid of what the future holds can't fear
Want not the past and the safety it brings
It doesn't mean anything
We've come too far
There's no going back now
Bring on the future with an open embrace
Memories I will erase
Memories i will erase

This is the end
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Ever-long is this goodbye and this

This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside

Only now do you pretend to care about this
You suffocated everything that came between us
Took every condescending barb and sting
I don't owe you anything
So here we stand
Farewell is forever
And if you think that its a joke or a lie
Look me in these blackened eyes
Look me in these blackened eyes

This is the end 
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Ever-long is this goodbye and this
This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside

Bastards you bastards
May you suffer oh so long
Bastards you bastards so long

Brothers my brothers
Why have you forsaken thee
Brothers my brothers 
So be

Deny those that will never accept
Empty words are just regrets
Let go the bile that your soul has amassed
With this let die be cast

This is the end
This is the end of chasing dreams gone by
Ever-long is this goodbye and this
This is the end
This is the end of our respect denied
Stand with us or stand aside
