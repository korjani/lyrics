I never ask myself why injustice befell me
Accepted of the fact, try and live a life of peace
I'm not a violent man, but to those who'd threaten me
My enemy, for my family I'll show thee
Death I will fight you to
Wrath provoked you cannot bear
Our lives are not your toys
Mercy, not a drop to spare

You of destruction
Of hope's deconstruction
Kills

Innocence is lost when
The blood of innocents
Spills

I'm not a violent man, again I wish to repeat
But for every human that takes away a child's innocence
Whether it by molest, or by all wars pointlessness
Killer of life
Corruptor of all that is pure
I want your nose to break
Shattered under clenched fist
Smash face to concrete
Taste the asphalt's gentle kiss

You of destruction
Of hope's deconstruction
Kills

Innocence is lost when
The blood of innocents
Spills

[Solo: Demmel]

To those that are to blame
Destroyers of every dream

Breaking of hatred's wings
Mars' phoenix begins fading

To those that monger war
Claiming that this is to even scores

This mantra I invoke
No longer this fear will
I choke

There's no peace for the one who can't know peace
Your every breath it only lives to take
Someday the earth you will descend
Not a regret I'll harbor in
Tearless my eyes
Flowerless my hands

And that day when your moment is fleeting
That thought keeps my heart beating
When they lower your casket down
Bitter the sweet within my mouth
Ender of life
Corruptor of all that's pure

On Your Grave
I Will Stand
