[chorus:]
bow down to no one
bow down to none

straight down
been going
been sleepwalkin'
in a violent haze

this world
in ruin
the chain shackles
like a foul disease

[chorus]

this rage
this struggle
it is a feeling
that's devouring

can't break
can't fuckin' give in
the pain will lead us
through the blistering

cold

[chorus]
