She looked right into my
eyes and said to me
The hurt that you try to
hide is killing me
You drink a thousand lies,
to freeze the past in time

I've tried to fill this
silence up
But now it's back again

See the pain in my eyes
see the scars deep inside
My God, I'm down in this
hole again
With the laughter I smile
with the tears that I cry
Keep going down this road
called life

She says that I'm insecure,
I guess she's right
'Cause just when I think
I'm sure, alone at night
the agonies come back, this
pain won't let me be

I try to fill the silence up
but now it's back again

See the pain in my eyes
see the scars deep inside
My God, I'm down in this
hole again
With the laughter I smile
with the tears that I cry
Keep going down this road
called life
Don't need your sympathy
I just want for this silence
to stop killing me

It's deafening
it's deafening
this silence inside me

I try to fill the silence up
but now it's back again
It's empty like a suicide
this pain inside

See the pain in my eyes
see the scars deep inside
My God, I'm down in this
hole again
With the laughter I smile
with the tears that I cry
Keep going down this road
called life
Don't need your sympathy
I just want for this silence
to stop killing me.
