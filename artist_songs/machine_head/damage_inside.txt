The bell tolls on as the rain comes down
On my face, the drops, they sound
I slowly melt into grey abyss
Depression and her endless kiss
I hope to feel the life again
End the numbness, living in
I sit in silence, deaf to all

And I can't look you in the eye
I don't want you to see the damage inside
I've been gone for so long

My demons pull me into the hole
To dance with leaches that drink my soul
The violins play the endless song
From hearts broken everlong

I can't look you in the eye
I don't want you to see the damage inside
I've been gone for so long

and I can't look you in the eye
I don't want you to see the damage inside
I've been gone for so long
