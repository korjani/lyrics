The taste of avenging blood
Suffer horror she's withstood
Disgust, the core of our soul
The crime takes a new toll
Rapes the soul

Hear her pain
Listen
To what she'd scream

I'm gonna see you bleeding
Face down in the dirt
I'm gonna give you back what
You've taken with hurt
You coward
I'm gonna spit right into your face
In grace you'll be no more

This scar makes her heart stronger
Your breath makes her days longer
Life gained through your dying eyes
Revenge, life's bitter prize
Feel reprise

I'm gonna see you bleeding
Face down in the dirt
I'm gonna give you back what
You've taken with hurt
You coward
I'm gonna spit right into your face
In grace you'll be no more

[Solo: Demmel]

The seasons wither away

And we pray you die
We pray you suffocate
In pain you writhe
This day we celebrate
This day we celebrate
Desecrate

This mind and body
This heart and soul
Will not be trampled
Will not crumble
You can't hurt me
Your power's control denied
And you can't rape me
That moment's effect has died
You're a fucking shell that's dead in my eyes
Dead
DEAD!
