Lie in this state
Of perdition
Never to awake
It negates
An admission
Stricken by fate

There's no salvation it dwells in your bones
There's no remission this sickness it owns
Make love to denial her sober embrace
Nails they've embedded never to release

In madness we shall reign
Down out
In madness we shall reign

Hail Mary our divine
Littered souls across a great divide
In our obsession thou cast pearls before the swine

I numb it down
Heavens fleeting kiss envelops thee
It surrounds
So in vain we stab at the beast

Count the 12 times you step equal 12 times you fail
No abstination relapse tip the scale
As you swallow the hook
And you chew on the line
Choke on the sinker
In this sea of lies

In madness we shall reign

Hail Mary our divine
Littered souls across a great divide
In our obsession thou cast pearls before the swine

Broke vows and broken rosaries
Bind these rusted hopeless dreams
Broke vows and broken rosaries
Bind these rusted hands in prayer
Faith trust and love are mowed down lonely
In these killing fields

Deep in the throes of addiction
Now my blood's running black
My fixation is caught in its clutches
As the sun sets on my soul
In endless twilight
It is eclipsed

Hail Mary our divine
Littered souls across a great divide
In our obsession thou cast pearls before the swine

Slowly we dance with temptation
Good intentions are sold
For the price of fool's gold and sedation
Take now this demon by its hand
And slice it off

Hail Mary our divine
Littered souls across a great divide
In our obsession thou cast pearls before the swine

Take the ache beneath my bones
Peel the skin away and leave my body exposed
No grace awaits this broken soul
