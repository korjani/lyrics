So pain told you to take her
Well I learned to accept that feeling
'Cause I found how to numb it
If only for just a short while
I'd get so high, I'd forget my own name
I scarred my fist, I scarred my brain
I think that I'm going insane
I think that I'm going insane

So Drink up, so shoot in
Why must this feeling end
I crawled in my narcotic shell
Was crucified in my own hell
A gutter's where I found myself
Among the waste I chose to dwell
I chose to dwell

So now I'm in your system
And I'm what helps you numb your pain
With time you will confide in me
So lonely my friend, I've made you lose control
You'll use me more and more with time
Our friendship grows with each mainline
So glad that you could be so blind
So glad that you could be so blind

So drink up, so shoot in
'Cause I'll make this feeling end
I built you this narcotic shell
I crucifies you in your hell
Your life not yours, you're just my slave
I am your messiah of pain
And time has come to
Time has come to, time has come to
There is no time to pray

'Cause I'm your God now
