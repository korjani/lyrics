Elegies are to be sung
Winds of armageddon come
Ignorance within your bliss
Soon you will atone for this
In your carcinogenic haze
Baneful of a newer age
Flower of a different scent
Poisons of the earths lament

A requiem
Earth belong not to you
Belong all we to her

Take another deeper breath
Inhale invisible death
Pollution fills the land and sky
Forever you justify
Take a deeper look and see
Nothing's left to future seeds
Icicles melt into blood
Ashes where there once was wood

A requiem
Earth belong not to you
Belong all we to her

Pain of life has pulled you under
Left you there to bleed and wonder
Open heart left torn asunder
Wrong the wrongs that you've been suffered
Kill we scream in roaring thunder
Destroy all, leave all things plundered

Acid rain cries her pain
Full bloom, a world gone insane
Her anger the flower
Plays God with all of our lives

A requiem
Earth belong not to you
Belong all we to her
