They say we been
going down and going
down
Been traveling on the road
to nowhere
Going down, round and
round
Trying to get to the place
where we started

When I was just a boy
at four years old thought
the world was joy
As a kid I'd play, just
create the day
as I saw it my way

But time blows by

And strips us to the bone
poisoned wind of woe
Teach us that we're
alone in this world
We learned to see all the
corruption and greed
All its hate, all its pain, so
a toast to the end of our
innocence
A toast to our blank generation

They say we been
going down, been going
down
Been traveling on the road
to nowhere
Going down, round and
round
Trying to get to the place
where we started

When I was seventeen
realizing the world wasn't
what she seemed
Underneath the night San
Francisco sky
I would see, too clearly

But time blows by
And strips us to the bone
poisoned wind of woe
Teach us that we're
alone in this world
We learned to take all the
corruption and greed
All its hate, all its pain, so
a toast to the end of our
innocence
A toast to our blank generation

So here's to our collagen
lips and saline tits
To our growth hormones
and antibiotics
To the Hollywood world
we made out of Barbie doll
hearts
After we melted them down
so we could make our new
start
Here's to a generation
scared and always
wondering why
Instead of playing doctor,
we play shoot each other
and die
Instead of ring around the
Rosie, we play hide from
Mommy
'Cause Mommy's been drinking
again and we don't
want to get beat
Even with all our tattoos,
and all our cheap thrills
there's still a hole inside
of us that may not ever get
filled
So we give back a little bit
of what the world's given
us
Giving back a bit of never
giving a fuck

Here's to the justice never
dealt, to innocent, proven
guilty
Here's to bad cops turning
cheeks when real cops are
on the street
Here's to the rat-tat-n-tat
of gun shots, and your life
is shattered
Here's to "Gimme me your
cash or your brains is
gettin' splattered"
Here's to mad cow disease
and all that yummy MSG
Here's to Mickey d's serving
all those mutant chick-a-dees
This is a toast to celebrate
the end of our innocence
This is a toast to celebrate
how...
We've become desensitized
if life is to grow
some life must die

We learned to take all the
corruption and greed
All its hate, all its pain, so
a toast to the end of our
innocence
our generation
We now embrace all the
corruption
and greed, all its hate, all
its pain, so
a toast to the end of our
innocence
our blank generation.
