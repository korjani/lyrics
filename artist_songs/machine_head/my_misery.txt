you said when that day came
strength is all i had
you said when that day would come
i'll know the sound of fear
but now you ask for forgiveness
you ask for my respect
you beat upon me 'till i broke
stripping, taking
everything from me

drain me of my power
suck me of my strength
strip me of my will to live
my soul you desecrate
n'if it takes me dying
to make some history
then on to you my suffering
will ever, forever
burn in misery

i was born to reign
messiah of pain
i had earned the right
i'm the demon knight

drain me of my power
suck me of my strength
strip me of my will to live
my soul you desecrate
n' if it take me dying
to make some history
then on to you my suffering
wii ever, forever
burn in misery
