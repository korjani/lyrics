I bite the hand 'cause this hand feeds off me
Devoid of emotion, it lives to cheat
Ignorance is bliss, and respect I gave you
Friend you did claim this
Too bad you can't speak the truth

[Chorus:]
Give respect
'Cause the rule is blood for blood

Beatings is what you'll inherit this time
Fast bait, your new name
Your pain is my shine
Pulverize and break
Determination
Pleasure I negate
Your pain brings me salvation

[Chorus]

I was born of tension
Anger came from frustration
I can't back down from aggression
Some hard knocks taught me this lesson

[Chorus]
