[Music: Flynn / Demmel, Lyrics: Flynn / Duce / Demmel]

Can you hear their cries?
Nowhere can the children run to hide
Crimson rivers

Flow down the hills
Atone our ills
And woe to all her songs of love

A farewell to arms

Mutilated lives
Blackening as coffin line the sides
Filled with fathers

Who has won?
When only sons
Hold their grieving heads and mourn

A farewell to arms

Always our souls entwine
Erase this vast divide
Deaf ears our voices rest
Tyrant, this is protest

Who has won?
Yes, who has won?

[Chorus:]
I'll wave this flag of white
So the venged see the light
We'll pay for closed eyes
With our genocide

Piercing the masquerade
March to the death parade
Trade no humanity
For pearls of the slavery

In the depth of mind the heart will I find
The truth of our leader
We'll try the facts so through the cracks
May fall the lying cheater

Who has won when we're all dead?

[Chorus]

So is this how we live?
Or is this how we die?

Black blood dripping from platinum fangs
Rich blood flees while
Our poverty hangs

Shepherds they herd the mindless trance
As the flock follows the puppet's dance
In a fatal romance

[Solo: Demmel]

All that they needed was
A pretext, war's next
Heads to the chopping blocks
And our necks are next
For those we died
Who fought for our rights
Whose children now slaves
They're turning in their graves

War hawks and senators
They sit tight, so trite
Never their sons will know
What it's like to fight
But soldiers are dead
And children have bled
And the silence is numb
What have we become?

God save us

A farewell to Arms
