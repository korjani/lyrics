Go!
All my life I have been used by you
Time has come our game of love is through
Since I was born I've lived in the cold I've lived in the dark
Now I want heat now I want light igniting spark
I'm not a martyr but I am truth and you are a liar
But now my life of constant sadness goes up in the fire

I will
Be heard
And I will
Be heard

Step on me I'm here for you to see
I hope you choke as I go up in flames
I told you my problems but you never heard a word
This is the moment for once in my life I will be heard
I know there must be a better way but I don't know how
You've lied to me and you've ignored me but you won't now

I will
Be heard
And I will
Be Heard

All my life I have been used by you
Time has come our game of love is through
A burning passion from a burning mass reaches up for the sky
I've called you here my devoted family turn to watch me die
I'm not a martyr but I am truth and you are a liar
So now my life of constant sadness goes up in the fire
Yeah! One, two, three, four
