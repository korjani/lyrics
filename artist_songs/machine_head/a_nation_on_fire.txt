Well I see, I feel
On my way
You close your eyes, scared to think
You might see
A world that spends more to kill than to cure
Living, writhing, diseased, so unpure

It hardens me, the things I see
But I won't break, it gives me strength

[Chorus:]
Our suffering, won't always be
We'll dominate, this nation on fire

The media it
Blinds our eyes
A people divided
And force feds lies
The black and white societies corrode
Warring, hating, blind, a rage explodes

So take my hand across this land
I won't go down, stand my ground

[Chorus]

This nation's built on fighting war after war
And for my brothers, I will fight and stand for
'Cause I won't break, Your truth is fake
If blood ran red, You's leave me for dead
A nation on fire
A nation on fire

You tell me peace, Well I hear gunshots all night
The scars I have, I've earned 'cause I've had to fight
An endless pain, and it won't change
We just sat by, and watched this world die
A nation on fire
A nation on fire
