I was born as a bastard, no father, no master,
A shadow in silence left searching for answers

Put up for adoption and left with no option
Another kid fostered to fester forgotten

Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they’re cast into the wretched hive

But I ain’t going down alone
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe

Now I stand as a father, to men with no honor
Ashamed of the racists I used to call brothers

Cause no flag can mean bravery,
when bloodied by slavery,
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior

And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares

So will I stand here all alone?
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe

Live my life like I’ll die tonight
Dream like I’ll live forever

I have roared at the world for years
Doesn’t anybody hear me?
This burden suffered, I’ve paid the cost
Not all who wander are lost

Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe
