Fuck this place up
We turn desire to fire
electric spark to the wire
highered the stakes when we brought
this monster life
prevail by daring to fail
others content just to sail
hail the future we bring

we bring chaos to blocks
like riots to watts
blow up spots, taking the crown
off the top notch
create the pace
that you all will follow
sporadic flow buckles up
like a calico
We D-O smoke sensmilla
vodka and C-O-K-E
is the real deal
you flubber, never had to suffer
life's getting hard
and it's only get rougher

save some for me
cant stop what were going to be

[Chorus:]
walk with me
and take this seed
a fire for you
so dare to fail
will you

when my pen hits pad
it results in catastrophe
words and verbs come
to form your disaster
if you want it, you got it
never hit I spot it
now come and watch me rise

on the tools, I blew
more money than Latrell
think I know you too well
you fell and stumbled
laughing as you tumble
I guess you forgot
about the power we rock
come "ALL HAIL THE"
Machine Head battery
the good, the bad, the ugly
damaging capacity
yeah you been fucked
stuck in a rut
your life has been sucked
your tail has been tucked

save some for me
can't stop what were going to be
just watch as as i demonstrate
the reason we dominate

[chorus]

If we stand alone
and believe in whole
and you tell me
it's all I believe in
yes we stand alone
and believe in whole
if you tell me
it's all we believe in
because we
we'll chew and spit you out
and pray upon the weaker
take what we want

[chorus]
