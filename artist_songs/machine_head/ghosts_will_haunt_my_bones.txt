Let me feel my palms around your throat
Let me see the pain of lost control
Let me hear your heart racing inside
Let me see the darkness that you fight
When the night crashes down

See (No vision)
Can you believe? (Derision)
Will I fall? (Down so far)
Into the deep (It's so dark)

Ghosts will haunt my bones
So just leave me alone

Let me taste the salt within your tears
Let me swallow hope; it disappears
Let me steal the mind that makes you whole
Let me peel a layer from your soul

When the night crashes down
(See) No vision
(Can you believe?) Derision
(Will I fall?) Down so far
(Into the deep) It's so dark

Ghosts will haunt my bones

When the night crashes down
(See) No vision
(Can you believe?) Derision
(Will I fall?) Down so far
(Into the deep) It's so dark

Ghosts will haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone

In darkest night I lay awakened with
These thoughts of endless black that never quit
The tortured thoughts inside my head you see
They hide a mask of pain that's so ugly

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone

From my throat the agonies emit
My demons wrestle and my thoughts conflict
The stench of bile, as I purge this hate
An inner struggle I can't separate

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound
When the night crashes down

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound
When the night crashes
When the night crashes down
When the night crashes down
