Won't you fuck this pressure, c'mon, yeah

We turn desire to fire electric spark to the wire
Highred the stakes when we brought this monster
Life prevail by daring to fail others content just to sail
Hail the future we bring

We bring chaos to blocks like riots to watts blow up spots,
Taking the crown off the top notch
Create the pace that you all will follow
Sporadic flow buckles up like a calico
We d-o smoke sensmilla vodka and c-o-k-e is the real deal
You flubber, never had to suffer
Life's getting harder and it's only getting rougher
Save some for me can't stop what we're going to be

Walk with me and take this seed
A fire for you so dare to fail will you

When my pen hits pad it results in catastrophe
Words and verbscome to form a disaster
If you want it, you got it never hit I spot it
Now come and watch me rise

All the tools, that blew more money than latrell
You tell, I don't know you think I know you too well you feel
And stumbled laughing as you tumbled
I guess you forgot about the power we rock
'cause "all hail the" Machine Head battery
The good, the bad, the ugly
Damaging your battery yeah you been fucked stuck in a rut
Your life has been sucked your tail has been tucked

Save some for me can't stop what we're going to be
Just watch as I demonstrate the reason we dominate

Walk with me and take this seed
A fire for you so dare to fail will you

If we stand alone and believe it all
And you tell me it's all I believe in
Yes we stand alone and believe it all
If you tell me it's all we believe in
Because we'll chew and spit you out
And pray upon the weaker
Take what we want

Walk with me and take this seed
A fire for you so dare to fail will you
