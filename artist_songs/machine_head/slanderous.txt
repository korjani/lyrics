[Music: Flynn / Demmel, Lyrics: Flynn]

I'm
Wasted and ugly, I am the underbelly
A fat fuck and fairy
The reject they wish to bury

[Pre Chorus:]
They want to
Murder us, silence us
Divide and conquer us
As the lead, as we die
Let these three words decide

[Chorus:]
I love you!
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you!
Or do I hate myself?

I'm a meth head and alkie
Dumb cunt been called a junkie
A retard and a pussy
And I embrace the names you call me

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo: Demmel, Flynn, Flynn & Demmel]

I'm a redneck and faggot
The asshole ignoramus
A wetback and a nigga
And I raise my middle fingers
So those that

Murder us, silence us
Divide and conquer us
As the lead, as we die
Let these three words decide

I love you
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you
I hate myself

Love
Hate

[Chorus]
