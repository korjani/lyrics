I see the sun begin to rise
And I'm blinded too
I've seen the world through jaded eyes
That I'm crying through
I watch the darkness hypnotize
And can't fight it
Hold On I'm falling
Can't breathe anymore
As an ocean has opened
These scars need to heal over

Caress the needle prick in my eye
The tears fell like rain
I've rode the phoenix as she glides
And I've gone insane
I've seen the light of suicide
And I'm dying

Hold on, I'm falling
Can't breathe anymore
As an ocean has opened
These scars need to heal over

Hold on I'm falling, can't breathe... breathe...

Colder and colder
Just hold onto me
