One more time you've
gotten into my head
I've let your words get
into me
Every time I try to talk,
you never listen
You got the answers,
I don't know a thing
But you ask me what these
lights are in my eyes

They're a freight train
ahead
And they're straight
coming your way
You've tied yourself down
to the tracks
Now you want help from me
to cut you free
If it was me
my hour of need
You'd leave me there to
bleed

I'm fucking sick of you
and all that shit you're
pulling
Your fuckin' attitude
had better go on

You cheat and you lie
and you stole and denied
And you turned on your
friends
when you burned all those
bridges

This time you won't be
getting under my skin
What you had I've taken
away
Tell me what you're gonna
do, it doesn't matter
You're always talking, it
don't mean a thing
So ask me what these
lights are in my eyes

They're a freight train
ahead
And they're straight
coming your way
You've tied yourself down
to the tracks
Now you want help from me
to cut you free
If it was me
my hour of need
You'd leave me there to
bleed

I'm fucking sick of you
and all that shit you're
pulling
Your fuckin' attitude
had better go on

You cheat and you lie
and you stole and denied
And you turned on your
friends
when you burned all those
bridges

Well you sat there and
cried
As these words came to
glide
through your delicate skin
leaving blood on these
pages
So how does it feel
to be at one with the fate I
seal

They're a freight train
ahead
And they're straight
coming your way
You've tied yourself down
to the tracks
Now you want help from
me to cut you free
If it was me
my hour of need
You'd leave me there
to bleed

I'm fucking sick of you
and all that shit you're
pulling
Your fuckin' attitude
had better go on

You cheat and you lie
and you stole and denied
And you turned on your
friends
when you burned all those
bridges.
