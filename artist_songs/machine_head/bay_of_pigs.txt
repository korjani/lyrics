i gotta rise, i'm sick of your lies
and i won't be your scapegoat now
ain't gonna bend and won't 'til the end
understalnd on my word i vow

a pig, a pig, that's all you'll ever be
refuse to cower to the swine
i'm sick of it, at the end of my wits
the next time that you fuck with mine

i'm gonna snap like i never have before

[chorus:]
your law's the flow
upon this nation
your lies despised
by generations

i got a friend might not walk again
and your laws never helped at all
go fuck your clause, your probable cause
power trippin' above us tall

afraid, afraid and so you better be
'cause when i call you're not around
serve and protect and give some respect
'cause next time that you shake me down

i'm gonna snap like i never have before

[chorus:]
your lies despised
your law's the flaw
upon this nation
upon this nation
upon this nation
your lies despised
by generations
