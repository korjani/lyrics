The drum beats on as I fall in trance
Stepping away from the endless dance
My enemies in the endless abyss
The snakes slithering out of the mist
No subtleties truth is all that I ask
No pleasantries you can take off that mask
This world has left me bruised and callous
Empty heart is filled with malice
Cold
A blackened hole where there was once a soul

No tender mercies here
Endure and persevere
Erase the obstacles that try to find me
Fight through their ignorance
Suffer my persistence
Eclipse the light that will try to blind me

Take me through the fire
And if you lift me up then I will follow
Take me through the fire
So take me through the fire

Too many voices fill the empty void
Too many choices and were left devoid
The killing fields fill with bodies dead
The sun goes down and last rites are read
Cause even now I keep my ear to the streets
And they whisper to me your deceits
You better sleep with one eye open
Never let my name be spoken ill
Don't make me send the lions out to kill

No tender mercies here
Endure and persevere
Erase the obstacles that try to find me
Fight through their ignorance
Suffer my persistence
Eclipse the light that will try to blind me

Take me through the fire
And if you lift me up then I will follow
Take me through the fire
So take me through the fire

I will prevail
I'm stone and shale
Obsidian
Your oblivion
Becomes

No tender mercies here
Endure and persevere
Erase the obstacles that try to find me
Fight through their ignorance
Suffer my persistence
Eclipse the light that will try to blind me

Take me through the fire
And if you lift me up then I will follow
Take me through the fire
So take me through the fire

And as I fight on through weary eyes
I take your head as we walk through Fire
Take me through the fire
