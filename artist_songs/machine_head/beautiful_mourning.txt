[Music: Flynn / Demmel, Lyrics: Flynn]

Fuck you all!

My redemption is knowing
This will be over
My aggression, I fear I've lost control

Who is this man I stare?
Mirror reflects a stranger
Fist shatters the despair
Awake the pain to anger

[Chorus:]
How do I close thine eyes of murder?
How do I close thine eyes of murder?
Staring into me?

My obsession is dying, sinking me deeper
My depression, this world has disavowed

Razor at wrist I seethe
The flesh is peeled apart now
Gone is my faded dream
Failure, I welcome in thou

[Chorus]

This lifetime in sorrow,
God let the angels die
This is our last goodbye,
In love and death we cry
Our last goodbye

[Solo: Flynn]

No, no, no, no

Spit in the face of loss
Coward, my own self-hatred
No more I bear this cross
Struggle, and rise from the dead

This lifetime in sorrow,
God let the angels die
This is our last goodbye,
In love and death we cry
Our last goodbye
