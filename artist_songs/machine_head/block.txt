Hate breeds hate my eyes they have seen
the decimation of all that is pure pure
A system that feeds the machine with
the blood, sweat and money of the poor poor
Corruption gets rich, honesty just exists
'cause nobody cares anymore anymore

Fuck it all
Fuck it all

White attack black, black attack back
the fuckin' media keeps us all blind blind
Children on crack, junkies on smack
you wanna close your eyes to hide hide
Pollution so dense, sickening existence
new world order, new world decline

Fuck it all
Fuck it all

The more the sense of ignorance
The more intense is the pain

Hate breeds hate my eyes they have seen
the decimation of all that is pure pure
A system that feeds the machine with
the blood, sweat and money of the poor poor
Believe in something if it stops your suffering
'cause all we have is nothing nothing

Fuck it all
