Can't match the stare within these eyes
Do you have the strength for all your lies
Can't stand the pain with which i seethe
This integrity is what i breathe
I inhale this life i gave to you
And exhale the vile

Time will tell
Because my friend and
Never will I concede the end
Cause cataract resin fills my eyes
Never gonna see the man
Through your fake lies

Tell me the things
that'll take time
To help see the things
That'll take this
Burn inside of me

Can't feel the sting from words gone by
Can't keep the papers filled with lies
Ten fold, this confidence I breed
Created back the words I see
I'll inhale this gift I gave to you
And exhale desire

Kill this fire with gasoline
Convictions I spit, my faith obscene
Heretic Jackals worship liars
Forever I'll be the god that you desire

Tell me the things that'll take time
To help see the things that'll take this
And hold onto things that'll make my
To make me the thing that breaks this
Burn inside of me

Time will tell because my friend and
Never will I concede the end
Heretic Jackals worship liars
Forever I'll be the god that you desire

Tell me the things that'll take time
To help see the things that'll take this
And hold onto things that'll make my
To make me the thing that breaks this
Burn inside of me
Burn inside of me
Burn inside of me
Burn inside of me
