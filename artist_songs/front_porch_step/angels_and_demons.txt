You've got two eyes that took me by surprise when you walked by. 
I think that I could die a thousand deaths and still turn out just fine, 
If I could just see your face every day of my life

Well I see you're sad but we're both sad, and I see you cry and it makes me mad. 
I see the good in all your bad. Lets take this shitty life we have 
And throw it down the drain and run away. Just you & I

Well love don’t tell us what to do. 
It only shows us what we need. 
And whenever I'm alone with you, 
I know I'm where I want to be

You're the angel that gives me reason but I can't begin to count my demons. 
Somehow you still keep me dreamin'. You let me know my life has meaning. 
I’ll find that boy that left you bleeding. Whispered "love" and you believed him. 
I begged and begged for you to leave him. I swear I'll kill 'em when I see him.

I love you more than words can say but I can’t take your breath away, 
Or be the prince that saves the day, 'cause I'll rub your feet, but I’m not your slave. 
I thought that you should know that I'll forever love you so.

Well love don’t tell us what to do. 
It only shows us what we need. 
And whenever I'm alone with you, 
I know I'm where I want to be

God cuffed the devil 'cause he had my soul. 
Cut off his hands and claimed he stole. 
The devil sat there bleeding and crying, all confused. 

'Cause when I signed that paper to give him his share. 
Me and Mr. Lucifer were both unaware 
That the soul that I sold him had long belonged to you.

And love don’t tell us what to do. 
It only shows us what we need. 
And whenever I'm alone with you, 
I know I'm where I want to be
