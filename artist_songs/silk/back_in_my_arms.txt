[Intro] 
ooh, oh 
Oh, I need you 
Baby, baby, I 

You used to say and naturally I would be saying sorry 
But I would never listen to you 
Now I'm paying for it 
Baby love, please forgive me 

So many days of leaving messages on your answering machine 
Sometimes I thought I'm droppin by 
But you'd probably make a scene 
I can't understand why you're so mean to me, yeah 

[1]
Baby, I want you 
Back in my arms again 
In my arms again 

Baby I need you 
Back in my arms again 
I need you in my arms again 

Oh I miss you baby 
Are you the type of girl who likes to say I told you so 
I learned my lesson tell me 
What are you trying to prove 
Girl, I miss you 
I'm realizing that I never should have let you go 
I made a decision when I wasn't sure 
How could I be so immature, oh 

[Repeat 1]

We used to laugh we used to kiss while dancing in the rain 
(I wanna laugh, I wanna dance, I wanna kiss, I still remmember) 
I messed it up by giving someone else your wedding ring 
(I wanna make, I wanna make, I wanna make it up to you, girl) 
I'll tell you I'm sorry if you tell me it will ease the pain 
(I was insane, I was insane, I was insane to ever let you go) 
Now I know that you reap what you sow 

[Repeat 1 with ad libs until fade]
