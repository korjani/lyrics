[Intro] 
Yeah, come on 
I got hooked on you, oh oh 
(You got me hooked, baby) 

[1]
There's no living without you 
Got me hooked on everything you do 
No living without you 
Got me hooked on everything you do 

It means the world to me 
If you stay with me 
But I know what goes around 
Comes around (Come here baby) 
Even though I want this to be 
He'll have chains lady lay, oh yeah 

There goes your pager 
Then an hour later 
It's time to go 
But you don't tell me so, no no no 

You say you're coming back 
And I believe you're coming back 
I want you for me 

[Repeat 1]

Oh I tell myself 
You are mine and no one else 
Yeah, can have ya, oh yeah 
Even though in jealousy 
I'm running in the league 
But you don't know how much you mean to me 

There goes your pager 
And an hour later 
It's time to go 
But you don't tell me so, oh no 

You say you're coming back 
And I believe you're coming back 
It's just not the same without you 

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

I don't want the rest 
Girl, you are the best 
And you know 
What am I to do 
If I ever loose you 
I'd rather be by myself 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
