See, I been watching you from afar 
Twinkling like the star that you are 
And I'll take it personal 
If you say that you can't go 
Oh just wanna give you thrills you know I will 
Oh me oh my 
You're shining so bright 
You're a twnkle in my eye

If I can get you in my car 
No matter how far, I'll come and get you 
Cuz you're my superstar 
Hear me twinkle on my girl, where you are 

If I can get you in my car 
No matter how hard, I'm gonna get you 
Cuz you my superstar 
Hear me twinkle on my girl, where you are 

I'm doing ninety in a sixty mile zone 
Trying to quickly get you to my throne 
Cuz you my queen, and I'm your king 
Now soup it up so we can do this thing 

And I want you, and you want me 
How can we do it hmmm, let me see 
You need a ride, I got a ride 
You can't run and you can't hide, no
