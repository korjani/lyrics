[Intro]
Umm, promises, promises, promises 
Baby, promise that you'll never leave me 
Baby, promise that we'll always be 
Together, forever 
Please don't go 

[1]
Lady, promise that you'll never leave me 
Babe, promise that we'll always be 
Don't go, don't go 

I'm leaving you this message 
I'm sorry that I couldn't be home 
But one night while I was out on the road 
I didn't spend the night alone, no 
I let my weakness get the best of me 
She was just a one night stand 
I know I was wrong 
Just don't leave me alone 
Without you in my life 
I'm only half a man 

[Tamar]
I got your message 
And I can't believe the things you said 
Now that the shoe is on the other foot 
It's messing with my head, oh 

[Repeat 1] 

[Tamar]
I'm writing you this letter 
Cuz I couldn't tell you face to face 
I let temptations get the best of me 
I know it was a big mistake. baby 
No I don't ever wanna loose your love 
Cuz my heart couldn't take the pain 
I know I was wrong 
Just don't leave me alone 
Cuz nothin in my life would ever be the same 

[Silk]
I got your letter 
And I can't believe the things I read, no 
Now that the shoe is on the other foot 
It's messin' with my head, oh 

[Repeat 1 with ad libs until fade]
