Step right up, hurry hurry, before the show begins, my friend.
Stand in line, get your tickets, I hope you will attend.
It'll only cost you fifty cents to see.
What life has done to those like you and me.
See the man, with a broken heart you'll see that he is sad. 
He hurts so bad.
See the girl who has lost the only love she ever had.
There's got to be no sadder show to see.
No doubt about it satisfactions guaranteed.

[chorus]
So let the side show begin hurry hurry, step right on in. 
Can't afford to pass it by, guaranteed to make you cry.
Side show begin (hurry hurry) step right on in.
Can't afford to pass it by, guaranteed to make you cry.

See the man, who's been crying, for a million years.
So many tears.
See the girl, who's collecting broken hearts for souvenirs.
It's more exciting than a one man band.
The saddest little show in all the land.

[chorus]
