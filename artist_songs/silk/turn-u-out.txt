[Intro] 
Hey, yeah 
Love you S-I-L-K 
2,000 Watts, where we bring music to the future 
Now, all of you Silk people 
Listen to the record and you tell me 
Exactly how you feel 

You said a good love is too hard to find 
That's cuz you ain't never had nobody 
Make you lose your mind 
All it takes is a little know how 
Sensitivity 
I took some time to find out what it takes my baby 
To fulfill your need 
So when you need someone, babe 
(You need me) 
To bring it on without a doubt 
(Bring it on) 
Just call on me baby 
I'll be right there to turn you out 

[1]
Baby I'm right here for ya 
To kiss you and hold you tight 
Give you some real good lovin 
Turn you out 

Ease your mind and chill your body 
Make you scream and shout 
Love you all through the night 
Turn you out 

Well, make up your mind 
What you want me to do 
Do you want me to leave you alone, baby 
Or do you want me to love you 
I got all night baby 
I know you're a little scared right now 
That's ok just come on and close the door baby 
Lets make love anyhow 
Cuz you needed someone baby 
To give you a little love with no doubt 
(Bring it on) 
You doubt love never baby 
And now I'm here to turn you out 

[Repeat 1]

Break it down 
I wanna know, babe 
Did I make you feel real good tonight 
Did I make you sweat all over your sexy body baby 
Did I make you trem, tremble 
Did I make you want some more 
Just tell me, tell me 
Did I turn you out 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
