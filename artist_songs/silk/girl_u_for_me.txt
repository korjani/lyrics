Just ask and I'll do (ask and I will do)
I'll do it for you (I'll do it just for you)
There'll be no more games that we'll play

Ooh la lala la la lala la la lala la

[Verse 1:]
Tonight is the night (the night)
And the moon is bright (so bright)
Baby let me tell you
I'm in love with you tonight
The more love we make (we make)
And the more love we take (we take)
Baby can I tell you (oh my baby)
I won't let you get away

[Chorus:]
Girl you for me
And girl me for you
I don't care what people might say
Just ask and I'll do
I'll do it for you (you know I want ya girl)
There'll be no more games that we play

[Verse 2:]
The night that we met (na na na na)
Is the night I won't forget
How you touched my heart
And you made me realize (made me realize)
I knew you were the one
After all was said and done
Baby let me tell you (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
That I want you by my side (ooh ooh ooh)

[Chorus:]
Girl you for me (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And girl me for you (I love you baby)
I don't care what people might say (I don't care what they say)
Just ask and I'll do (ask and I will do)
I'll do it for you (I'll do it just for you)
There'll be no more games that we play

[Spoken:]
Hmm I'm feeling real freaky tonight

[Chorus:]
Girl you for me
And girl me for you (me for you)
I don't care what people might say

Just ask and I'll do (I'll do it baby)
I'll do it for you (I'll do it for you hey)
There'll be no more games that we play (I'm telling you
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play about)

Girl you for me
And girl me for you (you got me crying girl)
I don't care what people might say (I'm begging)
Just ask and I'll do (I'm down on my knees begging you please)
