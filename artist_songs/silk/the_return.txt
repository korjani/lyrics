Oh Lord you know this road is mighty rough 
But you've been so good, you took good care of us 
Sometimes you know we might give out 
But we won't give up 
(No, no, no) 

Now as we leave and go our separate ways 
Tell all our friends that we'll be back some day 
Now we leave, but you know we will... 

We will return 
(Oh, we'll return) 
Gotta come back to you 
(Coming back to you) 
Gotta come back to you 
(Oh we will, we will) 
We will return 
(Oh you know, you know we will) 
Gotta come back to you 
(Coming to you) 
Gotta come back to you 
(Why, cuz we love you) 

It's all about love 
(Yes we do, babe) 
It's all about love 
(Oh it's all about spreadin' our love all over) 
It's all about love 
Return 

It's all about love 
(We love you today) 
It's all about love 
(We love you always) 
It's all about love 
Return 

We'll return oh, hey 
We will return 
We will return 
Because we love you 
From the bottom of our hearts 

We know it's been a long time since you seen 
And heard from us guys 
Ya know, I guess, 
I guess that's why we felt like we should 
We should dedicate this song to ya 

It's been a long ride for us 
It's all good now 
We love ya, we hope you enjoy the return of Silk 
Tonight
