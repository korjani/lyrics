Just one look at your body
And my heart begins to bounce
You're looking good in everything you wear
I like having you around
And your lips, and your smile
Girl you know that you're driving me wild
I like the sexy way you wear your hair
Wanna take you everywhere
Cause you know your loving's so

Sexcellent
Marvelous
Eloquent
Magnificent
Sexcellent
Marvelous
Sexcellent

When I gaze into your pretty eyes
Girl you know you got me hypnotized
And when I get my hands on you
Lemme tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna give you loving
That makes your body tingle through and through
Cause your lips, oh your smile
Girl you know that you're driving me wild
I like the sexy way you wear your hair
Wanna take you everywhere

[1]

I never ever had to dream about nobody else
Cause you're my every thing I want you all to myself
You know I gotta thank the Lord above
For sending me you
Baby you make me whole
And without your love I'm through
Sexcellent

[Spoken:]
So sexy
Damn you're so marvelous
Eloquent
You're so magnificent baby
You're sexy
Sexcellent
