[Intro] 
I know sometimes it's hard 
To put our pride aside 
When all we should do is just say 
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry, baby 

All alone in my room 
I see visions of you 
And I think to myself 
What went wrong 

As I sit here with my pain 
Knowing I'm the one to blame 
Had to play those silly games 
Now there's no refrain, refrain 

[1]
I should of listened when you cried 
I should of opened up my eyes 
Too busy holding on to pride 
I didn't hear you say goodbye 

[2]
So how do I say I'm sorry 
When you're gone 
How do I say that you were right 
And baby I was wrong 

I can feel that old black water 
Commin' down on me strong 
Cuz see, I had a real good something 
And now I'm sitting here with nothing 
I'm drowning, can somebody help me 
Tell me how to say I'm sorry 

So yesterday I sat and wrote these words 
And tried not to cry 
Guess it's true what they say 
You never miss your water 'till your well runs dry 

I miss your face, your faults, your laughter 
Your tears, the way you smile (I miss your smile) 
Can't nobody take your place 
Damn girl, I really miss your sweet embrace 

[Repeat 1]
