Every time I think about 
All the little freaky things you do
Make me wanna touch you girl
You make me wanna rush all into you

Even though I'm hanging out
Just page me girl
That's all you gotta do
Never had a love so good and baby
I'm glad that you're my boo

Let's make love
(Whoa, like the very very very first time)
I wanna make love
(Can I feel you up from behind, yeah)
Can we make love
(Baby, I wanna hear you tell me that it's all mine mine mine mine)
Can we, can we make love
(Can we make love)
Can we, can we make love
Can we make love

Feels so good to be inside
I'm glad you let me in between your thighs
Let me lick you up and down
Please your body til' you scream out loud
Toss your body back and forth
Turn around
So I can watch you ride, yeah
I like the way you make me sweat
Oh baby, your love has got me high

Let's make love
(Yeah, oh baby, like the very first time)
I wanna make love
(Oh yeah, baby can I feel you up from behind, yeah)
Can we make love
(Oh, baby tell me that it's all mine, babe)
Can we, can we make love
(Oh tell me babe it's all mine, all mine)
Can we, can we make love
Can we make love

Well it's been awhile
Since I've had someone
Turn me on from head to toe, baby
(Girl, you're all I want)
You're all I need
(Girl, you're all I need)
So let's make love
(Make love, make love)
Cuz babe, make me so horney
Ain't loved you in a long time
