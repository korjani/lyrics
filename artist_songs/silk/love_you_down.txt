[Intro] 
Let me love you down 
Love you down 
Love you down 

Scene around and around tonight 
You're feeling so hot 
Trying to think of ways 
How can I get you here to my spot 
Oh what am I gonna do 
Cuz I'm still wanting you 
That night we spent was forever 
And baby let me love you down 
All the way down 
Oh, and that's what I say 
I'll be damned if I sit here alone 
And you are killin' me softly 
With your sexy sex appeal girl 

[1]
Let me love you down, baby 
Early morn' 'till the break of dawn 
I wanna hold you, kiss ya 
Squeeze ya, touch you 
Love you down 

Let me love you down, baby 
Early morn' 'till the break of dawn 
I wanna hold ya kiss ya 
Squeeze ya, touch you 
Love you down 
Said 

Come on in, sit on down 
Let me just relax you 
Blazin' to the sexy sounds 
Tell me what you wanna do 
Can I get a kiss 
Can I get a hug (Please) 
Damn do I have to get down on my knees girl 
And you know and I know and we know 
Where we wanna go so 
Oh, lets get down to business 
Cuz I've been waiting too long 
It's gotta go down now with you 

[Repeat 1]

Oh, let me love you slow 
Oh, let me stroak gently 
You know I know 
Oh you know I want to 
You know what I need 
I'll be loving you down 

[Ad lib until fade]
