Go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Put it all behind 
For you 

Show 
Let it show 
Let it show 
That you're not afraid of this 
For you 

And there's only one person I know 
That is worth all the time in the world 
It's you 

Life 
This short life 
This sweet life 
Is all I've got
I've got for you 

And there's only one person I know 
That is worth all the time in the world 
It's you 
It's you 

It's you that makes me feel it 
You that makes me feel so alive 
So alive
It's you
It's you

Born
We were born
We were born in this world of hope
I hope it's you

And there's only one person I know 
That is worth all the time in the world 
It's you 
It's you 

It's you that makes me feel it 
You that makes me feel so alive 
So alive

It's you
It's you
It's you that makes me feel it 
You that makes me feel so alive 
So alive

Don't call off all your feelings
And sew off all your clothes
To forget me
To forget me

All dried up in this weather
Been tied up since forever
So let me
Just let me

It's you 
It's you
It's you that makes me feel it 
You that makes me feel so alive 
So alive

It's you 
It's you
It's you that makes me feel it 
You that makes me feel so alive 
So alive

It's you 
It's you 
It's you
It's you
