Well you're sick, sick, sickness spreads 
Through those veins into your bed 
A fiend fakes out smiles instead 
While I wait here alone 

So what, my conscience bothers me 
So what, that's who I've got to be 
Oh God, how inspirational 
Don't take all this shit personal 

I don't mind, mind the time 
The time it takes to find you 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go on 

If looks could kill, she's killed for less 
The less you are convinced 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go

Well you're sick, sick, eyes are dull 
Feeling like some criminal 
I know you got a better place to go 
While I drink here alone 

So what, my conscience bothers me 
So what, that's who I've got to be 
Oh God, how inspirational 
Don't take all this shit personal 

I don't mind, mind the time 
The time it takes to find you 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go on 

If looks could kill, she's killed for less 
The less you are convinced 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go 

Looking out the corner of her blue angelic eyes 
(Hold your breath, hold your breath, hold your breath) 
Trying to find a place inside the world that you despise 

Looking out the corner of her blue angelic eyes 
(Hold your breath, hold your breath, hold your breath) 
Trying to find a place inside the world that you despise 

I don't mind, mind the time 
The time it takes to find you 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go on 

If looks could kill, she's killed for less 
The less you are convinced 
Go on, go on and thrill me 
Go on, go on, go
Go on, go
