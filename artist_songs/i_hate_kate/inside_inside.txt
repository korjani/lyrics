Pretend I'm not alive 
Pretend to fall in line 
Pretend that you are not pretending 
Detached from comprehending 
As you sleep alone 
As you sleep alone tonight 

I feel the urgency 
I feel you next to me 
I feel that happiness is boring 
She's drinking all the chlorine 
As I sleep alone 
As I sleep alone tonight 

On the inside 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
The movie in your mind 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Slow motion suicide 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Is it safe to hide on the inside? 

On the inside 

The time will pass us by 
The time of cheap surprise 
The time of reckoning is coming 
So spend your whole life running 
And don't sleep alone 
And don't sleep alone at night 

I feel the urgency 
I feel you next to me 
I feel that happiness is boring 
She's drinking all the chlorine 
As I sleep alone 
As I sleep alone tonight 

On the inside 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
The movie in your mind 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Slow motion suicide 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Is it safe to hide on the inside? 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
The movie in your mind 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Slow motion suicide 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Is it safe to hide on the inside? 

On the inside 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
The movie in your mind 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Slow motion suicide 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Is it safe to hide on the inside? 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
The movie in your mind 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Slow motion suicide 
(Inside, inside, inside, inside) 
Is it safe to hide on the inside? 

On the inside 

On the inside 

On the inside 

On the inside
