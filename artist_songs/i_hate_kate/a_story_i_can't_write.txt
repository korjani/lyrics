Well, it's been three weekends in a row 
That I've been sitting at home 
Not going out at all 
Sometimes I get the feeling 
That's how it's gonna be for the rest of me 

It's like a little taste to pass time by 
Or a leader who falls and you ask why 
I ask why we're here 
And you are gone 
You are gone 
And that's a story I can't write 

A story I can't write 
A story I can't write 
A song I can't sing 
A battle that I just can't fight 
A story I can't write 
A story where you'd be here 
You and I 
And everyone would know 
They'd know it's our world 
It's our world 
It's our world 

Well, sometimes I see some friends around town 
Pretend I'm fine and everything's alright 
They still talk about bringing it back 
And I don't know if I'm down with that 

It's like a little taste to pass time by 
Or a leader who falls and you ask why 
I ask why we're here 
And you are gone 
You are gone 
And that's a story I can't write 

A story I can't write 
A story I can't write 
A song I can't sing 
A battle that I just can't fight 
A story I can't write 
A story where you'd be here 
You and I 
And everyone would know 
They'd know it's our world 
It's our world 
It's our world 
Our world 

I can bring you home 
Bring you home 
And that's a story I can't write 

A story I can't write 
A story I can't write 
A song I can't sing 
A battle that I just can't fight 
A story I can't write 
A story where you'd be here 
You and I 
And everyone would know 
They'd know it's our world 

Story I can't write 
A battle I can't fight 
Story I can't write 
A battle I can't fight
