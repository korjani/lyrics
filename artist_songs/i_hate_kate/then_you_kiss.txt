What you're cooking in the kitchen 
Is it more of your bitchin' attitude 
That you give, that you give, that you give 
But I don't want it 
I won't have it 
Oh, not today 

Well I saw you in the city 
You were looking really pretty 
All your friends, all your friends, all your friends were acting very strangely towards me 
You're up to no good 
Oh, not today 

Pull me from this paranoia 

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys 

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys 

You know you make me laugh 
You know you make me sick 
Telling all my friends that I got a small attention span 
That's not what you told me, not what you told me 
Not what you told me when you told me you loved me 
No, oh, oh

And now we never walked down that street 
And we never danced to that beat 
And we never bring it down 
Down, down, oh like we used to 
You're up to no good 
Oh, not today 

Pull me from this paranoia 

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys

Is it a girl? 
Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
You're getting under my skin 
Is it a girl? 
Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
Fingers pointing back at me no more 

Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
Miss then you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie 
Then you kiss, then you kiss 
Then you kiss, then you try 
Then you miss, then you miss 
When you lie 
Then you kiss 
Then you kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
