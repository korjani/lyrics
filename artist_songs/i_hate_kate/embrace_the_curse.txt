I am a hologram 
I am the ghost that's laying next to you 
Watching you breathe 
I am a wanted man 
Feels so electric as they're chasing me 
Still I can't sleep 

It's me against the world today 
And that's fine
It's me against the world

And so I stand 
I embrace the curse 
I embrace the song 
I embrace what I feel 
When I feel what's wrong 
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse 
I embrace what I am 
I embrace the curse 

Tonight is our escape 
Today integrity is killing me 
Still I can't see 
The choices that we make 
Are not the choices they want us to make 
Who asked them anyway 

It's me against the world today 
And that's fine
It's me against the world

And so I stand 
I embrace the curse 
I embrace the song 
I embrace what I feel 
When I feel what's wrong 
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse 
I embrace what I am 
I embrace the curse 

I know you know exactly what I mean 
I know you know what I feel 
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel 

It's me against the world today 
And that's fine
It's me against the world

I embrace the curse 
I embrace the song 
I embrace what I feel 
When I feel what's wrong 
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse 
I embrace what I am 
I embrace the curse 

I embrace the curse 
I embrace the song 
I embrace what I feel 
When I feel what's wrong 
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse 
I embrace what I am 
I embrace the curse
