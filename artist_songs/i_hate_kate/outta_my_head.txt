Attraction 
Traction 
More than your reaction 
Action to the touch 
Imagine, magine you've given up so much 

I keep making all the same resolutions
Remaining nameless for the sake of confusion 
The future's got me worried about postulation 
Get you out of my head, my head, out of my head 

There's no word that don't get said that confuse me 
Every good intention left to abuse me 
Set the world on fire waking up screaming 
Get you outta my head, my head, outta my head 

Outta my head 
Outta my head 
Outta my head
