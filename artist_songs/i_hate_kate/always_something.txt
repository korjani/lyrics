Well it's 4 AM and it seems to me 
Tonight's not going down in history 
But I'll tell you something honey 
It's always better when I'm with you 

The glitz and glamour and all the fame 
All the big stars trying to make a name 
And I'll tell you something else 
It's always better when I'm with you 

It's always better when I'm with you 
It's always better when I'm with you 
It's always better when I'm with you 

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you 
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through 
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me 

Well call the records and stop the press 
And did I tell you that I'm impressed with your 
Beautiful smile and your plastic dress 
But I've got a girl for me at home 

The kids are hanging out in Leicester Square 
Looking at me like I even care 
But I'll tell you something else 
It's always better when I'm with you 

It's always better when I'm with you 
It's always better when I'm with you 
It's always better when I'm with you 

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you 
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through tonight 

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you 
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through 
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me 

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you 
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through tonight 

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you 
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through 
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me 

Tonight you're part of me 
Tonight you're part of 
You're part of me
