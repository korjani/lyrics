Well, her name is Little Miss new in town
She said I need someone to show me around
I said what the hell
She looked innocent as far as I could tell

She said I'm all alone and come up into my room
And I'll show you pictures of me and my favorite band
She said uh oh uh oh here they come
Uh oh uh oh here they come
Uh oh uh oh here they come
Better run
Better run
Better run

I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
She makes me happy

It's another day and another cut
She said kiss me fool I'm not a slut
If the eyes are the windows to the soul
Her soul's somewhere in Mexico
And slow down shut off the power
This taste is getting sour
I feel a sickness coming over me

She said uh oh uh oh here they come
Uh oh uh oh here they come
Uh oh uh oh here they come
Better run
Better run
Better run

I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
She makes me happy

I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
She makes me happy

Crazy in the head
Crazy in the bed
I know that's not a lie

Crazy in the head
Crazy in the bed
I better make her mine

I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
She makes me happy

I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
I'm in love with a sociopath (hey!)
She makes me happy
