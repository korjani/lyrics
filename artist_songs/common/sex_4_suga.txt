What's your name I can't hear ya
Would it be alright If I call you Suga
You can call me smokey I'll be the bear
Your smell is sexy its all in the air 
What ya got girl its so unfair 
I like the way you move so keep it right there
Or you can do what you want to do 
Im just glad im in front of you
But I don't mind bein behind
Cause imma touch you where the sun don't shine
Got my hand on the money while you on the grind
In tune with you cause you so fine 
And when you wine its genuwine 
Get on my vine and we can climb

Heard you use to dance at Magic city 
The other girls couldn't been half as pretty
You look so sexy when you grab them (ohhhhhh!!) oh yes
Suga good Lord you've been blessed 
If this is a sin I must confess 
The way you dress is like birdless 
I guess you don't mind bein undressed 
I like the way its going down
Hips are moving all around
Round and round upside down 
I once was lost but now im found 
Sweet heart can you give me another round 
Sweating like you losing pounds
Touch the ground make it sound 
Suga oh suga you wear the crown

Wanna touch and feel ya we can get familar
