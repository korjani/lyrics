[1st Verse]
Victory won, in a world of hennessy and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles, we
Fought for ours, parted in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognized importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises
And street life is pumpin' fast lives, and
I watched Crash and realized that we're all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins, jus' because I thought about it

[Chorus]
Living
Once Again
We...

Living
Then you're gone [x4]

[2nd Verse]
Ashes and snow falls, I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I'm never gon' run
Sooner than later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang, and gang bang to maintain
Afghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the wire I learned to earn hard
Watched gangstas turn God in the midst of War
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we lived forever through song

[Chorus x2]

[Common's Father]
Origin is forever
Well, well well,
We are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey, I don't need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up cue cards
What that say
Oh they say; "just talk, don't sing"
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here
Forever
30 years old red eyes,
Beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 values
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of the chime
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever,
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Ok...
I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand

To universal scales of humanity
All humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, Hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, War, and more War
Floods, Columbine, Global Warming, Earthquakes
Another somebody's done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, there's not a hole but to Heck
We're still, did you place your one grain of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend the part of humanity
Sift the ingredients of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atone
We gonna work with the four A's here
Forever part
Common good is forever
God's memory is forever....
