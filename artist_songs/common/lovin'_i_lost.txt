[Hook]
I remember, I remember the days

[Verse 1]
I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is gunna get ya
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the benches
I was tripping, I even called her sister
How could someone you could talk to, each and every day
That you 'bout to marry, be on their merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

[Hook]
I remember, I remember, I remember
(It happens to the best, so I love and I lost)
I remember, I remember, I remember

[Verse 2]
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it comes from not seeing my dad, keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying God bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?
