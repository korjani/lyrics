When the evenin' sun goes down
You will find me hangin' 'round
The nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used to bes
The nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues they're playing
Ohhh listen to what the blues are saying

Ohhh mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
You know the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Ohhh when the evenin' sun goes down
You would find me hangin' 'round
Oh the nightlife
Ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used to bes
You know the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Ohhhh the nightlife
Ain't no good life
But it's my life
