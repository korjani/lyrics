I worship you and the things you do
Still you're not satisfied
I paid the cost, I've loved, I've lost
But still I worship you

When we first fell in love we were always side by side
Never then did I think you'd go wrong
Then you started goin' out with the wrong kind of crowd
To my sorrow I've found that you've gone

Well, I worship you and the things you do
Still you're not satisfied
I paid the cost, I've loved, I've lost
But still I worship you

I go back to the home and I lie awake 'til dawn
Still I can't get you out of my life
And my friends next day say what a price I must pay
Last night I saw someone with your wife

Well, I worship you and the things you do
Still you're not satisfied
I paid the cost, I've loved, I've lost
But still I worship you
I paid the cost, I've loved, I've lost
But still I worship you
