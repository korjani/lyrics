Lost in the conversation
It was hard to say goodnight
Standing at the station, tossing it all around
Easy as the rain came down

Both of us were used to losing
Guess we had some tales to tell
Suddenly they seemed amusing, till it came
Easy as the rain came in

When the train pulled in
I knew right then
You weren't going anywhere
And when the train pulled out
There was no doubt
Left in our minds

That was many years ago dear
Though they haven't all been kind
They take on a certain glow when I hear the sound
Rain falling on the ground
Easy as the rain came down
