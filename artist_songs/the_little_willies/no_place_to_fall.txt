If I had no place to fall
and I needed to
could I count on you
to lay me down?

I'd never tell you no lies
I don't believe it's wise
you've got pretty eyes
won't you spin me 'round

I ain't much of a lover it's true
I'm here then I'm gone
and I'm forever blue
but I'm sure wanting you

Skies full of silver and gold
try to hide the sun
but it can't be done
least not for long

And if we help each other grow
while the light of day
shines down our way
then we can't go wrong

Time, she's a fast old train
she's here then she's gone
and she won't come again
won't you take my hand

If I had no place to fall
and I needed to
could I count on you
to lay me down?
