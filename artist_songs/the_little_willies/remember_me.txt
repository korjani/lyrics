You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity. 
But all those vows are broken now, and I will never
Be the same except in memory.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming,
Remember me at the close of a long, long day. 
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear, 
Another love with a heart more bold and free. 
But in the end, fair-weather friends may break your heart, dear. 
If they do, sweetheart, remember me.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming,
Remember me at the close of a long, long day. 
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.
Oh, just to know you still remember me.
