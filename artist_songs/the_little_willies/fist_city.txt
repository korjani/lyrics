You've been makin' your brags 'round town
That you've been lovin' my man
But the man I love when he picks up trash,
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me,
And what I feel is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City,
You'd better detour 'round my town
Cause I'll grab you by the hair of the head
And I'll lift you off the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City,
You'd better detour 'round my town
Cause I'll grab you by the hair of the head
And I'll lift you off the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
