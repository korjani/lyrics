Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leavin'
I said, "Shove off honey, baby, I ain't grievin'
You can pack your bags and pull out this evenin'
There's a wide open road"

Come early this mornin' you were nowhere about it
So I searched the town but you done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

There's a wide open road
Leadin' south from my abode
If you can stick around and keep your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin' for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat was still around
And you left your diamond ring when you walked down
That wide open road

Well if you gonna stay away then honey gotta let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll the dough
Everything's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down that wide open road

There's a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can head back home
And there's a wide open road
Oh, there's a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can head back home
And there's a wide open road
