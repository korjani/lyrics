There's a foul owl on the prowl tonight.

Hey, little lark, get outta the dark,
Foul owl on the prowl.
Hey little jay, stay out of his way,
Foul owl on the prowl.
You just might be the quail he'll tail,
Foul owl on the prowl.
You just might be the swallow he'll follow,
Foul owl on the prowl.

If you hear him hoot, scoot,
If you pass his tree, flee,
If you catch his eye, fly,
Don't wait to say goodbye.

He's got a yen for a purty little hen,
Foul owl on the prowl.
He's hungry for a chick, so get home quick,
Foul owl on the prowl.

If you hear him hoot, scoot,

He's got a yen for a purty little hen,

He's hungry for a chick, so get home quick,
Foul owl on the prowl.
Foul owl on the prowl.
Foul owl on the prowl.
Foul owl on the prowl.
Foul owl on the prowl.
Foul owl on the prowl.
