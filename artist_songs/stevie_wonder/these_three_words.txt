When was the last time 
That they heard you say 
Mother or father, I love you 
And when was the last time 
That they heard you say 
Daughter or son, I love you 

Ones you say you cherish everyday 
Can instantly be taken away 
Then you'd say I know this can't be true 
When you never took the time 
To simply tell them "I love you" 

When was the last time 
That they heard you say 
Sister or brother, I love you 
And when was the last time 
That they heard you say 
Darling or best friend, I love you 

The one for whom you'd give your very life 
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye 
Through you tears you'd ask why did you go 
Knowing you didn't always show 
Just how much you loved them so

These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all

These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside
