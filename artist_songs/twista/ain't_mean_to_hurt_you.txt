[Intro:]
Real shit, I am who I am, future
I'm addicted to money, I'm addicted to women, hey
You my number one no matter what though, hey

[Chorus:]
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you babe
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I shouldn't have lie to you, I know, I know, I know
I din't even wanna say bye to you
You know your nigga ride babe
I even feel the past babe
I'm gonna get it, yes I will

I ain't mean to hurt you girl
That was never meant to be my intentions
I ain't do it on purpose girl
I just had to take a while to handle my bizness
No more neglecting girl
You my best friend and you know how we do
Tripping on me cause I'm in another city
But when I come back home, baby I wanna see you
I could cop that Gucci you still say that ain't enough
I could give you money for your hair and your nails
Just still tripping start acting up
Why you think I'm lying? I'm on the radio, fuck the rumors
Sick of hearding you a pitiful maneuvers
The one I make you say where didy go to...
I just gotta go and do a video with Future
I know it's hard to forgive and forget
About the time that you saw me with a girl in the car
You think I'm fucking everybody
But I be on the grind when I be up in the world
I'm a star, I want you to be a part of my astrology
Cause I had to learn that you was a part of me
So I hope you accept my apology,
So I wanna say, baby I'm sorry

[Chorus:]
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you babe
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I shouldn't have lie to you,
I din't even wanna say bye to you
You know your nigga ride babe
I even feel the past babe
I'm gonna get it, yes I will

Whoa, I play them speakers
People we develop hear my voice
Ain't even see my face
I'm on the paper chase
I got you round my chase,
I got you in my plans
I let you blow them bands
You my biggest fan
When them thang I did
You were just like my twin
When I'm lying to you
It's like I'm lying to my friends
You ain't gonna never leave
It ain't what I tell myself
No matter how much I fucked up
I got your back to deal
What is love with a nigga with a heart of steel
Ain't got no trust for no hoe
That's how I live
When it's bout the crib
And got an extra condo
I couldn't tell you bout the stripper
That was going psycho

[Chorus: x2]
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I ain't mean to hurt you babe
I ain't mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl
I shouldn't have lie to you,
I din't even wanna say bye to you
You know your nigga ride babe
I even feel the past babe
I'm gonna get it, yes I will.
