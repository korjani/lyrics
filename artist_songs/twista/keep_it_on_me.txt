[Hook x2:]
Everywhere I go, know I keep it on me 
Keep it on me, I don't fuck broke niggas 
Only bosses only, bosses only 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions 

[Verse 1 - Twista:]
You know that the Twista higher than a flight attendant 
Got some niggas that'll take you out you die on my decision 
My niggas shoot at weddings, funerals 
Catch you at the [?]
I'm still legendary and idle with it 
When it comes to this rap, I'm crafty and vital with it 
Still on that bullshit like Scotty Pippen and Michael did it 
If it's not it's a fact it get critical, no survival with it 
I don't hang with broke niggas I don't do the diss records 
Or walk up approach niggas, semi in the range, I'm liable to smoke niggas 
In the chi got the power, they call me the ghost nigga 
[?] send him to go get him 
Expedition so you can't get rid of me hoe nigga 
Come with me he got the breeze, the lords, and the folks with him 
Send him off and I'm a bring a ending to your nigga 

[Hook:]
Everywhere I go, know I keep it on me 
Keep it on me, I don't fuck broke niggas 
Only bosses only, bosses only 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions 

[Verse 2 - Twista:]
Everywhere that I go you know I gotta keep it on me 
Married to money and you know I did in to holy matrimony 
And I'm a never leave the crib without a strapper for me
Chicago niggas will catch you lacking, keep it ratchet homie 
You really ain't getting money so stop the acting homie 
And please believe, if we beefing, I'm 'bout that action homie 
Catch your bitch in my show and know that I'm smashing homie 
I'm gonna get money until the day they close the casket on me
I don't hang with broke niggas I don't do the diss records 
Or walk up approach niggas 
What's all that shit you was talking before nigga 
Before I turn your ass into a ghost nigga 
Bitch I'm part of the mob, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga 
Money long I be paid, I be ducking these gold diggers 
Come with me he got the breeze, the lords, and the folks with him 
Better hide the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost with him 

[Hook x2:]
Everywhere I go, know I keep it on me 
Keep it on me, I don't fuck broke niggas 
Only bosses only, bosses only 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions 
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions
