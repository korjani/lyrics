[Twista:]
Smoking on dope as I if was Stephen Marley
Backwoods, the trace for the herb like smoking words
The thought is intensified by me getting high
Off of sativas and indicas I'm finna vibe and I'm finna ride (well)
If it ain't good then he ain't me
The THC levels up in my cannabis manages
To take me to another dimension and mention a way
To the planet just how me turn into an intricate analyst (yeah)
Feeling so over the [?], Alexander
The Great face and I can't wait
To see the niggas that wanna hate so they can take the pull
Or what I be smoking on to get 'em up into my mental state (right)
I'm getting money doing it together whatever
Difference is it you could just be put aside for pride
A pimping is game for what is worth I put it into this
And everytime you're feeling venomous you can just take a hit of this (woo)
Rockily I can be selling a nigga for I'ma no money
But I'ma be tripping 'cause I can get it so I kick it to smoking with you (yeah)
Break a Triple A pound down on the table with you (yeah)
Fucking with you, confetti with you, if I'm able with you (yeah)
Platinum girls got cookies on the honey wood (what)
Grandaddy Kush I'ma show you my money good (what)
We can make it about the hood shit
Supa come and tell 'em what's good
