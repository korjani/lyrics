Let us formally introduce ourselves
Getting money game
The number one co-signer in the game, Don Cannon
Extreme customs
And our homie Twista
Back pop poggle with the man in the hood
We reloaded

Yes yes, y’all, you don’t stop

I’m Twista bitch
I’m on some different shit
Man west side merciful, call me magnificent
I’m back off, my clique strong
Lost her iPhone, she’s back to the brick phone
Sway troop, joggin’ suit with the dookie roll
Coffee cup, countin’ money like I’m Flookie Stokes
I’m on the hustle, paper player and daily profits
Raccoon rat with the tail, call me Davie Crocket
I’m old school, I’m so cool
Bring all my fingers, go across all 4 fool
Takin’ it back to gold nugget John
From a Chevy Malibu to a Cherokee
To a ally ah ah ride to west side
Never picking up the pace
EP I be swag and I fit it to the bass
Mad ‘cause in bigamy 8
Couldn’t happen to a rapper so a nigga couldn’t hate
I remember when the walls had graffiti on it
Took a look at them next summer, now they got GD on ‘em

(Yes yes, y’all, you don’t stop)
I fuck ‘er first and hustle up and hit the weakest spot
(Yes yes, y’all, you don’t stop)
Now flip your work and double up and go arrika

I get street money money street money money money
I’m old school, I’m old school
I get rack money money rack money money money
I’m old school, I’m old school

I’m back on, my money very long
Never TD on the 3 inch, thick hair and bone
Slang bow, slang dope
The way your gang go
I’m paid in full bitch, check out my hurricane go
Remember when you used to get it for the dirty, for the both?
Every rapper in the game or the industry could get over 30 for the show?
‘Cause it was all good when we was on 30’s and vobes
None of these niggas out here pay over 30 for those
Damn, let’s take it back
Who can you tell? Got him
Pop blockin’, my true religions look like bail bonds
Let’s get back to when you used to get work cheap
If you the man, you could still get a third cheap
I’m so old school but I smoke dro fool
Ain’t no mo, we the realest, logic in pro tubes
I’m too old fashion for you to try to play me hater
Antenna on the TV, close on the radiator

(Yes yes, y’all, you don’t stop)
I fuck ‘er first and hustle up and hit the weakest spot
(Yes yes, y’all, you don’t stop)
Now flip your work and double up and go arrika

I get street money money street money money money
I’m old school, I’m old school
I get rack money money rack money money money
I’m old school, I’m old school
