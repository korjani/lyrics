[Verse 1 (Twista)]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks,
Knowing the cops is hot when I’m on the block, And I
Wish my brother would've made bail,
So I won’t have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn’t sick,
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn’t have to suffer,
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone,
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly,
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish my homie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride, And I (I wish)
Wish God could protect us from the wrong
So that all the soldiers that were sent over seas come home and, uh,
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain’t gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on!!!
Let’s HOPE!

[Chorus (Faith Evans)]
Cause I’m hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he’ll make a way
I know it ain’t easy but that’s okay.
cause we hopeful

[Verse 2 (Twista)]
I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hating so much when you see some other people coming up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have ‘em tripping off the joy I bring,
I wish that we can hold hands,
Listen instead of dissing lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that’s on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don’t nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain’ strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish we could never get the blues,
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doing the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game,
Let’s HOPE

[Chorus (Faith Evans)]
Cause I’m hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he’ll make a way
I know it ain’t easy but that’s okay.
cause we hopeful

[Verse 3 (Twista)]
Wish the earth wasn’t so apocalyptic,
I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it,
We can make it, always be optimistic,
If you don’t listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it,
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country never even went to war
Why can’t we kick it and just get em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King “Why can’t we all just get along”,
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies,
You can be wrong if it’s you doubting,
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt,
Just let it go and keep praying on your knees at church!!
And let’s HOPE

[Chorus (Faith Evans) X2]
Cause I’m hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he’ll make a way
I know it ain’t easy but that’s okay.
cause we hopeful
