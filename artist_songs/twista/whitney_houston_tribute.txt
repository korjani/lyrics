What? Somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was gettin' better, now it's really just blew aside
I still ain't got over Don Cornelius' suicide
So, where do I start it? Dearly departed
One of Heaven's angels for sure, who was really an artist
Lovin' the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical
Ain't nobody like you, nobody before you and nobody after you
Could ever come near it, not here in the flesh but you with us in spirit
So sad to hear it, I'm choking up while I come up with these lyrics
And though she blessed the Earth and it's time to let Heaven prosper
I still wish somebody was there to protect her,
(Who?) Kevin Costner (Who?) Clive Davis, (Who?) Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter, Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time, don't want it to be this way
But if she was here, she would probably say:

"If I should stay, I would only be in your way"

If you wanna say rest in peace to Whitney Houston
I had Traxter leave 16 bars open on this song..
So that you could do so with me
So get your verses ready, hop on the track with me
Pay a tribute to the late great Whitney Houston
