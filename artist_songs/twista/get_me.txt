[Verse 1]
On a rainy dark early morn, 
A lethal legacy was born, 
Ask any rapper around 
Bout the fuckin mics I left torn 
But the game won't give me all my P's 
And I wont leave the chi to get G's 
Got love for my mc's at home 
But some of them still hate on me 
Look how many years I done repped 
Hustle thru the streets in the Go 
Inspired by the first rappers ever 
Signed a contract a decade ago 
Put chi name on records in the east 
Put chi name on records in the west 
Put chi name on records in the south
Bitch how you gone open yo mouth 
To the mutha fuckin industry 
Why you hate on me and my city 
Will it be an imbalance of power if yall let chi niggas get G's 
Or I it us holdin us back 
Think hard when you rollin yo sack 
Whatever the case my chi nigga 
If it's in my means I got yo back 
What the fucks really going on 
Does a man bite cause he knows he on 
Don't he know I 'v already established myself as Twista Coleone 
Well I'm holdin my city down 
Aint going nowhere here I stand 
You know where I'm at if you hate me 
If you want me 
Here I am

[Chorus]
Here I am, [4x]
Come and get Me [2x]

[Verse 2]
Tell me what did I do to deserve 
All of this madness around me found me in the studio burying myself in work smoking herb 
Tried to kick me to the curb 
To the back 
To the ditch 
To the dump 
To the shack 
But I sprint 
To the front 
In a llac 
With a fifth and a blunt 
And I'm back 
In the bitch wit a pump 
And I'm ready to bust at you hoes 
Ready to dump lames in ditches 
Steady makin fakers bleed 
LB family handle business 
Come and enter Twista's realm 
Journey wit me thru the pain 
The hurt just might make you envision drama that can turn you insane 
How much of my chaos bring tears 
How many threaten my career 
How many threatin to murder me but bitch you know where I live 
Who the fuck you think I is 
Yall aint comin at no lil shawty 
Why you think you can hurt like these years 
Joe why my lil P's got you salty 
Think you finna bring out my fears 
Tell me why my success 
Make you cry and why my downfalls make you laugh 
I bet my hydro got you high 
Never let hate back me down 
Stand firm like a man 
If you want me 
Wanna kill me 
Here I am

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We got geo like neo and of course we as saucy as Morpheus 
Or we as sick as sir Marcus aralias alias atheist 
Against niggas who flow be the achiest 
Against a aliens and why they hate me is maybe is cause I'm controlling this radius 
Of this world and this whole universe 
Don't believe let me spit you a verse 
And just when you think you the worst 
I come wit words that make you disperse 
My allies know I'm too cold 
My enemies know I spit fast 
My lords know I 'll bust that thang 
My gangsta's know I'll whoop some ass 
Mobster family steady ride 
LB family steady click 
When us and other crews collide 
Choose ya weapon take a pick 
Load up 
Click clack 
It's on finna bust, get back 
Run home come at me bogus get whacked wit a strap 
To the back, of the dome 
Industry niggas get gone 
Heard yall be speakin big words 
I'll show you some shit that a blow you down 
Slow you down 
Like you sip syrup 
For chi sacrificial lamb 
Right here I stand firm 
If you want me 
Here I am

[Chorus]
