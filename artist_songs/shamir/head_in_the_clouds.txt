Got nothing left to lose
Just wanna make my legs move
With all these worries on my back
And that's where they'll stay til I'm in the black Cadillac
Can't waste no time
Just wanna take this moment it's mine
And leave the past behind
Just wanna be great
If that's a joke I've

Got my head in the clouds
And I'm never coming down
Got my head in the clouds
And I'm never coming down

Just wanna see my name
Somewhere in the Hall of Fame
So on the day that I die
There'll be something to remember me by

It's my own right of age
Don't need help
Don't need to be saved
I'd rather drown alone
And make the ocean my own

Got my head in the clouds
And I'm never coming down
Got my head in the clouds
And I'm never coming down
