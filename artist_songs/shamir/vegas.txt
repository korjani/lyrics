Fantasy meets reality
Dancing lies won't let you barely breathe
Energies, ignite like kerosene
Electric means guaranteed to reach a peak

Best believe this city has just what you need
Come and play, there's no place you would rather be...oh

Than Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night
Than Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night

Wildest dreams take on new meaning
Roaming guys waiting for a destiny
Symphonies, ka-ching, ka-ching, endlessly
Pick and choose secrets never leave the scene

Best believe this city has just what you need
Come and play, there's no place you would rather be...oh

Than Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night
Than Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night

Best believe this city has just what you need
Come and play, there's no place you would rather be...oh

You can come to the city of sin and get away without bail
But if you're living in the city oh you already in hell

Cuz it's Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night
Oh in Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas
The city's alright
At least at night [x3]
The city's alright
At least at night
