Sometimes a man [x4]

You would’ve known I do in the rapture
There was no way to move any faster
Because we stay stuck in one place with nothing to do
And sometimes the sediment is true

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

We celebrate the birth on winter’s pattern
While really rising Earth to Saturn's power
And we are slaves trapped inside our own fears
So misbehave and suffer when we’re dead
We’re just infected without a cure

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

Sometimes a man is just a man
Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is [x2]

Don’t leave me hanging on [x3]
Don’t leave me hanging today

I don’t want to be left behind
Everyone’s the same
God don’t play favorites, right?

Who knows what to believe in anymore? [x2]

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

Don’t leave me hanging on [x7]
