once upon a time a child heard a line
that moved him
the child never grew the line it came true
and all around
inside dreams it stays
dormant through these days
that follow
reminded only by the saddest lullaby
that was whispered

you've got to lie down for a while
this will pass its only mild
you've got to ease your mind
for a while

i know ill never be able to be free
from these memories
have love in life the same
embrace it every day
that it comes to you

you've got to lie down for a while
this will pass its only mild
you've got to ease your mind
you've got to ease your mind for a while
lie down for a while
this will pass its only mild
you've got to ease your mind for a while
only for a while
only for a while
only for a while
