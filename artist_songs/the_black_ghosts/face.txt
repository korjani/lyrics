Don't look now
Cause it is coming for you, it is coming for you
Don't slow down
It is around the corner, around the corner
Don't hold back
You got to give what you got, give what you got
You got to face the music, face the music,
Face the music, face the music…

No use hiding
Cause it will break down the door, it will come through the wall
No good fighting
Cause it is stronger than violence and harder than silence
No use lying
Cause it will find the truth inside of you
No good crying
You got to face the music, face the music,
Face the music, face the music…

Don't look now
Cause it is coming for you, it is coming for you
Don't slow down
It is around the corner, around the corner
Don't hold back
You got to give what you got, give what you got
You got to face the music, face the music,
Face the music, face the music…
