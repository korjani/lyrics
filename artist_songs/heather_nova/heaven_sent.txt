Got the lights down low, the street below
The world inside is spinning
All my memories, my doubts about the ways that I've been living
You come on like the sun
And blow it all away

And I guess, heaven sent you, cause I'm heaven high
And I'm heading into what I can't describe
It's all I ever wanted, but I'm terrified
You're in my head, in my veins, in my world
And you're here to stay

Every day I wake, I hesitate
I feel you're in my sky
All my melodies, my dreams it seems
You're always on my mind
If you come on like a tide you turn me
And I can't turn away

I guess, heaven sent you, cause I'm heaven high
And I'm heading into what I can't describe
You're all I ever wanted, but I'm terrified
In my head, in my veins, in my world
And you're here to stay

I guess, heaven sent you, cause I'm heaven high
And I'm heading into, what I can't describe
You're all I ever wanted, but I'm terrified
In my head
Heaven sent you, cause I'm heaven high
Heading into, what I can't describe
You're all I ever wanted, but I'm terrified
In my head, in my veins, in my world, yeah
In my head, in my veins, in my world, yeah
In my head, in my veins, in my world
And you're here to stay
