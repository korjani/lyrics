Kiss me, Kiss me, under a glow-star sky;
If they're stuck on the ceiling I don't mind.
It's a brittle world but it's soft inside
I'll make the milky way for you, only you
You, only you.

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.

Love me, love me, under a glow-star sky,
It's a galaxy when we get high
And sleep to the junkies' lullabies;
I close my eyes for you, only you
You, only you.

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.

I touch your face, I'm flying over fields,
I touch this moment - it's mine.
I'm an angel, I'm a parasite,
I'm a vessel - I shine.

Kiss me, kiss me under a glow-star sky,
We'll be digging up soil someday, sometime,
So hold me now, hold me tight,
I'll make the milky way for you, only you,
You, only you.

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.
