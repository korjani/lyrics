Lately I've been slipping down
Thinking I'm the only one
Drifting in and out of blue
But destiny's a state of mind
And today I'm doing fine
Just rolling through the afternoon with you

[chorus]
And it's a widescreen world around me
And I'm lying on the backseat of my mind
And it's a widescreen, got you beside me
We're just riding on the backseat feeling fine

I will be your misfit queen
I'll take you where the grass is green
Past the littered sidewalk to the sun
I hear the traffic move outside
Yeah but if I close my eyes
I can make it sound like waves rolling on

And it's a widescreen world around me
And I'm lying on the backseat of my mind
And it's a widescreen, got you beside me
We're just riding on the backseat feeling fine

And if we lie still can you feel the room
Can you feel the city, can you feel it move?
Can you tell your body, your body from mine?
Can you la la la lie

[chorus]
