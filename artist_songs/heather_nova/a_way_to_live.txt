If we can't find a way to live
It's that we don't know how to give
We're breathing but with iron lungs
Speaking but in separate tongues

Just find a way, a way to live

The walls are high but made of glass
The dye is dark but not yet cast
And though remorse comes easily
An act of love could set you free

Just find a way, a way to live

A way to live a way to live a way to hold our fire
A way to live a way to live a way to take it higher
