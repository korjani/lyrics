I saw a mountain from higher above.
I held your hand and I was doubled up in love.

Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love.

You're watching your step but you fall as you're walking.
You take it in stride but still you fall as you're walking.

Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love.

Feels good, it feels like poetry,
Don't ask me to explain it just feels good, like poetry,
I'm doubled up again.

Look at the sky,
Lift off like an aeroplane,
Watch the ground come up to meet you.

Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love.

Feels good, it feels like poetry,
Don't ask me to explain it just feels good, like poetry,
I'm doubled up again.
