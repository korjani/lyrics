Fall for me, my southern cross, my star
Shine for me when love has gone too far
I've got you belly deep in me

Just a little breath on the water is all we need
Just a little strength in our hearts
Enough to heal
Enough to heal

Dig me out, can't leave this love for dead
Hand to mouth we're picking up the thread
I've got you belly deep in me

Just a little breath on the water now is all we need
Just a little strength in our hearts
Enough to heal
Enough to heal

And the sea glistens
And the waves pull us in
There's something rising up and up

Just a little breath on the water now
Just a little strength in our hearts,
Enough to heal
Enough to heal.
