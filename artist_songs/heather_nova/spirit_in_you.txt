Under your skin there's something beckoning;
There's something that makes me believe in you.
Behind your eyes, that's where the sacred lies;
You know I need to get through.

Oh here I go again.
Through the undergrowth again;
Feel the earth move, the planets spin
But I can't get through.

It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
That I want to find.

I've seen your face, the one your mother made.
Now let me see what makes you really move.
I know you're scared, I know it's tender there,
Just let me closer let me get through.

Oh here I go again,
Through the undergrowth again,
Feel the earth move, the planets spin
But I can't get through.

It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
That I want to find.

And when you make me feel
When you make me bleed,
My lucky stars fall down on me.
You know I need to know you,
I need to see,
I need to take ahold of what's underneath.
So close your eyes, unlock your mind,
Throw off the fear, and let us fly.

Oh here I go again,
Through the undergrowth again;
Feel the earth move, the planets spin,
But I can't get through.

It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
It's the spirit in you,
That I want to find.
