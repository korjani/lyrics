I've got a ruby red desire
Like a virus like my last hope
I've got a ruby red desire
I've got to hear the red bird sing
I've got to rip this cord
And rinse this lazy blood
Clear a path and walk away

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for the sky to fall
I've been thinking I could lose it all
I've been waiting for the safety net
Tell myself that I'm not ready yet

And every memory's a dream
And each uncertainty reminds me why
I saw a kid outside playing by a moongate
Making paper things that fly

I've been waiting for the sky to fall
I've been worried I could lose it all
I've been waiting for the safety net
Tell myself that I'm not ready yet

I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
