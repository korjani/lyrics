I have slept beside the winter and the green is growing slow
I have watched you find the places hidden by the snow
I have tripped into a valley that is blue till you can see
I want you to come walk this world with me

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on to what we believe
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be
I want you to come walk this world with me

And I'm sucked in by the wonder and I'm fucked up by the lies
And I dig a hole to lie in and I build some wings to fly
And I think that I could love you 'cause you know how to be free
I want you to come walk this world with me

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on 'til we believe
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be
I want you to come, I want you to come
I want you to come walk this world with me

And it's burning in our fingers and it's burning on the road
And I like the way you're broken and I'll like you when you're old
And I see you in the garden and I feel you plant the seed
I want you to come walk this world with me

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on 'til we believe
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be
I want you to come, I want you to come
I want you to come walk this world with me
