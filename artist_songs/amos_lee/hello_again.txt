Hello again, 
I know it's been a long time coming 
You say you've been, been now a long time running 

You used to be, so beautiful 
But you lost it somewhere along the way 
You used to be so beautiful 
But it's easy now to walk away 

That wonder wall you're waiting for is now collapsing 
Tell me more, but wait no no 
Let me find out what you're asking for 

You used to be, so beautiful 
But you lost it somewhere along the way 
You used to be so beautiful 
And it's easy now to walk away 
Away, away 

Now you have everything you have ever wanted 
Oh it's so sad to see 
When the hunter becomes the hunted 

You used to be, so beautiful 
But you lost it somewhere along the way 
You used to be so beautiful 
And I'm sorry now I don't have nothing more to say
