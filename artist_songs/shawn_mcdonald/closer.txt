[Verse 1]
Looking for a color
In a shade of gray,
Looking for love
In a drop of rain.
Trying to change from
The old mundane.
Everything i do just
Feels the same.
Spending my life
Out of the desert.
Been gone so long
Feels like forever.

[Chorus]
I just want to be
Even closer to you.
I just want to
Be even closer.
I am yours.
You can have all of me,
Anything, everything.
I just want to
Be even closer.

[Verse 2]
A day without you
Is a thousand years.
A day without you
Is a million tears.
Tell me why do
I run in fear?
Why do i run when
You are so near?
Spending my life
In the weather.
Been gone so long and
I need some shelter.

[Chorus]
I just want to be
Even closer to you.
I just want to
Be even closer.
I am yours.
You can have all of me,
Anything, everything.
I just want to
Be even closer.

[Bridge]
Wherever you go,
Wherever you are,
I just want to be
There with you.

[Chorus]
I just want to be
Even closer to you.
I just want to
Be even closer.
I am yours.
You can have all of me,
Anything, everything.
I just want to
Be even closer.

[Outro]
Looking for a color
In a shade of gray,
Looking for love
In a drop of rain.
