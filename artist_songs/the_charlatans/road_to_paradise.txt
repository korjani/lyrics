Is this the road to Paradise?
Always to feel it's all over
There must be something going on inside
Security walls, they better be tight
There will be no free kind of advice
Lost in career, lost in the night

I don't want to blame this on each other
But everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go
There will be no tears on my pillow
For everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go, I watch the river flow

This is the road to Paradise
Always to feel it's all over
Born on the 4th of July
Born under strange, strange skies
There will be no free kind of advice
Security walls, you better be tight

I don't want to blame this on each other
But everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go
There will be no tears on my pillow
For everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go, I watch the river flow

This is the road to Paradise
This is the road to Paradise

I don't want to blame this on each other
But everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go
I don't want to blame this on each other
But everywhere I go, I watch the river flow
No matter where I go
