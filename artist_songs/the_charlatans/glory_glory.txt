The wedding told a secret
A tremble in her hand
Too young to be together
Too young to understand

And we all sang
Glory Glory
Hallelujah

I wish that I could have told her
I wish that I loved her more

Now there's nothing to stop you leaving
No one to keep you here
It's time to start with the healing
With someone else who should care

And then we all sang
Glory Glory
Hallelujah
Glory Glory
Hallelujah
