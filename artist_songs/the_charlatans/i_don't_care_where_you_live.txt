Here I stand at the foot of the window
Oh! please I can help you fill the hole
All my life I depend on opinion
You have solid soul

I don't care where you live
I don't care where you live
For today, I started loving you again
Here I stand at the foot of the window
Oh please I don't care where you live
Tell me why, and please be kind
My only companion

I don't care where you live
I don't care where you live
I will follow you
Wherever you
Wish to be
I will follow you, wherever you
I will follow you, wherever you
I will follow you, wherever you

Wait with me
As our love is for keeping
Lord I can help you fill the hole
My my my your daddy cares
He's just not here today
It goes on

I don't care where you live
I don't care where you live
For today, I started loving you again
