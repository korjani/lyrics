A boy with a stronger emotion, has nothing on me I've got this one
Going round round round this sensation I found in my soul
Love as it touches perfection, a balance of truth and correction
Going round round round this sensation I found again

Station to station, this sensation, a celebration
I won

Speculation reassures your opinion to presume you are the answer division
Going round round round this sensation I found in my soul
This hated body's persuasion, on any level of the organisation
Going round round round this sensation I found again

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Station to station, this sensation, a celebration
I won

A stranger in awe of the chaos in reality he never could save us
Going round round round this sensation I found in my soul
Again, again, again, again this sensation
I fucking won
