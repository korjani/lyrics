Tell everyone, 
Don't put it on, 
It makes no difference to me, 
Won't mess around, 
Been here too long. 
It makes no difference when you smile, 
'Cause I don't run from love, 
From anyone. 
And I could land on money or the moon, 
On hillside straights, 
Can't walk its late, 
I know there's something left alive. 
No I don't take no shit from anyone, 
And I could land on money or the moon, 
You know the sun will come soon and we can sail away...
Tell everyone, don't put it on, 
It makes no difference to me, 
'Cause I don't run from love, 
From anyone, 
And I could land on money or the moon, 
You know the sun will come soon,
And you will see, 
You're still there, 4 me.
