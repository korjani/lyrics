I too feel the plastic machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So let's just run, even if only in our heads
Leave all of this behind, unless we could stand still

It's not that we have no interest
It's not that we don't think it's worth it
Oh wait, I'm such an idiot
My shoulders find this hard to take it

You can't tell me, tonight if not this time
Your thoughts don't need, don't need to be combined

I feel it too
This broken world
There is no second chance
Our bags unfold

Don't be part of the machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So let's just run, even if only in our heads
Leave all of this behind, unless we could stand still
Oh this machine, still working in our heads
Oh this machine, still working in our heads
