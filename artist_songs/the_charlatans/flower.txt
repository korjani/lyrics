Don't bring me flowers to my bed
I don't wish you to know
It's time to find myself again

As cold as houses on your street
As hollow as my own
I hope you wish them all away

Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl

Don't bring me flower to my bed
She got what she deserved
I told her I am of my time

As cold as houses on my street
As hollow as my own
I hope you wish them all away

Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl

Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
