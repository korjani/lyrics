When you're low
And I'm feeling awry
And it's time to say goodnight
When you finally lay your soul to rest
I'll be falling asleep on an empty street

No matter how you're feeling
You know you're never on your own

Hear the bells ring in the morning
When you crawl back from the church
All the buildings go up to the sky
All the people goin' down to the ground

No matter how you're feeling
You know you're never on your own

And your boss is quietly hounding

As he creeps into your sleep
No voice or poet's pen can touch what
Hits you in the morning

It don't matter how you're feeling
You know you're never on your own
You don't even have to answer the phone

Ain't nobody
Talkin' me down
I will destroy you
I've shown my soul
Come on

Ain't nobody
Listening to you
I'll be your eyes your ears
Get on it
