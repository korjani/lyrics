Try not to die
Try not to die
Hold me tight
I know there's something going wrong inside

Tonight tonight
The stars are bright
Watch me close
Because I'm looking for the last laugh

For your entertainment

I know you lie
I know you lie
Looking for the boys
With the needles in their eyes

Hold me close
For the first kiss
I guess I'm looking
For something that just don't exist

For your entertainment
