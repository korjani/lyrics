The only one I know
Has come to take me away
The only one I know
Is mine when she stitches me

The only one I see
Has found and aching in me
The only one I see
Has turned her tongue into me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

The only one I know
Never cries, never opens her eyes
The only one I know
Wide awake and then she's away

The only one I see
Is mine when she walks down our street
The only one I see
Has carved her way into me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
