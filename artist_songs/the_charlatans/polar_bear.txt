World's no place to love in
She doesn't know what day it is
Freezing to death with no clothes on
Do you know what you are

It took me ages to find my way home
Give me a lead to hold on to
It's alright for you, she said faintly
You gave it away

I've never had one of those

Change of scene
Is all I need to breathe again
As soon as I thought it was over
It started again

I've never had one of those

Life's a bag of Revels
And I'm looking for the orange one
She's gone
And not for the first time

I've never had one of those

World's no place to love in
She doesn't know what day it is
Have you seen my polar bear
It's that white thing over there

I've never had one of those

How many ways, how many ways
How many ways do you fall before you're shot down?
How many ways, how many ways
How many ways, do you know?
