Hey country boy
Hey country boy
What are you sad about
Everyday you make the sun come out
Even in the pouring rain
I'll come to see you
And I'll save you, I'll save you

What do you care about
And she said "this and that"
What do I mean to you
I'll show you if you want the truth
I can't remember
I don't know how to tell you
But I love you just the same

How many eyes
Must a young girl have
I know she makes you cry
I know she makes you laugh
I'll be good to you if I could I'd make you happy
If I had a son I'd be good to my daddy
Who loves you though I bet it's not the same
As your north country boy

Hey country boy
What are you sad about
I think we'll work it out
Even in the morning rain
He'll come to see you
Hope your feelings are the same

How many ears must a young girl have
I know she hears you cry
I know she hears you laugh
Itchy and Scratchy come runnin' up the alley
If you'll be good I'll be good to your daddy
Who loves you but I bet it's not the same
As your north country boy

What do you care about
And she said "this and that"
What do I mean to you
I'll show you if you want the truth
I threw it all away
I don't know where I put it
But I miss it all the same

How many eyes must a young girl have
I know she makes you cry
I know she makes you laugh
I'll be good to you if I could I'd make you happy
If I had a son I'd be good to my daddy
Who loves you but I bet it's not the same
As your north country boy
