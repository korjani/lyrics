Here's to the man who gives to the poor
With a hole in his pride you know
He only wants to give more
Here's to the man who feels for the weak
The moral of this story is
You can never have too much, too late
Perhaps I need you
More than I appreciate you

We all feel a little danger 
When there's something in the air
We all feel a little hunger
When there's nothing to care about
Perhaps I need you
More than you need me

Here's to the man who deals with his life
Who is not insecure and will
Always try to do right
Here's to the man who feels for the weak
The moral of this story is
You can never have too much, too late
Perhaps I need you
More than I appreciate you
I don't know why you treat me like you do
You continuously break my heart
When you say I don't understand you

We all feel a little danger 
When there's something in the air
We all feel a little hunger
When there's something to care about
Sayin' something, sayin' nothing
You will be a little quieter with a gun in your mouth
I am facing north and you're still facing south
Perhaps I need you
More than you need me
