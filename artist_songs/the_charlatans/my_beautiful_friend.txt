My beautiful friend
I will pay attention don't say this is the end
I find it hard to describe you
To point and discover you
Could I tell you once again

Ah-oh Ah-oh
My beautiful friend

Let me sleep and I will feed you when you're hungry
Forever live inside of me
Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes
High, as high as an angel
I will stand there beside you
Love is all we need

Ah-oh ah-oh
My my my beautiful friend
Ah-oh ah-oh
My my my beautiful friend

My beautiful friend
I swear I adore you
Ain't no woman deep enough
I don't know how we made it this far dear
Without losing at least an ear
I could leave us, I could leave us a painting
Our lives are-a-changing

I couldn't and I wouldn't want to change you
Don't you know it I can save you
I will do all of this on my very own

Ah-oh ah-oh
My my my beautiful friend
Ah-oh ah-oh
My my my beautiful friend

My beautiful friend

Do you ever get this feeling
When it's hard to carry on
Do you ever get this feeling
When it's hard to carry on
Do you ever get this feeling
When it's hard to carry on
