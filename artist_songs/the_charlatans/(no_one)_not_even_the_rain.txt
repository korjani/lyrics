The first and lonely days have come
A sea of state
And a heaven unknown
And I don't like the air that I breathe
It can't escape from me

I don't belong to this world no more to
Better myself why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again why don't you
Save me again I can't do anything

Not even the rain has such small hands
Another kick my soul can't stand
And I don't like the air that I breathe
And I don't like the air that I breathe
It can't escape from me

I don't belong to this world no more to
Better myself why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again why don't you
Save me again I can't do anything

When honesty is mine to ride
A gem dissolving shadowslide
Down you better not drown
What are you going to do when the sky
Falls out of this world

I don't belong to this world no more to
Better myself why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again why don't you
Save me again I can't do anything

I don't belong to this world no more to
Better myself why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again why don't you
Save me again I can't do anything
