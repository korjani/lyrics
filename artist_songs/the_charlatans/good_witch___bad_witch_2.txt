I'm goin' where the good wind blows
I'm goin' where the good wind blows
I'm goin' where the good wind blows

Goin' where the good wind blows blows blows blows

I'm on the bad bad side of the road
I'm on the bad bad side of the road
You know you're goin' where the good wind blows
I'm on the bad bad side of the road
