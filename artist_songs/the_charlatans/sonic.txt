Illustrate and beautify
This one time painting is sinking so fast
What you need is someone like me
These weeks are too long
You're drifting too far out

I know where this one belongs
There's truth in all I see
I don't know where money goes
Think about it

I know some things are better left
To die in a coma along with the builders
What you need is someone like me
I can throw out what's buried inside here

I know where this one belongs
There's truth in all I see
I don't know where money goes
Think about it

I know some things are better left
To die in a coma along with the builders
What you need is someone like me
I can throw out what's buried inside here

I know where this one belongs
There's truth in all I see
I don't know where money goes
Think about it

Think about it
Think about it
Think about it
