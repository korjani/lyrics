Drummer boy
Heavens deaf, drummer boy
Heavy metal band sing with me
Deep sleep, we can march to the beat
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Put the move on beat
Let the other ones stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the head on the street
Let the enemy sing with me

Ohhhh

Bomb heaven 
Can they bomb heaven in
Heavy metal band fall with me
Bomb heaven
They can bomb heaven in
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Heavens deaf, drummer boy 
Heavy metal band stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the heat on the street
Let the enemy sing with me

Ohhh
