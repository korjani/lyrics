Rachel, please, don't go to the beach
Don't go

Rachel, please, please stay here with me
Sighing

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh
(Oooh) Suddenly
I land by the sea
Dead leaves
Rinsing fish, we cry in our sleep
Lightly

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh 
Oh-oh-oooh oh oh oh-oh-oooh
Oooh oooh

Oh-oh-oooh oh oh oh-oh-oooh
Oooh oooh
