I feel like I'm standing on a mountain
Where everyone can see me
In the worst way
All of these eyes on me expecting
But I can't find a thing to say

Headlights
Casting my shadow
On the clouds behind me
The dark in all that define me
In all that blinding confusion
How did I ever find you?

In a life of second guessing
I knew at first glance
I would let you in
In the emotion of the moment
I gave myself to chance
Thought of where we go
Not of where I've been

Headlights
I'm weak and I'm hallow
With the weight of my own head
Too heavy on my bones
Headlights
I'm eager to follow
So many things unsaid
And so much still unknown
Headlights
Clearing the shadow
On the clouds behind me
I'm free for you to define me
Nothing else in my vision
How did I ever lose you?

I was living such a vacant life
Then I thought that I had it right this time
As fast as a fool can fall
I'm trapped back in these same four walls
I was living such a lonely life
And then I thought that it all come right this time
As fast as a fool can fall
Drive back in these same four walls

Headlights
Casting my shadow
On the clouds behind me
The dark in all that define me
In all that blind and confusion
How did I ever find you?
Headlights
Clearing the shadow
On the clouds behind me
I'm free for you to define me
With nothing else in my vision
How did I ever lose you?

I was living such a vacant life
Then I thought that I had it right this time
As fast as a fool can fall
Trapped back in these same four walls
I was living such a lonely life
Then I thought that it all come right this time
As fast as a fool can fall
Drive back in these same four walls
