I've been jumping from the tops of buildings.
For the thrill of the fall. 
Ignoring sound advice
And any thought of consequence.
My bones are shattered.
My pride is shattered.
And in the midst of
This self-inflicting pain
I can see my beautiful rescue.

I'm falling more in love.
With every single word I withhold.
I'm falling more in love.
With every single word you say.
I'm falling head over heels for you.

I've been dancing on the tops of buildings.
At the top of my lungs I'm singing you a song.
Don't you leave me alone.
My bones were shattered.
My pride lays shattered.
Well I'll trample my pride and tell the whole world.
To dance with me.

I'm falling more in love.
With every single word I withhold.
I'm falling more in love.
With every single word you say.
I'm falling head over heels for you again.

Well, I'm crying out.
"Wash my hands, these bloody hands so open my mouth and I'll sing."

I'm falling more in love.
With every single word I withhold.
I'm falling more in love.
With every single word you say.
I'm falling head over heels for you.

I've been dancing on the tops of buildings with you.
