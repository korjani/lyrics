Hey, this is mine, you listen
Another broken lie
I've really had enough now
Of human parasites
With no more room for honour
Burned and bloody raw
The fuckers and the scumbags
Defended by the law

Who wants their protection
Who will right the day, yeah
Dangerous connections
Who will make them pay

Man A King Ruler
Man A King Ruler

And all the fucking perverts
Who do their dirty worst
A technical decision
Released upon the world
They're greedy with ambition
And seedy little plans
The quest for domination
With dirty evil hands

Who wants their protection
Who will right the day, yeah
Dangerous connections
Who will make them pay

Man A King Ruler...
