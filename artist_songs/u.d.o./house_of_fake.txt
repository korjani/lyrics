You are the bastard that’s behind the mask
You are the lying living proof
You are the bad dog bites the hand
You wouldn’t recognize the truth
I burn you down – to the ground

You are the clown like all the rest
I'd like to flush you down the tube
I smell you like a sewer rat
You’re always fucking up the rules

I burn you down to the ground

We’re living in a house of fake
What you mean
He’s done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

You are the master of the war machine
Evidence is blinded by your truth
So take away this masquerade
You are nothing without us

I burn you down to the ground

We’re living in a house of fake
What you mean
He’s done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

I´m gonna break the spell
And send you right to hell
And take away this fucking chain

It´s time for you to run
Your crimes have been undone
And now the change has just begun

We’re living in a house of fake
What you mean
He’s done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

We’re living we’re living
What you see
In a house of fake
We’re living we’re living
What you see
We’re living we’re living
What you see
In a house of fake
We’re living we’re living
What you see
