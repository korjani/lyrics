I don't wanna be another retro-man
I don't wanna be no part of your plans
I don't wanna be no diamond king
I just wanna pull the detonation pin

I won't give up a life of sin
You'll never tame the beast within
You can't abuse what I've got in here
My animal instinct is what you fear

And I howl - and I prowl
I am a raptor in time
And I howl - and I prowl
I am unbroken - creature of the wild

I've got an animal instinct
I've got an animal instinct

I don't wanna lead nor even dominate
Not a top-dog leader that only devastates
You know I'm free and I stand so proud
My animal anger - I shout it aloud

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Animal - animal - animal - animal - instinct
Animal - animal - animal - animal - instinct

[CHORUS]
