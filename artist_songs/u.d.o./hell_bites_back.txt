Hell bites back
Hell bites back

You'll do the time
And that's a fact
Your lesson has begun

No prison life
Can offer back
You gotta walk the line to come

Now comes the time when the payment is due
Now it's the time to go on

I know that
Hell bites back
Hell bites back

It may be right
It may be wrong
When they close your door

You'll hate the day
And fear the night
You gave the finger to the law

Never surrender - cover your back
Nothing to stop a stab in the back
Never give in - never give out
Better be good - never get out
