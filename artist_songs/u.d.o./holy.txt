Raised from the glowing ashes of cauldron iron
The Phoenix arose from the sanctum of metal
Emerging into the light

So many hard times
So many bad lies
A man of steel
You know I'm real

Ev'rything I do
I'm taking all control - it's my heart
You know it's how I feel
So stick it in your mind - now you're mine

Time - it's time I'm taking over
And crank it up in overdrive
I'll tell you why

You know I'm holy
So fucking holy - raise your hands
You know I'm holy
So fucking holy - pain and pride

So many places
So many aces
I made a curse
I gave you birth

Ah - glorious metal times
The master of our lives - never died
A special kind of force
Together no remorse - you'll be mine

Burning on overload
Legends won't die
No cross - no burdens to control
No asking why

The master never dies
