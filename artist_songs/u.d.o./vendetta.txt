Whisky was forbidden
Money from the hand
Deadly prohibition
Corruptive layerman
Judges in the pockets
Of the families
The east side and the westside
The river stands between

Priests and hitmen
Hail the old god
Money makes you free

It's a vendetta - vendetta
It's a vendetta - vendetta

The Thompson and the casket
The roseries and beads
The head scarved veiling mothers
The grandmas on their knees
The smacking of bambinos
The kissing on the cheek
The meatball and the mincer
Speak-easies on the streets

Money for extortion
The skimming from the top
Godfathers and lieutenants
The massive ruling mob
Easy girls and gambling
Paddy waggon meat
The backroom holy masses
Forgiving dirty deeds
