You sense his picture without a clue
You feel his presence- you think it's true
Somehow we know we have to pay
For all the things we didn't do or say

He is here- calling for you
Don't turn away- get down on your knees and pray
Seven days- seven secrets he had
We can't find out- and that's too bad

We always tried to believe in you
No sign or proof of the truth

We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- he's coming back for you
We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- metal maniac mastermind

We're burning out like a fireball
Leaving just a shell
If you ever gonna let us down
We break apart- so let's hold on

We always tried to believe in you
No sign or proof of the truth

We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- he's coming back for you
We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- seven days- seven secrets he had

And when you hear the voice- you know you got no choice
With no more tears and no more fears- you will never be alone again

He's coming back just for you- who ever thought that he would
You better start to believe it- it's time to let a dream come true

We always tried to believe in you
No sign or proof of the truth

We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- he's coming back for you
We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- don't turn away
No one like you- seven days- seven secrets he had

We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- metal maniac mastermind

You sense his picture without a clue
You feel his presence- you think it's true
He is here- calling for you
Don't turn away- get down on your knees and pray

We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- looking for ya
No one like you- metal maniac mastermind
We pray to you- metal maniac mastermind- don't turn away
No one like you- seven days- seven secrets he had

We pray to you...
