Burning in my heart- burning in my soul
Gotta have it more and more- hot and overloaded
Starving for some fun tonight- always dressed to kill
Don't tell me what I need- I need the thrill indeed

Don't stop me now
I'll run you over- bastard
Get out of my way
I feel mighty great

Burning heat- gets me- burning heat
Burning heat- breaks me- burning heat

Can't you see it coming- stronger than a bull
Get yourself going- you're too easy to beat
Don't forget I'm strong- powerful and straight
I can take you on 'cause I am hard to break

Don't stop me now
I'll run you over- bastard
Get out of my way
I feel mighty great

Burning heat- gets me- burning heat
Burning heat- breaks me- burning heat

Burning heat- gets me- burning heat
Burning heat- breaks me- burning heat
Burning heat- leads me- burning heat
Burning heat- feeds me- burning heat

Burning in my heart- burning in my soul
Gotta have it more and more- hot and overloaded

Burning heat- gets me- burning heat
Burning heat- breaks me- burning heat
Burning heat- leads me- burning heat
Burning heat- feeds me- burning heat
