It’s totally wasted
Let’s bring it down
This road is hectic
I’d rater take my time

We’re going faster than the world should be
It’s going out of control
I’m sick of wasting energy
I need to feed my soul

We got to stop at this station
Jump off this ride
It’s all bad sensations
Don’t apologize

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside

Wasted and senseless
Feet on the ground
You just accept it
Or do you wanna’ drown

Like a bullet blowing up your head
The price of being bad
You better watch your lazy back
Before it drives you mad

We got to stop at this station
Jump off this ride
It’s all bad sensations
Don’t apologize

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside

How you gonna taste it
When all you do is waste it
It’s all for you
All for you
How you gonna make it
When all you do is break it
It’s all for you
All for you

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are crazy in the mind

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cos’ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside
