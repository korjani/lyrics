I wake up feeling lost without you
And the pain reminds me that I'm all alone
Those dreams we had, are now a nightmare
I feel just like a dog without a bone

Now is now and then was then
But I can't get used to being without you

It's a brand-new start and now I know that I should've
But I never ever thought I'd miss your eyes
"say" here we go again

All I need is you tonight
Why don't you call
All I need is you tonight
To catch my fall

I'd die for you over and over again
But I guess you've heard it all before
You say times have changed, changed your ways
But your absence makes me need you more and more

It's a brand-new start and now I know that I should've
Loved you then...

All I need is you tonight
Why don't you call
All I need is you tonight
To catch my fall

All I need is you tonight
Why don't you call
All I need is you tonight
To catch my fall- that's all

[SOLO]

All I need is you tonight...
