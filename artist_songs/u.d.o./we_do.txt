We do - for you
Everything you ask for
We do - for you
Now you're gonna get more

Raging heavy metal
Keeping to the plan
Heaven for the faithful
Hell will claim the damned

A sea of noise and mayhem
Coming to you soon
Beware! - you nonbelievers
You better leave the room

Raise your hands
All across the land
We give to you
'Cause we do what we do - for you

We do - for you
Everything you ask for
We do - for you
Now you're gonna get more

Crazy for the headstrong
Stamping on the ground
Crazy for the thunder
Lock into the sound

An army made forever
Raised across the world
Fight for - what you believe in
Hot rockin' is the word
