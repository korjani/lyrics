So many people tell me what to do
Stay away from me
Don’t need that look you’re giving me
Just stay away

I’ll only warn you once again
Don’t waste my time
This is the line you don’t cross
I will cut – you down

Rolling on
Pay attention – we don’t care
Rolling on
I won’t say these words again

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

You carry on your way I told you, you can keep on walking
All I’m hearing from your mouth is the crap you’re talking

You better go, get off my street
You’re smelling like a bad disease
I know you’ve heard - where I come from
I know what I see – I know it’s wrong

Rolling on
Pay attention – we don’t care
Rolling on
I won’t say these words again

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Untouchable
