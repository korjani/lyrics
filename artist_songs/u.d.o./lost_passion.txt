Welcome hello, please take your seat
We leave now for a trip- in hell
Now we can start especially for you- join us now!

Shattered dreams, in shattered faces
Crawling off the stage
Forgotten heroes lost their passion, many years ago

Time after time in your life
You're burning your world of illusions
Tearing your conscience apart
Lost Passion

Now you can see, you can see what it means
To come to a world of lies, all such lies
Think about your destiny- the love you found
Was it just a dream, just a dream

Shattered dreams, in shattered faces...

Time after time in your life
You're burning your world of illusions
Tearing your conscience apart
Lost Passion- Lost Passion

Time after time in your life
You're burning your world of illusions
Tearing your conscience apart
Lost Passion- Lost Passion- Lost Passion

[SOLO]

Time after time in your life...
