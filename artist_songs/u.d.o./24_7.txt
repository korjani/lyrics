I'm gonna blow your mind
And push you higher
I have my way to find
And nail the liar
You want it cleaner - I make it meaner
Anyway you want
You're gonna squeeze it - you're gonna please it
Always on the hunt
Come on and roll it - so fucking hold it - move your ass
Come on and scream it - we fucking mean it - living fast
You know we live it - 24/7
Twenty-four hours - seven days a week
You know we give it - 24/7
Twenty-four hours - seven days a week
I'm gonna kick you hard
You want disaster
We only take it rough
And tough and faster
You want it cleaner - I make it meaner
Right between the eyes
You're gonna squeeze it - you're gonna please it
Always pay the price
