It slits you up- deep inside
It hits you here right between your eyes
It's somehow evil- red-hot and weird
A dangerous feeling- you never want it
It turns you inside out

Don't know why I can't beat it
It feels like burning steel
It sounds like grinding metal sheets

Metal eater- it always gets you
Metal eater- money eating murder slot machine- metal eater

If you would know- how to stop
But you're hooked to the bandits for your life
And as you see it- it's better than to run
But you're dead wrong- it's gonna kill ya
It's gonna smash you after all

Don't know why I can't beat it
It feels like burning steel
It sounds like grinding metal sheets

Metal eater- it always gets you
Metal eater- money eating murder slot machine- metal eater

Don't know why I can't beat it
It feels like burning steel
It sounds like grinding metal sheets

Metal eater- it always gets you
Metal eater- money eating murder slot machine- metal eater

Metal eater- with a smile it's gonna kill ya
Metal eater- money eating murder slot machine

Metal eater- burning steel- it's somehow evil
Metal eater- no one stops the money eating murder slot machine
