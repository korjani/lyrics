I ate the moon for breakfast
I had the sun for tea
I opened up the papers
And drank the oval sea

I beat the holy armies
I claimed my own terrain
I forced away the darkness
And cauterized my pain

I'll live my dreams - and I'll have it all
All in the day and the night
Time after time - I never go wrong
Watch out - you better hold tight

Ride the thunderball
The thunderball
Ride the thunderball
The thunderball

I walked upon the desert
And scaled the mountains high
Gave water to the rivers
And painted up the sky

I've played with all the planets
Took life away from Mars
And all my magic power
Gave light to all the stars

Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - read the book of lies
Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - the shock of life

Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - do you believe
Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - have the ride of your life

Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - believe in lies
Ride the thunderball
The thunderball - between the lines
