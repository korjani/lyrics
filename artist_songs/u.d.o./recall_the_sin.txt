Many years ago
My heart and soul was full of fire
Breaking heads - hit and run
And the sun was brighter

So wild and reckless
Cared about no law and order
We used to ram - the black and whites
They called a six-one-niner

Those were my glory days
Just bad-boys-crazy-ways
My wild-man-holy-times
I always shot on sight

And I recall the sin
And I recall the sin

In many sleepless nights
I found the dream I'm missing
Kicking ass - living fast
Been living in a prison

Time to change the colours
Sweep away the madness
Here I come - back for good
Say good-bye to sadness
