We're revving up - we're coming through
We're breaking out - just for you
Ripping up - and all that crap
We're gonna make - the better map
So here we are
We're here for good
So listen up
Take our word forever
We're on the move - we're on the ball
We're gonna feed - your hungry soul
No matter who - no matter where
Be it here - or be it there
Breaking down the borders
Breaking all the chains
No more law and order
Breaking down the pain
We're gonna fight - and gonna win
No matter what - we won't give in
It was them - who made the rules
They're the ones - who are the fools
