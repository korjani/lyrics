Thunder roads in action
Horizon's all the same
That's the big attraction
Come on join the game

Brothers out of time
'n' chasing down the line
Mighty eagles rage into the sky

Ride the storm - now and tomorrow
Faster and so far
Ride the storm - no hidden sorrows
'n' aiming for the stars

The colour black's for leather
Metal engines howl
'n' ride the storm together
Tailpipes gonna growl

We ride the iron horses
'n' freedom in the heart
We never will surrender
We are the breed apart
