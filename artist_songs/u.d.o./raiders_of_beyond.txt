Raiders gonna open up the stargate
The planetary call is here to stay
Galactic energy's in all directions
A ticket for a ride on a time machine

Now the gate is open solar wide
Million kingdoms are inside

Raiders of beyond - energize
Raiders of beyond - speed of light
Raiders of beyond - blinding white
Raiders of beyond - blaze eternity

Systematical declining forces
'n' gravity has lost 'n' gone for good
Hypersonic engines scream for mercy
The elements will bear and take the load
