I am redemption
I am the living
I am the death
I am a slaughter
I am your sick
I am your hell

I tried to – be kind
I failed – not nice

You are the victim
I am your cancer
I’m not your cure
I’m your injection
I am the virus
Infect your blood

I tried to – be kind
I failed – not nice

This is the mystery of life
Touch you deep inside
Screaming while you’re deep in pain
Mystery of life
Rip your soul inside
Turning to a - bad beast
Bad beast

I am the shadow
I am your dark
I am the past
I am the feeder
I am your brain
I am the trash

I tried to – be kind
I failed – not nice

This is the mystery of life
Touch you deep inside
Screaming while you’re deep in pain
Mystery of life
Rip your soul inside
Turning to a - bad beast
Bad beast

This is the mystery of life
Touch you deep inside
Screaming while you’re deep in pain
Mystery of life
Rip your soul inside
Turning to a - bad beast
Bad beast
Bad beast
Bad beast
Bad beast
