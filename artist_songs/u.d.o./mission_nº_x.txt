Reporting for the duty
There's fever in our blood
The target is still locked on
No. X has just begun
Raise your arms for rhythm
Join and swell the ranks
Wear the badge with honour
We don't fire blanks
Million tons of passion
Breathing down your backs
Turning on the systems
Power up your packs
Come and join our mission - Mission No. X
Come and join our mission - Mission No. X
The mission is to conquer
We give it in the raw
Never taking prisoners
Defenders of the law
Raise your hands in fire
Standing back to back
Machinery of metal
Code X is the attack
