You always tried to be so nice
But always got it wrong
Day by day you played your games with me
But there's no way you'll win

But the time has come
I'll start another light
And now I'm gonna stand
Stand on my own - I've always been a man

Kick your desperate balls
It's my command the mighty fall
Kick your desperate balls
Received the blow forever tall
You got desperate balls

Double talk and desperate lies
You failed to see and recognize
So sorry for your puny minds
No salvation for your kind

You tried to take me on
For you I'm way too strong
I showed you how to stand
Stand on my own - I'll always be a man

Kick your desperate balls
So watch your back or I might call
Kick your desperate balls
From left or right or from below
You got desperate balls

You call those balls?
Feel the weight of mine!

You tried to take me on
For you I'm way too strong

Stand on my own - I'll always be a man

It's my command the mighty fall
Kick your desperate balls

Kick your desperate balls
So watch your back or I might call
Kick your desperate balls
From left or right or from below
You got desperate balls

Feel the weight of mine!
