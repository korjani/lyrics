Call up the guns
Beat on the drums
Join the hell

Grey magazines
Evil machines
Zero two ten

Eighty-eight millimetre mortal rounds
AK 47's make a hell of a sound
Rolling thunder's gonna get the better of you
If you wanna get ahead and win the hearts and minds

You gotta pull - pull - pull - pull the trigger
Fire your guns
You gotta pull - pull - pull - pull the trigger
Fire your guns

Pick up the phone
Start up the drones
Radio base

Head outta town
On enemy ground
Nothing to tell

Chain of command
News on demand
Security leaks

Innocent lives
Desperate lies
Deny all reports
