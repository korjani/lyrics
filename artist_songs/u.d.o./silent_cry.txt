Dancing in the daylight - all just been so fine
And heartbeats keep on going - all the time
Don't you hear the calling - don't you see the falling
All the cries
Can't you get the warning - how the pain is dawning
See the signs

When eyes don't see - and hands don't touch
It's all been a pack of lies
When hearts don't feel - it's all too much

It's just the sound of a silent cry
Just the sound of a silent cry

Crying in the moonlight - darkness closing in
I fear for the heartbeats - wondering
If we come together - is it so much better
I don't know
Why are we not trying - ending all the crying
Giving hope
