It was a perfect dream
A lovely wonder scene
It took me over and I surrendered

I felt the harmony
Was like a symphony
Drifting on a broken cloud

Then I wandered – nothing conquered
I had my faith – lost in time – lost in memory

I was lost in pain
Free from shame
Beauty has a consequence

Now I realised
It was cold as ice
Staring at a frozen mirror

Now the curtains closed – like a dying rose
No more fantasy for me
For me

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn’t show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn’t show
Why you left me all alone

Now I feel the loneliness
My bleeding heart is aching less
What a meaning - what a feeling

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn’t show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn’t show
Why you left me all alone

No more secrets in paradise
