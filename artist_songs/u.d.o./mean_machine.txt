The horror of a mad dog
Is chilling my blood in my brains
The lights disappearing
The cloud getting pregnant with rain
There's a rumor going round that
The master of darkness will come

They say he'll come from the sky
And there's nothing we can do
There'll be no place to hide
He's coming for me- he's coming for you!

Somewhere in time
Where creatures of the night never sleep
Lying and waiting, growing stronger
Planning our final defeat

They say he'll come from the sky...

Mean Machine
Comes from the sky
Stake your claims if you want to survive
Mean Machine
Comes from the sky
Don't try to run if you don't want to die
Mean machine
Comes from the sky
Stake your claims if you want to survive

[SOLO]

Mean Machine
Comes from the sky...
