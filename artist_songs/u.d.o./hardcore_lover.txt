You want a real story - Believe me
Been written so many times though you know them
But did you have to read it - Always
Did you ever start to think and reason why
You know you'd long to do it - Admit your dreams
So why don't you abuse it - I'm gonna set you free

I am a Hardcore Lover - I got my pride
I am a Hardcore Lover - Throwing you aside
I am a Hardcore Lover - Without a name
I am a Hardcore Lover - I'll bring you love and pain

Is it hard to sin for sinners
You haven't read the pages of my heart
Look inside and see what I deliver
Is the darkness of your soul reflecting back
You know you'd long to do it - Admit your dreams
So why don't you abuse it - I'm gonna set you free

I am a Hardcore Lover - I got my pride
I am a Hardcore Lover - Throwing you aside
I am a Hardcore Lover - Without a name
I am a Hardcore Lover - I'll bring you love and pain

I am a Hardcore Lover
I am a Hardcore Lover
I am a Hardcore Lover - Without a name
I am a Hardcore Lover - I'll bring you love and pain

I am a Hardcore Lover - Your high'n'dry
I am a Hardcore Lover - Gonna screw your mind
I am a Hardcore Lover - My name's your game
I am a Hardcore Lover - I'll bring you love and pain
