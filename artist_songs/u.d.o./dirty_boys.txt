Bad boys on the run tonight
There's streaming energy
The future holds retreat or victory
Strollin' through the neon light
You get no charity
Looking for a fight- out on the run

They're never gonna win
Unless the system is to burn
They're tearing our world apart
Because, they never wanna learn

Dirty boys always on the run
Until six o'clock in the morning
Dirty boys always having fun
Never get them out of my mind

Windows closed and doorways shut
There's trouble in the streets
Another girl gets crazy from the heat
Heavy current loads the air
Headgames all around
Tidal waves of lust and moaning sounds

There never gonna win...

Dirty boys always on the run
Until six o'clock in the morning
Dirty boys always having fun
Never get them out of my mind
Dirty boys always on the run
Never get them out of my mind

[SOLO]

They're tearing our world apart
Because they never wanna learn

Bad boys on the run tonight
Burning up the streets
The future holds retreat or victory
Heavy current loads the air- you get no charity
They're looking for a fight, this ain't no place to be

Dirty Boys...
