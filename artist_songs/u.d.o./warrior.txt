Wasn't there a time
When no one lived in pain
Zero down to zero
But a warrior

The innocence of birth
The power of the earth
Out of all that's good
Comes a warrior

Time- is it you who changes minds
Suing us- for something we've not done
Stealing the heroes- all the guiding lights, to find the way

Justice has been gone
To pieces for so long
Some killers call themselves
A warrior

Warriors with no pride
Committing suicide
The picture of a man
That's your warrior

'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom

'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom

Think about the time
Where manhood promised pride
And history was made
Just by warriors

We have to face the world
And hope that someone's heard
Who could replace a man
Like the warrior

'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom
'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom

Time- is it you who changes minds
Suing us- for something we've not done
Stealing the heroes- all the guiding lights, to find the way

'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom
'cause he's a warrior
Yes, he's a warrior
He fights for peace and freedom
'cause he's a warrior...
