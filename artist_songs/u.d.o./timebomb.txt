If God would be a liar
He would be just like us
We think he knows of madness
Who says he's got to be real

We can't wait another day
Where do we go from here
A sin is not the only way
But that's how it seems to be

We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines

The world is spitting fire
On sun and moon and stars
It can't be our desire
Writing the rules on the wall

We can't wait another day
Where do we go from here
A sin is not the only way
But that's how it seems to be

We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines

We can't wait another day
Where do we go from here
A sin is not the only way
But that's how it seems to be

We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines
We are timebombs- cold killing machines
