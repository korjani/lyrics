I'm mad - mad for crazy - I'm made to rock
Still mad for crazy - rolling to the top
Mad for crazy - I'm made to rock
Still mad for crazy - rolling to the top
I had some bad times
But I had good
I had some sad times
But we all should
I need the action
I need the ride
That's satisfaction
On overdrive
Just take look in my eyes
Take it - you won't be surprised
And all the nonsense inside
Nothing will stop 'cause I'm still
Mad for crazy - I'm made to rock
Still mad for crazy - rolling to the top
Mad for crazy - I'm made to rock
Still mad for crazy - rolling to the top
I feel the power
So look inside
I need the madness
So step aside
I am a racer
Adrenaline
Cut like a razor
So sharp and mean
