Heroes in the shadows
Just behind the scenes
Hiding in the alleys
Catch their silent screams

Resurrected faces
Passing on in time
Touch the ancient races
Memories in mind
Never hear their voices
Don't deny the proof
Always in the darkness
Never see them move

Heroes - shadows
Taking you apart
Heroes - shadows
They want you tonight
To heal you tonight

The wrong side of midnight
The beast walks alone
No time for the hour
There's blood on the bone

Secrets on papyrus
Bodies in the crypt
Don't release the virus
Kiss the poison lips
Mystic apparatus
Changing space and time
Cosmic revelation
Long forgotten signs
