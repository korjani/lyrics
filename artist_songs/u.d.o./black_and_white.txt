Eyes of fire, heart of ice,
Angel dreams, devil's vice
Set the spider to the fly
One more move and you will die
Hard and mean, cold desire

[Chorus:]
You're the one to give me light,
You don't even whet my appetite.
Black and white, black and white,
Black and white, black and white.

Heaven sent, kiss and tell
Hallowed soul gone to hell.
What it takes I'll make you mine,
Then you'll be broken for some time.
Sacred throne hard as stone

[Chorus]

Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Lose your soul, 'cause you've been framed.
You've got the devil in your eye,
See the viper and you kiss good-bye.

[Chorus]

Black and white, black and white,
Black and white, black and white.
