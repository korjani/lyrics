The wind it turns away gives me a chance to have my say,
And my tears that fall are broken by the raging storm.
No stones been left unturned in the castle of the legions,
Not a soul that's not been burned in the elemental regions.

[Chorus:]
A drop in the ocean,
A star in the sky,
A leaf in the forest,
A grain in the wild,
A cloud in the heavens,
A moment in life
That you wanna capture
In stillness of time.

The silent breath of night is turned by early morning light.
Here and there a call, a spirit feeds your desperate soul.
Silver rain that falls and mighty waves the seasons.
Golden skylight calls and dream a million reasons.

[Chorus x2]
