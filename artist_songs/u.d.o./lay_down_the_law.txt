You turn my head
You turn my life, am I up or down
Why don't you see, you're bugging me
I have already lost my way

Do I have to pay for everybody's shit
Is it the past, or the start
Why can't you make it easy
Why don't you leave me alone

Keep me alive- keep me alive
Why don't ya keep me alive, me alive

Lay down the law- fight for more
Lay down the law- double the trouble and kick some ass
Lay down the law- lay it down
Lay down the law- lay it down, ha ha

I'm giving up, waiting for more
I need to know what to do
And you can see, see it's me
The one who's breaking down

How many fights, how many lives
How many lives do I have to live
It's not alright, I'm tired
To pay those rotten dues

Keep me alive- keep me alive
Why don't ya keep me alive, me alive

Lay down the law- fight for more, yeah
Lay down the law- oh double the trouble and kick some ass
Lay down the law- lay it down, yeah
Lay down the law- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah

How many fights
How many lives, do I have to live
It's not alright, I'm tired
To pay those rotten dues

Lay down the law- fight for more
Lay down the law- double the trouble and kick some ass
Lay down the law- oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Lay down the law- you gotta fight, fight for more
Lay down the law
