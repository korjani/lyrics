Mystic rainbows- in the night
Flashing colours- shining bright
Can't you see me- in the dark
Feel a heat wave- of a spark

If you're fighting the world just beware of the knives in your back
When you need to defend then you know that it's best to attack

See the light- feel the pain- and you're going insane

Go back to hell- go back to hell
To the sight of mystic light you've seen before
Go back to hell- go back to hell
Where the dead are always knocking at your door

Feel so lonely- far away
Eat your heart out- time to pray
Moving faster- to the flames
And I'm playing- all the games

If you're fighting the world just beware of the knives in your back
When you need to defend then you know that it's best to attack

See the light- feel the pain- and you're going insane

Go back to hell- go back to hell
To the sight of mystic light you've seen before
Go back to hell- go back to hell
Where the dead are always knocking at your door

Go back to hell- go back to hell
To the sight of mystic light you've seen before
Go back to hell- go back to hell
Where the dead are always knocking at your door...
