Tonight- is a show
And I gotta be there
Banging my head to a metal attack
We got nothing to fear

Dancing and screaming begging our heroes for more
Burning the streets cause we gotta be first thru the door

We want it loud
There's no other reason we came for
We want it loud
The louder the better we need more

They keep us locked, locked in
For hours and hours we wait in line
You get pushed to the limit
We can't even breath no more

Like a volcano we're boiling and ready to blow
Fight all the way got to see this damn rock and roll show

We want it loud
There's no other reason we came for
We want it loud
The louder the better we need more
We want it loud- we want it loud- we want it loud
Yeah, it's gotta be loud

Yeah- we want it loud
There's no other reason we came for
We want it loud
The louder the better we need more

We want it loud
There's no other reason we came for
We want it loud
The louder the better we need more

We want it loud- we want it loud- we want it loud
We want it loud- we want it loud- we want it loud
Yeah, it's gotta be loud
