The crimson tide of speeding
And viruses proceeding
Well have our finest hour
With danger everywhere

The blood comes up to boiling
Injection guns recoiling
Instrumental power
Shockwaves in the air

And when you're feeling craziness
And climbing up the walls
It's just the metal parasite
And then you are.

Infected infected by the seed
Infected this is what you need
Infected infected one and all
Infected be ready for the call

Through the veins its crawling
And zombie time is dawning
Like a mental breaker
Head bombs crashing down

We cant be the healers
Were the poison dealers
The maker and the taker
Infected by the sound
