I've passed the lonely gates of Babylon
I've touched the ancient pyramids
I've seen the golden face of Taj Mahal
I've felt the sea of Atlantis

I've counted bricks along the China Wall
I've rode the Slopes Of Kathmandu
I've tasted all the rocks of Everest
To the mountains of the moon

I've seen it all
Through time and matter
No more retreat and no more defeat
So hear the call
The final battle
I'm under attack - I want to come back

I am the unknown traveler - always on the move
I am the unknown traveler
I am the unknown traveler - always on the move
I am the unknown traveler

I've joined the table back in Camelot
Looked for the wood for Merlin's wand
I've traveled places I've been everywhere
I've traveled times so on and on
