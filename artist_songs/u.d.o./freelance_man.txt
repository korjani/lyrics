You are a nothing and deceased
You ain't alive at all
Don't try to be sensible
I'll bang your head on the wall

I got no time to be locked in
I'm a dangerous son
You're always second
I'm the number one

Hail the battle

Take a bow
Monumental
Gonna stand my ground
I'm gonna stand my ground

'cause I'm a freelance man
I ain't walking I ain't talking tonight
Heart of steel - twisted feel - I'm no easy ride
You will never ever lock me up tight

'cause I'm a freelance man
And I'm breaking and I'm taking tonight
No mistake - don't dictate - I'm no easy ride
Don't you never ever lock me up tight

I'm always doing what I please
I'm always having a ball
You make me contemptible
I'll bury you in a hole

It's better you to be locked in
I'll be a terrible guard
You'll never matter
I'm still the number one

Hail the battle...

Turn on your brain before you talk
It was no secret what I am
You rue the day - you've been done over
I'm just a freelance man
