We are the boys who will guide you through
Hard cracked runaways, take no fools
Grey slab concrete, iron and bone
Don't look back, you'll be screwed to the floor
Kickback Cadillacs, ragged and cold
Red mist chicane switchblade zone
Look back in anger and you'll be done
Kissing the barrel of a steely gun

Streets of Sin
Streets - Streets of Sin

We are the guys who will make you move
Hip Hop renegades, the Gangsta' groove
Leather and Metal, Granite and Steel
We are the gang who will fix the deal
Jump suit, razor sharp, pinstripe mean
Headlights, fast nights, rugged and real
To hell with the devil, we shout it loud
All in together and we're standing proud

Streets of Sin...
