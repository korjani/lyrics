There are secrets better left alone
Like Pandora's box
Throw away the master key
High-tech fantasies
And the mystery of our history
Stories been untold
Some words have been classified
Hide the danger code
The scream to stop they silence
They're working on to win
Blinded by their science
They carry on the sin
Scream killers - right and always wrong
Scream killers
They are the scream killers - always go too far
Scream killers
Universal energy
The world is not enough
Science of insanity
'n' one day time is up
And they all dismiss the reason why
Playing with our fate
Cast away the destiny
Stop - or it's too late
Corruptible intruders
Seed the dragon's lair
Exposing generations
Fall out's in the air
Scientific meddling
Technology unleashed
Microbotic phasing
The helix of the beast
Even if there is a master code
Deep inside within
Follow nature's symphony
The only way to win
And the time has come to turn the game
Make your final choice
Listen to your heart and soul
Mind the inner voice
