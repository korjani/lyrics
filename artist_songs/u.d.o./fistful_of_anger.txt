Terror from the tower
Panic in the streets
A gun full of surprises
The special of the week

The wailing of the sirens
Multiple alarms
The screaming of the bullhorns
God bless the right to arm

The finger on the trigger
The target in the sights

And you will remember
Death comes day or right

I got a fistful of anger
A head full of pain
Belt full of bullets
Switchblade insane

My shelter on the rooftop
Up there in the blue
I hear a voice inside me
And who the fuck are you
