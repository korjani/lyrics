We lie and cheat the game
Corruption's everywhere
We try to buy our justice
Lies are hard to beat

When our days are over
Cross the great divide
The final day is coming
He knows wrong from right

Cut out the way it has been done
Just keep the fear inside
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Your life is on the line

Take the word of the arbiter
He always gets it right
Take the word of the arbiter
If it's left or if it's right

With him there's no objection
You can't have a deal
The word he says is final
Punishment's for real

Talking - never moves
You hear it in your head
Body shaken terror
And he cuts you dead

Take the word of the arbiter
His word s always right
Take the word of the arbiter
Nothing left and nothing right
