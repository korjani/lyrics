High voltage in the air
No way to know it's good or bad
Don't try to trick it down
Otherwise you could be dead

So just look out
It may be mean
Just can't be too afraid of this machine

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Restricted area
A hole in the middle of the night
Restricted area

Your brain's been mesmerized
And in your mind this place is full of steel,
so full of steel
So shift to overdrive
Crash away the gang with the men from another space

So be aware
Just leave the scene
The world's been metallized by this machine

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Restricted area
A hole in the middle of the night
Restricted area

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Restricted area
A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Restricted area

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
The world's been metallized
A hole in the middle of the night
Restricted area

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
It's a restricted area
Hold on - hold on - hold on
Your brain's been mesmerized

A hole in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night

You're heavy metallized
A hole in the middle of the night
