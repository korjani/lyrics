Night after night
Day after day
Hours and seconds to go

Dying of fright
Nothing to say
I've got no money to show

Picking at the bits and pieces of this puzzle game
Educated reasons why I have to wear this shame

Hey you - cut me out
Come back - and put my money down
Hey you - what have I done to you
Don't - don't spread the news around

Dreams in my sleep
Are tales from the cards
I see the final countdown

Reptiles that creep
Pushing me hard
Making me go one more round

Just another night - begging for mercy
What can I do - pleading 'n' searching
In the night
