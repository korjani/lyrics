Morning is breaking with death on the street
Driving downtown in a red corvette
The daemons and satans are creeping around
LA nights are madhouse nights

The murderers- are heroes
They're speeding all over the town
And justice- is drunken
I'm tumbling upside down

I'm a madman
Living in an animal house
I'm a madman
Living in an animal house
Living in an animal house

Rockers in concert are serving the bible
Praying in public is getting a habit
For selling out everything seems to be right, oh yeah
The sunset is crowded with tramps passing out

They're sleeping- in trash cans
There's witchcraft in everyone's eyes
Satans and daemons
All dressed up in suits and ties

I'm a madman
Living in an animal house
I'm a madman
Living in an animal house
Madman- going crazy- living in an animal house

I'm a madman...
