Welcome to the madness
Of symptomatic rule
It's deadly and it's reckless
Another one is fooled

Miniature devices
The ears within the walls
Stiletto knives and cameras
To document it all

And the stream of data flows - endless
Police protection grows - it's here to stay

Another state run - state run operation
Another state run - state run operation

Under observation
Disloyalty is out
Covert operations
That's what it's all about

Hidden automatics
Activate the fuse
Forbidden terror tactics
The system is in use

Finger pointing accusations - they deny
Governmental legislation - why
Immovable and firm positions - don't defy
Supremacy and allegations - part of life
