See horizons lie
Call your fate your sign
On your way, still your own
Marching from your home

So you lost - so am I
It makes you breathe
Tell me why - have you been gone
Where've you been
I change your time

He is the timekeeper - messing with your mind
Timekeeper - watching over you
He is the timekeeper - making all the rules
Timekeeper - coming over you

Out of sight and wrong - so wrong
Timeline dead and gone - are gone
Universal clash - a clash
Cleaning human trash

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]

He is the timekeeper - messing up your mind
Timekeeper - lording over you
He is the timekeeper - changing all the rules
Timekeeper - you still don't have a clue
