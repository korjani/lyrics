Fight for the right thing
Fight for yourself-no one should run your life
Believe in you- it's just the best to do

Before you're giving up
Stay put and give yourself a chance to grow
Get tough and rough- defend yourself on time

Get coming back for more
You gotta push it through
You're gonna make the truth come true

Back in pain- freedom is not free
Back in pain- freedom is not free

You see yourself so busy
Doing things people always telling you to do
No matter what- always on your own

Fight just for the right thing
Go all the way and never ever change it

Get coming back for more
You gotta push it through
You're gonna make the truth come true

Back in pain- I wanna see your pride
Back in pain- freedom is not free
Back in pain- you're gonna win this fight
Back in pain- freedom is not free, yeah

Oh yeah, you can't do it on your own
I tell ya nothing, nothing new
You gotta see yourself as what you are
Blinded by light and lost- lost in the dark

Back in pain- I wanna see your pride
Back in pain- freedom is not free
Back in pain- you're gonna win this fight
Back in pain- freedom is not free, yeah

Back in pain- I wanna see your pride
Back in pain
