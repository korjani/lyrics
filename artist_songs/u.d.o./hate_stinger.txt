For all of time we had a man
Who had a frozen heart
He's standing on a hill
And sees the morning come

Fear and rage - destruction
He made a world of pain
Hate and sin - confession
He craved a senseless crime

'cause he's a sane killer - he takes you by surprise
He's a sane killer - stares into your eyes
He's a hate stinger - nothing left to chance
He's a sane killer - and he's the last to dance

Just in time he finds the way
To do without the lies
It's time to bruise and maim
Stripped of all disguise

Fear and rage - destruction
No warning or a sign
Hate and sin - confession
He's deadly from behind

'cause he's a sane killer - he takes you by surprise
He's a sane killer - stares into your eyes
He's a hate stinger - nothing left to chance
He's a sane killer - and he's the last to dance

The devil rings - we pay the rent
The cruellest cut of all
We built the road he travelled on
The lessons come to call

So look for signs behind the eyes
Destructor of us all
Stands alone deathly still
The stealer has arrived

Fear and rage - destruction
He made a world of pain
Hate and sin - confession
He craved a senseless crime

'cause he's a sane killer - he takes you by surprise
He's a sane killer - stares into your eyes
He's a hate stinger - nothing left to chance
He's a sane killer - and he's the last to dance

'cause he's a sane killer - he takes you by surprise
He's a sane killer - stares into your eyes
He's a hate stinger - nothing left to chance
He's a sane killer - and he's the last to dance
