Detrimental assets
Money down the drain
Cash in all their pockets
Ride the gravy train
Playing at casinos
Yachts and caviare
Mistresses and champagne
Apartments and fast cars
Dehumanise resources
Fix the budget plan
A grey suit revolution
Hide the paper trail
You take a number for a number
Take a penny for a dime
A number for a number
Another dirty crime
Capital expenditure
Global energy
Upsize all the markets
Cost is misery
Siphon off the excess
Secretive accounts
Documents and contracts
Third world body count
