I give my finger to the system
I give my finger to it all
I don’t care about the reason
I don’t want it anymore

Let us live our life
Yes I can decide
Let us be alive
Put the pain aside
Then you know you’re living right

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
It’s enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I don’t want it anymore

I don’t wanna play your system
Don’t wanna play your stupid rules
I don’t care about your reasons
Don’t you take me for a fool

Let us live our life
Yes I can decide
Let us be alive
Put the pain aside
Then you know you’re living right

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
It’s enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I don’t want it anymore

Try eating some of your own shit – for once
Cos’ I’m not taking it – anymore

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
It’s enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I don’t want it anymore
