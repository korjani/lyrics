We hit your mind
We hit your soul
One of a kind
Always more and more
Thunder above
Lightening below
We're overhead
Nowhere else to go
Please, take my hand
It's so hard to stand
Never surrender - no time
Day after day
The game is to stay
Open your heart and you'll feel...
Shell shock fever
Shell shock fever - and we give you a high
Shell shock fever
Shell shock fever - and we light up the sky
We won't give up
Don't take the crap
Over and out
Take it high and low
We deal the dice
Join in the game
Make you alive
Turning on and on
