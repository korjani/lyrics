One life - never been a riddle
Black nights - live it to the max
It's all extremely done

No way - to colonize the middle
Ride hard - desperadoes at your back
Under a blood red sun

In this world - up to us
We stand or we fall - yeah

We got no limits - no hideaway
We got no limits - live today
We got no limits - the way to stay
We got no limits - no limits all the way

Gear up - life is what we make it
Rock hard - shaft it to the top
We've only just begun

Sun's up - we're gonna do some shakin'
Break out - we give it all we got
Make way 'cause here we come

In this world we decide
To answer the call - yeah

Power'n'riches'n'rank
Mean nothing at all
Render the game to the end
Once and for all - once and for all - yeah

We got no limits - no hideaway
We got no limits - live today
We got no limits - the only way to stay
We got no limits

Ev'rybody live the life
