Stop messing with my insides
I'm out of control
I always end up feeling
I'm digging my hole

You always came a-knocking
Shouting your rights
You've taken it all
Now it's my turn to fight

We always played this game
Overshadowed my mind
No more these crazy ways
You're finished this time

Tough luck - you did all for nothing
Keep your hate inside
Tough luck - you did all the running
A mean destructive mind

How does it feel to be lonely
And screaming for help
I know you're so restless
Not a slip of your mask

A world without fear
I'm thankfully free
Now nothing to stop
For me being me

My turn to play the game
I'm free in my mind
You've had your freedom-days
But now I've got mine
