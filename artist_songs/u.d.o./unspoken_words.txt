My thoughts are going back - back to the time
When I was young to live a life
A life of lies - full of lies

Then you came into my life
And you've changed so many things
That I've done before - that I've done before

Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way
Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way

You treated me the right way
You always said don't give up
Some day you will see what I have done

And when I start thinking about me
Then I find out
You did it right - just right

Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way
Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way

Unspoken words - so many unspoken words
They cannot lie to me anymore
Unspoken words - words so full of meaning
They cannot lie, they're from inside
Unspoken words

Back to start again - we're working still together
More than ever - better than before
Better than before

Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way
Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way - don't leave me this way

Unspoken words - so many unspoken words
They cannot lie to me anymore
Unspoken words - words so full of meaning
They cannot lie, they're from inside

All those unspoken words so many, many unspoken words
They cannot lie to me anymore, oh yeah
Without you I've been so alone
Don't leave me this way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Unspoken words...
