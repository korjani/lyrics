I was born in a backstreet
Where people live a dirty life
Of course it was different most of the time
But it was not my fault

A life in hell
I saw it every morning
Dreams'n'desires
Can't hide myself anymore

I tried to live in heaven
But this dream did not come true
I tried to live in heaven
Next time I'll try to knock on this door again

I've been hunting
Day and night
Oh, I've been losing
Please, hold me tight

Why am I here now
And what can I do
You tell me you're sorry
You know it ain't true

I tried to live in heaven
But this dream did not come true
I tried to live in heaven
Next time I'll try to knock on this door again
You know what I mean

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

Now I'm taking my chances
Everyday, everynight
You know what I'm talking about, man
No more backstreet life

A life in hell
I saw it every morning
Dreams and desires
Don't hide myself anymore

I tried to live in heaven
But this dream did not come true
I tried to live in heaven
Next time I'll try to knock on this door again
You know what I mean

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

I made it out of this hell you know what I mean

I tried to live in heaven
But this dream did not come true
I tried to live in heaven
Next time I'll try to knock on this door again
You know what I mean

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

'Cause when you throw in the cards
Life goes on and on
You're on a trip to nowhere
You'd better reach for the stars
Life goes on and on and on and on again

'Cause when you throw in the cards...
