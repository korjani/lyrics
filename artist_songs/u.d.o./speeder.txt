Switch on the power
Screaming fast
Lungs are burning – sucking in the dust
Like a freebird
Flying high
Tearing up the atmosphere - ripping up the sky

It’s faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

No way to stop it
Out of control
It has no limits – I want it all
High as a fever
Extreme and hot
Terrifies your braincells – it never stops

It’s faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder – deadlier then all
Speeder – like a thunderstorm
Speeder – like a wrecking ball
Speeder – faster then you all

Redline the hour
Coming fast
Countdown to zero – like a lightning blast

A supernova
Radiates
A thunderwall – it’s coming in your face

It’s faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder – deadlier then all
Speeder – like a thunderstorm
Speeder – like a wrecking ball
Speeder – faster then you all

Speeder
