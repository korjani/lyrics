How can we, who told the lie
Still feel the nature cry
So many sorries ignoring fears
A lonely voice, it's time to hear

So many times the stories been told
So many times we had warnings and all
One last chance - the final call

One lone voice in the midst of silence
One lone voice in an empty hall
One small light on the dark horizon
One lone voice always cries alone

Nations talk while losers die
We face a blood red sky
Join in the chorus and raise your voice
Nothing to lose and no more choice

So many times the stories been told
So many times we had warnings and all
One last chance - the final call

One lone voice in the midst of silence
One lone voice in an empty hall
One small light on the dark horizon
One lone voice always cries alone

Time is now, the time to change
Last chance to turn the page
Too late for sorrow, too late to cry
It's all on us - the wheel of life
