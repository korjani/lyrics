Preparing for the masses who will fight a horror war
With a little bit of luck and a powerful attack
Gonna force the allied law

Spreading death and blood- terrorizing all the world
In a bloody kinda hope like a killer working dope
Living weapons- cold as ice

Without a sign of fear in their face
They stand up in this serious race
Nothing to lose much to gain
Calling the shots in this game

Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Forcing you to run
Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Your life is in their hands

Defending all their idols hard as the burning land
In the middle of the night in a darkest hiding hole
Living legends will be born

Preaching peace of love- emphasizing to be strong
It's another kind of fight for another holy right
Living peaceful in this world

Without a sign of fear in their face
They stand up in this serious race
Nothing to lose much to gain
Calling the shots in this game

Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Forcing you to run
Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Your life is in their hands

We see them die- we see them cry
Pain and heartache- losses of lives
In their fearless hearts- they're rising high
To just another world of eternity

Without a sign of fear in their face
They stand up in this serious race
Nothing to lose much to gain
Calling the shots in this game

Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Forcing you to run
Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Your life is in their hands

Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Forcing you to run
Powersquad rules- powersquad wins
Your life is in their hands
