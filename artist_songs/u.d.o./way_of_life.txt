I've been away from home
Was out of sight
No other change has come
Who let the boredom in
We got our rocking rights
We'll overcome
The mirror never lies
We'll show 'em how it's done
We always dress in black
To be unkind
We always dress in black
With you in mind
It's the way of life we live
You know where we are coming from
It's the way of life we live in
We are the strong
We never will deceive
Take no double-talk
And all the fat cats bull
Don't like the way we walk
They spit behind our backs
Unwelcomed class
But it's way down deep
They wanna be like us
It's the way of life we live
You know where we are coming from
It's the way of life we live in
And we're not wrong
'cause it's the way of life we live
You know where we are coming from
It's the way of life we live in
We are the strong
