Mortui te salutant
Mortui te salutant

In days gone by - the Chinese man
As wise as he was old
Did formulate the concentrate
The world would now explode

The cannonball - the rifle shot
The forces we unfold
We devastate and terminate
A triumph - we are told

Who can tell - break the spell
Reign in hell - when you're messing with

The bullet and the bomb
The bullet and the bomb

The race was on - the will to kill
When science joined the game
Unmerciful and finally
It all became insane

In forty-five - catastrophe
In Oppenheimer's mind
And man did see the universe
Atomically collide
