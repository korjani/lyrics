I've not been home
For so many years
And I did not regret being gone

Please tell me when did we talk
And when did we show
That we do care for something called love

Oh no, don't you despair now
I'm as grown up as can be
Can't you forget everything
And this time listen to me

I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- why don't you help me
I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- why don't you love me

It's time to remember
What we've done together
I guess it is more than we know

And we should be open
And turn back the wheels
As far as we can go

I know I am your son
And everything else don't seem real
I want you back like never before
I can't take another goodbye

I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- please, can't you be there
I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- please, don't you leave me

What's done's done- I'm your son
I've been hurt by your lies
I want peace after all
That's why I want you to let me come home

I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- let's fight together
I'm coming home- home
I'm coming home- I've so much to tell you
Home- I'm coming home
I'm coming home- time heals the scars of the past
I'm coming home
I'm coming home- to be by your side
I'm coming home- I'm coming home
I'm coming home- I've so much to tell you
I'm coming home- I'm coming home...
