Screaming eagles everywhere
Wings of fire torch the air

Gods and ashes fall to earth
Mountains crash and seas do burn
Should we seek the soul of man
Look inside and touch the damned

Screaming screaming eagles
Speeding through electrosonic space
Screaming screaming eagles
Raising hell just for the doomsday race

Elemental enemies
Be prepared for what you'll see

Hearts of misery in the sand
Destiny you'll understand
Hold the sign you´ll be allowed
Step inside the mortal vows

Screaming screaming eagles
Speeding through electrosonic space
Screaming screaming eagles
Raising hell just for the doomsday race

Subzero machination doomed and vandalised
Hell fury consternation retromanic eyes
Deadly constellation sonic laserlight
Alien sensation the nightmare has arrived

On to battle mesmerise
Massive forces tenderise

Dark intruder regiments
In control it's your defence
Dare and spare another coin
Desperation you will join

Screaming screaming eagles
Speeding through electrosonic space
Screaming screaming eagles
Raising hell just for the doomsday race
Screaming screaming eagles
Speeding through electrosonic space
Screaming screaming eagles
Raising hell just for the doomsday race
