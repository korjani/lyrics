Don’t Wanna Read Between The Lines
I Know What’s Good, I Know What’s Fine
I Know What Makes Me Feel Just Right
Don’t Wanna Have An Endless Fight

And I Know – What’s Right
I Know What’s Right
And I Know – What’s Wrong

I Give As Good As I Get
I Give As Good As I Get

I Know What Time To Lay My Head
I Know The Answers Best Unsaid
And No Decree Can Make Me See
Another Way Of Being Me

I Know The Way To Cross A Street
I Even Know To Trick Or Treat
I Know What’s Right – I Know What’s Wrong
You Better Listen Or You’re Done

I Know There’s No One Same As Me
I Am Unique – I’ve Got To Be
This Is The Way – I Am For Real
The Only Way For Me To Feel
