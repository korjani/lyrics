Ticking like a time bomb
Counting on and on
Entering the danger zone
Coming to your town

I could stay forever
Living in your soul
I am not for hire
I'm just rock'n'roll

The devil walks alone
The devil walks alone
The devil walks alone
The devil walks alone

Kicking like a thunder ball
Straight into your brain
Power to the jungle law
Catch the heavy train

I am yours forever
Got you by the balls
Make it now or never
Take it heart and soul
