I pulled on
The highway
Another day for the wanderer

I knew something
Was out there
Around the corner from where we were

You could have
Cut and run
Straight back to Tennessee

But you stood true
A real rock
And never doubted me

[Chorus:]
I will be there
Any time you need me to
As much as you believed in me

I'm returning the faith to you
I'm returning the faith to you

You held me
With a sure hand
You gave love every step of the way

If it takes me
Forever
I'll give back everything that you gave

[Repeat Chorus]

You saved me, now baby
I wanna do a little something
for you

[Repeat Chorus]
