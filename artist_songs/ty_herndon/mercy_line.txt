[Laughing]

I was a little bit foolish,
And I got a whole lot of pride.
It took a whole lot of hammerin',
To get through this head of mine.
But, I ain't ready, baby,
To hang this one on the rack.
I just want you to know that,
Baby, I'm comin' back.

'Cause I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line.
Yes, I am. (Yes, I am.)
I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line.

Oh, that sweet temptation,
She's a fair-weather friend.
I blew down that road,
But I won't go there again.
I love you absolutely,
And if there's one thing I know.
It's gonna take you, baby,
For me to get back home.

I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line.
Yes, I am. (Yes, I am.)
Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line.
Oh, yeah.

I done a whole lot o' hurtin',
And I had a lot o' hurtin' done.
But I'll do my time,
Until the healin' comes.

Do what you have to do,
Till I win back your trust.
Our love is made of gold,
Yeah, baby, gold don't rust.
So when you're ready, willin'
And able to receive.
You know just where you'll find me,
I'll be here on my knees.

I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line.
Yes I am. (Yes, I am.)
I-I, I-I, I'm workin' on a mercy line.
Oh, yeah.

I'm workin' on a...
I'm workin' on a... (a mercy line.)
I'm workin' on a mercy line.

I'm gonna walk... (I'm workin' on a...)
I'm gonna walk... (I'm workin' on a...)
I'm gonna walk, (Yes, I'm workin',)
Back into your heart, babe. (On a mercy line.)

I'm workin' on a...
I'm workin' on a... (a mercy line.)
I'm workin' on a mercy line. (Yes, I am.)

Just keep on walkin', baby.
Just keep on walkin', baby.
(I'm workin' on a mercy line.)
Just keep on walkin', baby.
Just keep on walkin', baby.
