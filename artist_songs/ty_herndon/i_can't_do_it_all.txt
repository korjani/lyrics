I woke up missin you this mornin
After runnin into you last night
The way you kiss me like a friend is so heartwarming
But baby, when we meet again
If you really want to be my friend

Tell me that you're never ever comin back
When you're out on the town stop lookin like that
Tear out your telephone jack in case I get the urge to call
Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart
Tears to stop, a new life to start
Put my world against the wall
I could use your help, I can't do it all

Try to make myself believe it's over
But I don't believe I'm equal to the task
I got a million memories to go

And I'm gettin' nowhere
Oh, and help is hard to find
So if you could be so kind

Tell me that you're never ever comin back
When you're out on the town stop lookin like that
Tear out your telephone jack in case I get the urge to call
Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart
Tears to stop, a new life to start
Put my world against the wall
I could use your help, I can't do it all

Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart
Tears to stop, a new life to start
Put my world against the wall
I could use your help, I can't do it all
