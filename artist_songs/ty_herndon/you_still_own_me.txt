I put a "For Sale" sign on the front of my truck,
It said, "Call anytime, I'm always up.
Make an offer. One that I won't refuse."
I bought a one-way ticket on a west-bound plane,
Four hours later I was wearin' shades in California.
Yeah, just hangin' loose.
I didn't pack one memory, and even though I'm free,

I can't go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be, but baby, hey-eah, you still own me. 
Say what I wanna say, hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream, but baby, you still own me.

I was up all night 'cause I couldn't sleep.
Instead a-starin' at the ceilin' I hit the beach.
Took a long walk. It didn't help me much.
I sat down in the sand with a handful of shells,
Kicked off my shoes while me, myself and I watched,
The sun come up, lookin' out across the sea.
Oh, well, it finally dawned on me.

I can't go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be, but baby, hey-eah, you still own me.
Say what I wanna say, hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream, baby hey-eah, you still own me.

Maybe I'm not in your arms. You still own me.
But you're still in my heart.

I can't go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be, but baby, hey-eah, you still own me. 
Say what I wanna say, hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream, but baby, you still own me.

Oh, yeah. Alright.
