One man can't sleep in his penthouse bed
Wall Street worries fill his head
While another man dreams
In his cardboard shed on Broadway
Early morning traffic jam
Wake up call for both of them
Will work to eat asks easy street for small change
And which one needs it more
The rich man or the poor
A change of heart and attitude 
unselfishness meets gratitude

[Chorus:]
It's enough to put tears in God's eyes
Enough to make the angels cry
When the power of love lifts someone above
The emptiness of their unbearable life
It's enough to put tears in God's eyes

Late at night a baby cries
His mother gives him life then dies
With no one even by them to be sad
But another woman fills the need
It's her heart and his mouth she'll feed
When she gives her love to the child she never had
Oh which one needs it more
It's hard to say for sure
When something grows where nothing was
As strong as any bond of blood

[Repeat Chorus]

Every minute every day a little miracles done
Someone opens up their heart and lets it shine like the sun
And just the light of that one

[Repeat Chorus]
