Everybody held their breath the moment you walked through that door
Everybody thought that I would crumble when you said "hello"
But I know something that they don't know
I've learned the art of not letting the heartache show

[Chorus:]
I am the man
Who learned how to lie
Made everyone think that I'm alright
I am the man
Who managed to smile
Foolin' the world for a little while
Seein' her tonight starts this hurtin' inside
I guarantee that she'll never know
'Cause I am the man
Who learned how to lie

I walk across the room to show the two of them how cool I am
Tryin' not to stare at the ring that's there on her left hand
I see the light of his love in her eyes
God I practiced this moment a million times

[Repeat Chorus]

Someday
I won't be a liar
I'll let my heart feel the fire
Of falling in love again
But until then

[Repeat Chorus]

I am the man
Who learned how to lie
