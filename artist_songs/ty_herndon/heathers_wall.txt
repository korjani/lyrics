Well it feels like slow motion, I hear the gun explode
I see the flash that brings me to my knees
And I feel the warmth flowing out of me

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there
October 99, I see us in New England in the Fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall

I see the money on the floor and his gun there by the door
He was trying to rob the bank when I walked in
Oh but this is not the way it's s'pose to end

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there
October 99, I see us in New England in the fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall

Oh somewhere, someone says, "We've lost him now"
But I look up and I see Heather's smile
So how can I be dying?

When I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall, and I see a bright light there
October 99, that picture of New England in the fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's Wall, hanging on Heather's Wall
