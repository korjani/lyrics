I know my back can bend and bear the weight
And these two hands of mine...they never shake
At least not up til now
So many heartbeats and it's never missed
But I'm not sure if I can handle this
I guess I'll find out
Oh, I guess I'll find out

[Chorus:]
How much can one man love you
How much can one man care
How much can one man need you
How much do I dare

I know my eyes can see for miles and miles
My legs can walk a good long while
That's never been in doubt
I always keep my passions locked away
So what will happen now is hard to say
Once I let them out, Oh I guess I'll find out

[Repeat Chorus]

If I never let you go
Maybe then I'll know

[Repeat Chorus]
