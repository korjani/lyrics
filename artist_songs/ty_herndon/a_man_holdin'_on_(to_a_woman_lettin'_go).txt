Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
A man holding on to a woman letting go.

There's a man with a bottle on the other side of town
Swimming with a memory that he can't drown
Lord, it ain't sunk in that she ain't coming home
Oh, a man holding on to a woman letting go.

His heart is telling him to hang on for dear life
Cause deep down he knows she's letting go for good this time.

There's a daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
Fighting back tears and forcing a smile
Oh, For 22 years he's watched her grow
A man holding on to a woman letting go

In the Hill Valley Home there's a feeble old man
And he's holding on to a fragile old hand
And the angels are coming to carry her home
Now he's a man holding on to a woman letting go

His heart is telling him to hang on for dear life
Cause deep down he knows she's letting go for good this time.

Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
Oh, a man holding on to a woman letting go.

A man holding on to a woman, a woman letting go.
