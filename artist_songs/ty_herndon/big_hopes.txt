I'm not brave, and I'm not too smart
The tin man wouldn't trade for my heart
Got two left feet when I am dancing
A long history of brief romances

Got no rubies, got no diamonds
None passed down and I can not but them
Got a box of hurt and a bag of shame
And you barely know my name

I've got big, big hopes about you
I've got big, big hopes

Got an old leather jacket, would look good on you
And lots of friends they would like you too
I've got some pull with the moon and tides
And thirty two dollars, let's go somewhere tonight

I've got big, big hopes about you
I've got big, big hopes

I've had hopes before, but not like this
I'm flying over the edge into loves sweet abyss

I've got some pull with the moon and tides
And thirty two dollars, let's go somewhere tonight
