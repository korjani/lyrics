I wonder if she lays awake at night
And thinks about what we had
Every now and then I'm haunted by tears
I wish you didn't leave like that
I know I should let her go but I can't

I wish I could call and say
I think we made a big mistake
I'm sorry for everything
But too many nights have gone by
I wish I could take her hand
And tell her I want one more chance
She's probably moved on by now
But I can't

I keep myself busy all the time
To stop my mind from wandering, yeah
I wonder if he misses holding me
Like I miss holding him
I could lie to myself and say I don't want him back
I know I should let him go but I can't

I wish I could call and say
I think we made a big mistake
I'm sorry for everything
But too many nights have gone by
I wish I could take his hand
Tell him I want one more chance
He's probably moved on by now
But I can't

How could we have thrown our love away
I can't live one more hour one more day
Without you
Without you
By my side

Baby I just called to say
I think we made a big mistake
I'm sorry for everything 
Too many nights have gone by
I wish I could take her hand
And tell her I want one more chance
He's probably moved on by now
She's probably moved on
But I can't

No I can't
No I can't
