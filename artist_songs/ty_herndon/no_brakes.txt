We won't know where we're going til we get there
But baby you can dream while I drive
Just tell me you'd go with me anywhere
Take my hand and we'll wave goodbye

[Chorus:]
As this engine whines across the danger line
Down a road Dare-Devil straight
There's no stopping us southbound sun up
In love too wild to wait
Oh, hearts wide open no brakes

There's a hunger for you running through me
An endless unbeatable thrill
And the spirit of life you give to me
So restless, so reckless and real

[Repeat Chorus]

You feel that lightening and thunder
Running through my veins
A world of wonder still untamed

[Repeat Chorus]
