I went to pieces when she blew in
Like a strong man running through a hurricane wind
Before I had a clue how bad it would be
She tore my heart out and she showed it to me

Like a bone in a pit bull pen
She chewed me up and spit me out again
My knees still shake, my ears still ring
All in all it was a pretty good thing
All in all it was a pretty good thing

That was one ride that I'll never forget
I still ain't found all the pieces yet
She stripped my gears-she stole my shocks
And she left me sitting up here on these cinder blocks

Like a bone in a pit bull pen
She chewed me up and spit me out again
My knees still shake, my ears still ring
All in all it was a pretty good thing
All in all it was a pretty good thing

I know it's bound to sound a little crazy to you
But it sure was good for a minute or two

Like a bone in a pit bull pen
She chewed me up and spit me out again
My knees still shake, my ears still ring
All in all it was a pretty good thing
All in all it was a pretty good thing
