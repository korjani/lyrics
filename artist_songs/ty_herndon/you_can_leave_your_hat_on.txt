Baby take off your coat
Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Go over there
Turn on the light
All the lights
Come over here
Stand on that chair
Yeah, that's right
Raise your arms in the air
Now shake 'em

You give me reason to live

You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Suspicious minds keep talkin
They try to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of ours
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
But I know what love is

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on...
