You say you love me a little
You say you want to stay friends
You say you don't want no strings attached
No one on you to depend
You see love as a prison, I see love as a key
You think a little is more than enough
It's not that way for me

I need to be loved too much
I need to be held too tight
I need to hear someone say at the end of the day
I'll make everything right
When the rest of the world goes home
I need to feel someone's touch
I've been alone too long, now I need to be loved too much

Too much sun will burn you
Too much rain you'll drown too
Much cold will freeze you
Too much wind will blow you down 
But love is something different that disregards the rules
You call me a dreamer, but sometimes dreams come true

I need to be loved too much
I need to be held too tight
I need to hear someone say at the end of the day
I'll make everything right
When the rest of the world goes home
I need to feel someone's touch
I've been alone too long
Now I need to be loved too much
