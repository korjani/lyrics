She's one in a million
I've heard that a million times
The odds were less than
Even she'd be mine

How many times does a dream come true
Come into your life
I can't believe the way she makes me feel
I have to pinch myself to know it's real

[Chorus:]
A touch so soft, a smile so sweet
She's so much like an angel
she's heavenly
She's as perfect as anyone can be
But her heart is only human 
Guess that's why she's loving me

She could've had anyone she wanted
But still she wanted me
I do my best to give her what she needs
I thank my lucky stars above
That I'm the one she loves
So many men will never find their way
To what I wake up looking forward to each day

[Chorus]

God never made a more down to earth girl
But the love she gives me takes me
Right out of this world

She's as perfect as anyone can be
But her heart is only human
Guess that's why she's loving me
