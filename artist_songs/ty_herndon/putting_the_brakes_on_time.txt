I'm cuttin off the telephone
You unplug the tv
At the rate life's passin us by
We can't take the time to breathe

I know you can't turn time around
But maybe there's a way to slow it down

Sippin' iced tea from a backporch swing
Layin' by a river as the wold runs by
Makin' sweet love while the Mockingbird sings
We can try, puttin' the brakes on time

When did we last have a heart to heart talk
Over a glass of wine
Or stop and watch the grass grow

Or smell a honeysuckle vine

We can't put the sand back in the hourglass
But we can hold each other baby
And make the weekend last

Sippin' iced tea from a backporch swing
Layin' by a river as the wold runs by
Makin' sweet love while the Mockingbird sings
You and I, puttin' the brakes on time

Puttin' the brakes on time

We've been sippin' iced tea from the backporch swing
Lay down by the river as the world runs by
Make sweet love while the Mockingbird songs
Can't stop the clock but we can't sure enough try
To put the brakes, put the brakes on time
