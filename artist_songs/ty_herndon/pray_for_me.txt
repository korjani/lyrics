He had a bottle in his left hand an old Bible in his right
I thought now there's a sinner when he asked me for a light
He hit me for a dollar I just turned and walked away
I was feeling high and mighty when I heard him say

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you

I thought who is he to pray for me as I hit my power lock
And then the weight of my hypocracy fell on me like a rock
I caught him at the corner and I give him my last 10
I say please forgive me brother and until we meet again

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you

You know each of us is broken somewhere deep inside
And we're really not that different when you strip away the pride
We've all got our struggles and chains that we can't break
And you never know the difference on simple prayer can make
I stood there on the corner and I watched him drifting off
As the sun behind St. Mary's made the shadow of a cross
On a street of busy people and places on the run
I felt like calling out to each and every one

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you
Pray for me
Pray for me
