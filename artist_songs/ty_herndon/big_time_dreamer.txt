You may not know it now
But you and I were meant to be
Why I are you so afraid
Of a little destiny
If I had to wait to turn your heart around
Patience is a virtue that's been handed down

[Chorus:]
I'm the son of a big time dreamer
That's where I get my dreamin' from
Daddy was a firm believer in the power of love
You say I'm crazy to fall for you
That's what my mama told my daddy too
I'm the son of a big time dreamer
Baby make my dreams come true

I guess it's in my bones
I guess it's in my blood
I'm a romantic fool
Like my father's father was
Remember back in school we learned what Einstein said
It's all relative 

[Repeat Chorus]

The way I feel for you it isn't hard to see
The apple doesn't fall far from the family tree

[Repeat Chorus]
