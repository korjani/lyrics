Come to me, now that we know where we're going
Come to me, for the light of dawn is glowing
Fly with me, just the sun, you and I
Oh, how high we'll be

Come to me, leave the night time fire in embers
Come to me, we'll find new warmth to remember
Fly with me, just the sun, you and I
Oh, how high we'll be

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba, ba ba

Run to me through the mist of dusk and dawnlight
Run to me in the glistening crystal sunlight
Fly with me, just the sun, you and I
Oh, how high we'll be

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba, ba ba
