Come on in 
You know you're welcome here
Come on in 
It's been a long cold year

Now I don't know what went wrong
But one whole year has passed us by and gone
We're back together now where we belong
So baby, come on in (Come on in)

Come on in (Come on in)
You sure look good to me
Come on in (Come on in)
I'm as lonely as I can be

Over there in the corner is your old chair a waitin'
Sittin' in the corner justa anticipatin'
What a long, long time it's been
So baby, come on in

Come on in (Come on in)
You know you're welcome here
Come on in (Come on in)
It's been a long cold year

Now you know why I waited around
Time is nothin' that could bring me down
I knew if I waited I would win
So baby, come on in

Come on in
