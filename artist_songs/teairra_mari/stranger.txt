[Verse 1]
I should've thought twice before before I gave you my hand
And let you take a part of me that I want back.
And now I'm all tangled up sitting here stuck on you.
How did I let it get this far?

I should've never fell in love, I should've known you weren’t the one.
I should've seen it from the start that you would go and break my heart.

[Chorus:]
I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've thought about it a little bit longer
Before I let you in.

I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've never made the mistake that I did
When I let you in life.

I should've kept you a stranger
Ah-ah, oh-ooo, ah-ah, oh-oo, ah-ah, oh-oooooooo

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling so empty now, I gotta move on but how
To think I ever will believe in love again?
After I gave you second chance, for you to turn around and let me down
How will I ever trusted again?

I should've never fell in love, I should've known you weren’t the one.
I should've seen it from the start that you would go and break my heart.

[Chorus]
I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've thought about it a little bit longer
Before I let you in.

I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've never made the mistake that I did
When I let you in life.

[Bridge]
I wish I stayed away, I wish I didn’t hurt
I wish I didn’t cry every night before bed
(I should've never) gave you my heart
(I should've never) wasted my time
I should've never let you in
I wish that I never met you, stranger

[Chorus]
I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've thought about it a little bit longer
Before I let you in.

I should've kept you a stranger I walk by every day.
Stranger, simple "Hi, how’s your day?"
I should've never made the mistake that I did
When I let you in life.

I should've kept you a stranger
Ah-ah, oh-ooo, ah-ah, oh-oo, ah-ah, oh-oooooooo

I said it babe, I said it babe, oh, oh-oooooo
I wish I never let you in
Should've kept you a stranger
