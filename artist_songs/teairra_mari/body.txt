Tryna Pick What I'll Put On Tonight 
Oh Tonight
Find Something That'll Make Me 
Feel Like A Lady And I'm Sure
It's Gonna Catch Your Eye
Oh And All Night

[Chorus]
From My
Head Shoulders Knees Toes

Head Shoulders Knees Toes
My Pretty Body Body
You Gon Want This Pretty Body Body

While I'm Walking To My New Boo
Tonight .. Tonight

You Can Kick Back And 
Just Watch All Night

You Can Look

You Used To Act As If You Ain't It
So I Made The Decision To Move On
But Just For The Hell Of It
I'll Send You A Picture
I'll Write You A Love Note
So You Can Remember Me Sayin
Look At Look At Look At Me
Look At Look At Look At This
Look At What You Coulda Had
Look At What You'll Never Get

Head Shoulders Knees Toes
