U did that [x2]

[2 Chainz:]
Wake up in the am, put that ass to pm
See them, ain't nothing like we baby I'm the bm
Several sinos, tall glasses of pinos
Starving for your love baby, come and feed my ego
See she know that I know
I man want her back like repo
With that bullshit is a drug baby I can get the rico
Rico suave, work hard on my off days
Hard drop for your hard ache dick hard concrete
One deep I'm solo, on a high horse like polo
I did, I'm in a photo, of a photo
She like oho, I'm like oho
She like oh no, I'm like oh what
She said a man called and I'm so what?
Big money more boulder
Pour girls like a cold truck
And I bring her down, take her down, lay her down
If it's me with you baby, ain't no lames around
What came around goes around, that's the part of the cycle
If sex is weapon, I'm holding on to my rifle, oh

[Teairra Mari:]
I don't know which way I'm going
I can't tell my up right now from down
I'm 10 seconds from exploding,
Captivated, trapped inside your sound
Jump in don't worry you won't drown
And just when I thought no one can do it better, do it better, better, better, better than him
They way you lay it down you're sexist, forcing me to stand corrected
And just when I thought I'd be opened forever, you went and made me forget about him
I'm glad that I showed him the exit, oh I swear boy
U did that, u did that yeah [x2]
Never thought this love could be a pain
That's cause I had nobody to compare to
Now I feel like he's just in the way
Ever since I went there with you
Never been so turned up, so turned out and turned on
I'm so glad he's gone, cause you're the one I want
And just when I thought no one can do it better, do it better, better, better, better than him
They way you lay it down you're sexist, forcing me to stand corrected
And just when I thought I'd be opened forever, you went and made me forget about him
I'm glad I showed him the exit, oh I swear boy
U did that, u did that yeah [x2]
