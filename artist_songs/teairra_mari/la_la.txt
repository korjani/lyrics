(Track boys S dot)
Lets go

[Guy:]
Ayo Teairra What's up girl
Damn you looking incredible these days you know
Are you still with ol' dude?
I be seeing you out the ghetto
But you know he can't do what I can do for you
I can change your life you know

[Teairra:] Uh huh, Oh for real?

[Guy:] You need to be f*cking with a nigga like me ma

[Verse 1:]
All ya'll wankstas be talking that La
Think I'm gonna leave my nigga, you smoking that La
He may not have millions but he give me enough
That feel good conversation and trust
Any time I need him he will out, want to bust
Damn well will lay a nigga out for the us
Yeah you might be gangster
But gangster ain't enough
Cuz these dickies have his name written in the cut

[Hook:]
Ohh, he treats me so good
Ohh, you wishing you could
Axe him, nix him, make me forget him
But there ain't nothing out here that's like him

[Chorus:]
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)

[Verse 2:]
See that's the damn problem with the male species (Uh huh)
Ya'll think ya'll can hit every ball in the league (Uh huh)
But you'll keep poppin foul as you talk to me
Wondering why girls dating girls got you intrigued
But that's irrelevant when it comes to me
My man got it locked when it comes to heap
I can see that you won't ever succeed
At pleasing a girl 101 so class is ending
(Lets go, lets go)

[Hook:]
Ohh (Ohh), he treats me so good
Ohh (Ohh), you wish that you could
Axe him, nix him, make me forget him
But there ain't nothing out here quite like him

[Chorus:]
La La me, you think you gon' La La me (Oh)
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to La La me (You're so typical, yeah yeah)
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La) (Let it go)
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to La La me (Your pimpin' ain't strong, no it ain't)
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)

[Bridge:]
All my ladies
My real down ladies
Want these lame ass busters to stop
Stop tryin to holler when I told you about 'em
And the game that you're spittin ain't hot
All my (All my)
All my real ladies
That want these lame ass busters to stop
Stop tryin to holler when I told you about 'em
And the game that you're spittin ain't hot

[Chorus:]
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)

La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)
La La me, you think you gon' La La me
Your pimpin' just ain't enough to
La La me
I told you that in his arms is where I'd be
You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)

[Spoken rap:]
