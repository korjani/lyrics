Baby I deserve better
You know I deserve better
Baby I deserve better
You know I deserve better

You hit me up, don't hit me back
Oh, you don't know how to act
See, what you don't do, he would do for me
Won't be blinded by my feelings
You've been scheming on the low
Creeping on the low
Boy, you think your slick but I already know
Don't know who you've been with before
If she ain't let you know
I ain't like them other girls, baby, oh

You can forget about us, baby
I read between the lines, so baby
I never thought I'd take that
You ain't good for nothing and you don't deserve my loving cause

I deserve better, than you
I deserve better
Play your games with someone else
I deserve better, than you
Chucking up the deuces cause I deserve better than you baby
I deserve I deserve
I deserve I deserve
Better than you
I deserve, I deserve
I deserve, I deserve

I'm be like fall away down
Hey, I wouldn't give your love away
But what's a girl to do now, hey
Got me feeling some type away
Cause you've been scheming on the low
Creeping on the low
Boy you think your slick but I already know
Don't know who you've been with before
If she ain't let you know
I ain't like them other girls, babe, oh

You can forget about us, baby
I read between the lines, so baby
I never thought I'd say that
You ain't good for nothing and you don't deserve my loving cause

I deserve better, than you
I deserve better
Play your games with someone else
I deserve better, than you
Chucking up the deuces cause I deserve better than you baby

You hear me out, don't win me back
Oh, you don't know how to act
See, what you won't do, he will do for me

Play your games with someone else

Chucking up the deuces cause I deserve better than you baby
