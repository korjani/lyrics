Yeah... right... yeah...
Uh huh
Yeah... right... yeah...
Turn the lights off

Maybe I forgot his birthday... Oops
I meant to take him to lunch this afternoon
Now his pissed off in the worst way
I hope he gets over this attitude real s0on

[Chorus:]
I guess I did something so wrong...
Cause my baby won't pick up the telephone...
And he ain't even coming home
And it's been so long

So I say hello operator... hellooo
Can you put my baby on the line
So that we can get together later
Cause I really want to spend some time...
Cause he won't... he won't... he won't... he won't... he won't [x3]
He won't answer my call
Can you put my baby on the line

I was shopping with my my homegals
Didn't expect him to act so immature
He be off in his own world...
I thought my baby was in so insecure

[Chorus]

Maybe I should send him some flowers or a card
Some candy or a letter cause his taking it so hard
I should take him on a Shopping spree
Let's ball out at the mall
Out wine him and dine I might as well have me a ball...

[Chorus]
