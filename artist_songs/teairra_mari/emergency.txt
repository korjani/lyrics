Uh-oh I did it again 
Just when I thought I couldn't fall no deeper 
Somehow I bumped right into him 
I guess the game of love is ready to begin 
I got a page added to the story 
Feelings are hard to pretend 
I thought my heart just couldn't get much weaker 
But somehow it bruises breaks and bends 
I want to hate him but he hits me with that grin 
And now I'm back in love again nooo-u-woahhh 

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling 
Emergency I need your healing me 
So send rescue hear for meeee 
It's an emergency 
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless) 
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee 
Ohhhh emergency 

Can't get him out of my mind 
I'm so infatuated with his swagger 
His style is so one of a kind 
I think of him and now wish I could press rewind 
My hair was fine only coming for me 
I can't take rejection this time 
My heart is still bleeding from the last dagger 
I vowed to leave the pain behind 
And baby love is like a mountain I can't climb 
Just when I thought that I was fine no call 

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling 
Emergency I need your healing me 
So send rescue hear for meeee 
It's an emergency 
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless) 
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee 
Ohhhh emergency 

We both shared favorite orchids and watched vintage movies 
Our signs are so compatible the chemistry is their 
Ooowhoo but why am I so scared 
I'ma call emergency baby yeah 

[Chorus]
Emergency I got this feeling (I'ma bout to call them) 
Emergency (because I think I've fallen yeahh yeah e yeah) I need your healing me 
So send rescue hear for meeee 
It's an emergency 
Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless) 
Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee 
Ohhhh emergency 
Ohhhh emergency
