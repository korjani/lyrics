[Verse 1:]
Well let me start out by saying this
And there ain't no game in this
Don't even think you waste my time
I know that I'm not the only one
So don't get it twisted son
No, I don't think that you're all mine
Baby boy what I do know 
Is that I'm inexpandable
You'll never find another like me
Cuz all the others just fall in line
I come first and they're behind
This is where you need to be

[Hook:]
Cuz you think that I'm just whatever (Whatever)
Trust me, it don't get no better
I don't know what you've been told
But I know you won't disagree

[Chorus:]

Boy you can't lie
You know that I'll be everything you need (you need)

That's why I'm your wifey
Can't another girl on earth see me (See me)

[Verse 2:]
So don't even try to play me love
Like a silly girl
Cuz it ain't going down like that
And yeah I know you got plenty friends and I'm just one of them
But baby I'm not falling back
I just want you to know that I'm still gonna ride for you
Cuz we still have fun
