Sit down for a minute
I need you to listen
My heart is only tryin' to understand
I already stumbled and fell into your love
Like a castle falling in the sand

You were never there to hold me
When I needed your hands
You were never there to listen
When I needed a friend
Gave me lovin' for a day
And never gave it again
Now I'm standin' outside your door

Knock knock knock
Nobody's there but me
Am I the only one hangin' on
Knock knock knock
Nobody's home but me
I'm the only one hangin' on
One-sided
One-sided
One-sided love

Love's so deceivin'
You had me believin'
That you would never let me down
You dangled your candy in front of a baby
And you took your sweets across the town

You were never there to hold me
When I needed your hands
You were never there to listen
When I needed a friend
Gave me lovin' for a day
And never gave it again
Now I'm standin' outside your door

Knock knock knock
Nobody's there but me
Am I the only one hangin' on
Knock knock knock
Nobody's home but me
I'm the only one hangin' on
One-sided
One-sided
One-sided love

What happened to the days
That we used to spend together
Breakfast lunch and dinner
We used to be together
Sittin at home
Watchin' movies all alone
Lookin' at the phone
Waitin' for you to
You have me goin' crazy

Knock knock knock
Nobody's there but me
Am I the only one hangin' on
Knock knock knock
Nobody's home but me
Nobody cares for me
I'm the only one hangin' on
One-sided
Nobody's here with me
One-sided
One-sided love
Who's gonna love me
Who's gonna hold me
