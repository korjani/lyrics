I could be your smile baby
I could be your high baby
I could be your power baby
I can make you smile baby
I can make you dance baby
I can make you sing baby
I could set you on fire baby
I could be your star baby

I am your kind
In your life
But something is missing
In my parents eyes
Boy you hold the key
I saw you in my dreams
Like an angel without wings
I want you here with me

You and me in the breeze
You and me in the trees
You and me floating
To heaven baby
To heaven baby
You and me on the scene
You and me running
You and me gunning
To heaven baby
To heaven baby

I could be your remedy
And give you the good shit you need
I could make it better baby
I know these things
I could wear you on my sleeve
Even when you're makin' me bleed
I love it when ya down on your knees
That's when you need me baby

I am your kind
In your life
But something is missing
In my parents eyes
Boy you hold the key
I saw you in my dreams
Like an angel without wings
I want you here with me

You and me in the breeze
You and me in the trees
You and me floating
To heaven baby
To heaven baby
You and me on the scene
You and me running
You and me gunning
To heaven baby
To heaven baby

I wanna be the one that you talk to
Be the one that you want
To love
Be the one that you call
Be the one of all
Be the one that you want for life

You and me in the breeze
You and me in the trees

You and me on the scene
You and me running
You and me gunning
To heaven baby
To heaven baby
