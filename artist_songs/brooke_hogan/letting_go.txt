I think I'm going to take it slow
And tell you the things that are on my mind
Then you can drop me off at home for the last time
I only wanted you to know that
I always had the best of intentions

Look at what you put me through
Anything I would have done for you
But it's not how it used to be
When you and I were hooked on each others dreams
Got stuck in reality and you couldn't
Make everything feel alright
When I gave you the best of me I never
Thought you'd give me a reason
To tell you I'm leaving I ran out of
Patience when you started changing
And there's no tears left to cry
Kept on hoping we could find a way to make it real
And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
And I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

Now I'm not trying to regret anything
I that have done or the things I have said
Life has a way of change like the season
Summer, spring, winter and fall
Sometimes I feel all alone I wish
You were there on special occasions
Feelings for you I cant hide but
I know better than to drop my pride

But it's not how it used to be
When you and I were hooked on each others dreams
Got stuck in reality and you couldn't
Make everything feel alright
When I gave you the best of me I never
Thought you'd give me a reason
To tell you I'm leaving I ran out of
Patience when you started changing
And there's no tears left to cry
Kept on hoping we could find a way to make it real
And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
And I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

I've made up my mind (i've made up my mind )
No more tears to cry (now there's no tears left to cry)
I didn't believe you each and everytime
You said you changed I knew that things would stay the time
It would only be right if I went on with my own life

Kept on hoping we could find a way to make it real
And tell myself that it's getting
Better when it never will
You know I would never want for you to be alone
Its so hard to tell you so
But I'm letting go

Its alright I don't want another try
Cause I'm letting go
You can leave you don't even say goodbye
Cause I'm letting go
