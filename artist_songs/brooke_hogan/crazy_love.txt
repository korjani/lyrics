You're gonna miss that crazy love (you're gonna miss that) 
You're gonna miss my sexy body (crazy lovin baby) 

I tried to love you 
I backed up off you 
Didn't crowd your space
I should have known better 
For you I do whatever it takes 
But you had to get greedy 
And you made it look easy 
Lie to my face 
Lately its been a lie 
A helpless case 

One of these mornings 
You're gonna wake up to an empty bed 
You can say what you want but you know 
You'll never get me outta your head

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin, baby 
Right after we fight 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 
Underneath the covers at night 
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes 
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh 
You're gonna miss my love

Left me a message, I really messed up 
Baby pick up 
Can't live without you 
All of a sudden you claim your ready for love 
Am I supposed to believe you 
Never want to believe, you'll say anything 
Truth is that you're incapable of change

One of these mornings 
You're gonna wake up to an empty bed 
You can say what you want 
But you know you'll never get (my love) out of your head, yeah

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin, baby 
Right after we fight 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 
Underneath the covers at night 
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes 
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh 
You're gonna miss my love

Who's gonna give you all the crazy lovin that I gave you 
Shook you, know can curl your toes 
Waking up the neighbors (like me) 
Can't nobody do it, baby 
Who you think you're foolin, baby 
What were you thinking of 
You're gonna miss my love, yeah yeah 

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin, baby 
Right after we fight 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 
Underneath the covers at night 
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes 
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh 
You're gonna miss my love

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin, baby 
Right after we fight 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 
Underneath the covers at night 
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes 
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh 
You're gonna miss my love

You're gonna miss that crazy love 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 

You're gonna miss that crazy love 
You're gonna miss my sexy body 
Underneath the covers at night 
You're gonna miss it
