Break up
Make up
Boy we goin' through this again
Is love
This tough
Tell me are you out are you in
Just my luck
I've fallin' in love with someone
But we don't agree
After all the arguing
You try to leave
But there's nowhere else you'd rather be

Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
Want this love
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to hurt each other
Boy it's getting tougher
Want this love
Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to play each other
Boy it's getting tougher
On this love

I love you
I love you

It's 2
Who knew
Who is it who's calling this late
Phone rings
I'm sleeping
Guess what he had to say
Couldn't wait
Bell rings
And all of a sudden
He shows up with another two
Kickin' it with someone else
Bein' kinda rude
Then he finds out there's no other dude
And he says
That's all that you had to say
To make everything okay

Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
Want this love
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to hurt each other
Boy it's getting tougher
Want this love
Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to play each other
Boy it's getting tougher
On this love

Baby oh
Am I losin' my mind
Cause for the first time
And it's not the picture I saw
And nobody understands
How I date my man
Want to say
And we risk it all
He must be a special one
Cause we thought this wasn't done
No one could have gotten to me this way
It's a special kinda love
Cause we haven't given up
Though I feel this way
From Monday to Tuesday

That's all you had to say
I love you
To make everything okay

Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
Want this love
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to hurt each other
Boy it's getting tougher
Want this love
Sometimes I love you but I hate you
Can't escape you
I don't think it's safe to
We go from bein' lovers
Tryin' to play each other
Boy it's getting tougher
On this love
