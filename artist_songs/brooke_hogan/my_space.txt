Initially initially
I guided you
But you're not used to a girl like me
Pursuin' you
Basically I knew that potentially
We would wind up together
Eventually

Here we are
Standin' face to face
Oh damn I just can't wait
To see what's gonna happen now
At my place
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Just be cool
No pressure
Let it do what it do

You got my space
You're in my space
I opened up my door to you
There's only room for to
Look what you're invited to
Now what ya gonna do

Now technically
We're not supposed to be
But we've been seein' each other
You pass my door
Beyond my livin' room
I don't think you believe in this space
No time soon
Now keep in mind
I gotta have my way
Don't be intimidated
Cause girls like me don't play

Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Just be cool
No pressure
Let it do what it do
You got it
You got my space
You're in my space
I opened up my door to you
There's only room for to
Look what you're invited to
Now what ya gonna do

Finally
Finally you're here with me
I'm so excited
I'm so excited
More than delighted
The right time
And the right place
You're in my space

You got it
You got my space
You're in my space
I opened up my door to you
There's only room for to
Look what you're invited to
Now what ya gonna do
Boy

So don't freeze up
Don't make me call your bluff
No pressure
I betcha that I'ma make you blush
You blush
So no pressure
I betcha
Boy I'm gonna make you blush
