Hips runnin' runnin' hot
Whips
What you want I got it

He was smooth like a wave cat
Coolin' in his ray bands
Incognito in the back of the club
I almost passed him
Then I came back
Asked him to explain that
Who you hidin' from
In the back of the club

He said I'm hot tonight
Wasn't lookin' for nobody
But you lookin' right
Won't you take a seat
And let me get up in your mind
Boy you kinda turn me on
I had to get back
Sit back
Then we had a chit chat

Ohohoh
Incognito
Away from all the people
In the back of the club
Ohohoh
Incognito
And can't nobody see you

Them hot hips
Hot lips
What you want
I got it
You got a hot chick

I was lost in the convo
Gettin' me and I know
We can't stay forever
In the back of the club
So we sped off into viper
Damn I think I like ya
Boy I thought i met ya
In the back of the club

He said I'm hot tonight
Wasn't lookin' for nobody
But you lookin' right
Won't you take a seat
And let me get up in your mind
Boy you kinda turn me on
I had to get back
Sit back
Then we had a chit chat

Ohohoh
Incognito
Away from all the people
In the back of the club
Ohohoh
Incognito
We be livin' it up
And can't nobody see you

Them hot hips
Hot lips
What you want
I got it
You got a hot chick

All alone
There are no other people
Cause that's how we do
Just you and me
Seems like there's been no one else around us
Since I met you
Take me away
To some other place
In the back of the club
We be livin' it up
Away from all the people
In the back of the club
Incognito
We be livin' it up
And can't nobody see you
Oohoohoh incognito
Away from all the people
Ohohooh
Incognito
In the back of the club
We be livin' it up

Them hot hips
Hot lips
What you want
I got it
