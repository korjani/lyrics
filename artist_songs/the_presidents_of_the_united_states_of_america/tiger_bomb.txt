Ooo, she plays the drums like a queen
Got the prettiest high-hat cymbal I've ever seen
I could fix a broken bass drum beater
If I had the courage to go up to her and meet her
She gives off sucha soothing vapour
Cooling effect she uses to smooth her temper
Wish I had all she ever needed to give her
Every time I see her I start to shiver
She wraps it up tight and she holds it in
Keeps a funny joke tucked inside her grin
Maybe its behind her wild eyes
Now I know why
I know that there's fuses inside tiger bomb
She is one target that is clearly out of sight
Tiger bomb
I know she's got something, ow!

Mama said that she was a big zero
She proved her mumma wrong at the big rock show
She kicked out a beat that made are feet get busy
A cloud of tom toms that made us all feel dizzy
Now its four in the morning and the show is done
Now I gotta be the strong one
Don't you know its going to hurt me to
Going the opposite direction as you

I know that there's fuses inside tiger bomb
She is one target that clearly out of sight, tiger bomb
I can't X-ray that shell to read her mind tiger bomb

I had to drop my tiger bomb
I had to drop my tiger bomb
I had to drop my tiger bomb
