I will survive in my Mach 5
In my Mach 5, I will survive
Yeah, Yeah

I will survive in my Mach 5
In my Mach 5, I will survive
Yeah, Yeah

I bring the hammer down
A tiny crushin sound
And I'm in the yard
Smashing match box cars
An itty bitty crash
And my machine is trash
But I'm blastin past
With chickie on the dash
Chickie on the gas
Go chickie

I will survive in my mach 5
In my mach 5, I will survive
Yeah, Yeah

I will survive in my mach 5
In my mach 5, I will survive
Yeah, Yeah

The firecracker blow
An urge overload
The wild plastic fire
Smoke from the tire
Layin' a little patch
Without a single scratch
Between the hammer and the rock I
Can see bright blue mach 5
It's my mach 5
Oh

Oh my goodness
It's the most beautiful little thing I've ever seen in my life
It's blue on the outside and all creamy on the interior
Yeah
I can't bring myself to smash it
So I take it for a ride on a sunny summer Sunday afternoon
I'm riding with the top down
Riding with the top down
Riding with the top down
Hell I blew the top right of my car

I will survive in my Mach 5
In my Mach 5, I will...

I will survive in my Mach 5
In my Mach 5
Yeah, I wanna go
I wanna go
I wanna go
I wanna go
