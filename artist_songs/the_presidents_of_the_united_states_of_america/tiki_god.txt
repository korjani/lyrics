Hey!

Had a girl and she did me wrong
I didn't let that kinda shit go on too long
Split the clouds and divided the sea
Showed that evil girl how nasty the tiki god could be
She didn't call no more nor bother me
My little tiki god made sure I'd live in peace
One day I read they found a body in the river
Tiki God, why you make me shake, you make me shiver, all right

I got a Tiki God... saves me... I got a Tiki God

Yeah!
Bobby Brady found the idol in the rubble
Had no idea it would cause so much trouble
When Greg tried to throw it back in the ocean
There was a rumble, an awful commotion
Don't ask me how, but the tiki found Bobby
He thought the idol was some Hawaiian hobby
Turned out the god was mean and vicious
Didn't respond to Bobby's 3 wishes

He had a Tiki God... saves him... He had a Tiki God

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

So when you're caught up in an evil plot
Your life's in danger and you can hear the shot
Your head is spinning and your fading fast
How long do you think this kinda fun can last
Your luck will change with a simple motion
I found my idol in a bottle in the ocean
He splits the clouds and divides the sea
And shows those evil guys how nasty those tiki gods can be, all right

He had a Tiki God... saves him... He had a Tiki God
Yeah
Yeah
All right
