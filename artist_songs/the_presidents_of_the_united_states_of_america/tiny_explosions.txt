Fire up the womantone
And drown the brown sound
Wire up the dynamite
It tore me apart
I had a lovely time
Lovely time
Lovely time

Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah

Hitch up the missiles and go for a ride
But don't forget to mop up the mess
It blasted me in two I had a wonderful time
A wonderful time
A wonderful time

Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah

Hitch up the missiles and you go for a ride
And don't forget to mop up the mess
It blasted me in two
I had a wonderful time
A wonderful time
A wonderful time
A wonderful time

Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
Tiny explosions
Tiny explosions, oh yeah
