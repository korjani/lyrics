The landlord's here to visit 
They're blasting disco down below 
Sez, I'm doubling up the rent 
Cause the building's condemned 
You're gonna help me buy City Hall 

But we can, you know we can 
But we can, you know we can 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord man 

I tell them "turn on the water" 
I tell em "turn on the heat" 
Tells me "all you ever do is complain" yeah 
Then they search the place when I'm not home 

But we can, you know we can 
But we can, you know we can 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord man 

There's rats chewin' up the kitchen 
Roaches up to my knees 
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau, yeah 
Til the rain pours thru the ceiling 

But we can, you know we can 
But we can, you know we can 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord 
Let's lynch the landlord man 
Let's lynch the landlord man
