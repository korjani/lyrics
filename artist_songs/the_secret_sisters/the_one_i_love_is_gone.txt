I don't know, I don't know
Where I'll go or what I'll do
It makes no difference
What I'll do without you

Oh, I love you, my darling
But I'll try and let you be
Goodbye, it's the last
You'll hear of me

Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing its little song

So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one I love is gone

Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing its little song

So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one I love has gone
