Time’ll tell the seeds I sow
Got into trouble but you just don’t know
You thought you had me
You’re wondering why
Whosoever told you
Told a dirty lie

Now I’m leaving, what can you do?
Who made you think I wanna be with you
I never settle, I never cry
And whosoever told you
Told a dirty lie

Already I’m winning the game
Your heart’s gonna break
And it’s a crying shame
A lesson learned a long time ago
I make sure I take it with me when I go

You’ll be alone when the sun goes down
Toss your name in the list and found
I never loved you baby
My oh my
And whosoever told you
Told a dirty lie
