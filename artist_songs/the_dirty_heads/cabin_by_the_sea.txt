Well come with me to a place by the sea,
If your ship breaks down, you can always find me,
And Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree ,
Our fans are always welcome with our friends and family.

And if you wish you can stay, as long as you please
Just lend a helping hand up at our cabin by the sea
Where everyday is beautiful, the sun, the sand, the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony

And we'll sing
Just as loud as we please,
And we will be,
Forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, i'll hang the tire from the tree.
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees.
Our friends are all around and the storm was a no show,
Said we looked better in the black and white photo .

What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo.

Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand.
We'll fill it up with wood and build a fire with our hands,
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine,
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey and the wine

And we can pass it all around, until it's all gone,
Put a message in the bottle, put the cork back on.
We'll throw it in the sea, the message it will read,
If you find this don't send help, send another bottle please!

And we'll sing but just as loud as we please.
But and we will be, forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me, in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show,
Said we look better in the black and white photo.

(ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Say we look better in the black and white photo.

And when the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to sit around.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire, start a fire.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to drink around.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire, start a fire.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to sing around.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire, start a fire.
