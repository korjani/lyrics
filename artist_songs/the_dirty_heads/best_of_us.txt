She takes my shoes off when I pass out in the morning
Dead asleep from a night out with the boys
If she came with us I'd have to send a warning:
She can drink with the best of us

She can smoke and she can drink as much as I can
She made me food and rolled a joint when I broke my hand
Fightin' with her older brother, showed him I'm a man
And she's as cool as the best of us

She doesn't get mad when I'm out of control
When I'm blacked out drunk, at the top of my lungs
Man she just laughs and rolls
She's my lady, baby I know this is always true
I see you yellin' at your girlfriend,
Mine's the shit, well how 'bout you?

She gave me head when we were driving on the freeway
Comin' home from San Clemente on a friday
We were laughin' 'cause her body was in my way
She's as cool as the best of us

Well she can rock and she can move it with me slowly
Nobody told me she can move it like that
I didn't see it, didn't buy it 'till she showed me
That she can drink with the best of us

Well she don't get mad when I'm out of control
When I'm blacked out drunk, at the top of my lungs
Man she just laughs and rolls
She's my lady, baby I know this is always true
I see you yellin' at your girlfriend,
Mine's the shit, well how 'bout you?

She likes the way I smell when I come home late
She tells me 'give em hell' before I come on stage
She likes her beer real cold and her whiskey straight
Stayin' up all night and then we sleep all day
But if the sun comes steppin' in early
And I'm waitin' for my wallet to be empty
'Cuz last night was next level, I was off my leash
I can still look at her with no anxiety because

She don't get mad when I'm out of control
When I'm blacked out drunk, at the top of my lungs
Man she just laughs and rolls
Well she's my lady, baby I know this is always true
I see you yellin' at your girlfriend,
Mine's the shit, well how 'bout you?

She don't get mad when I'm out of control
When I'm blacked out drunk, at the top of my lungs
Man she just laughs and rolls
She's my lady, baby I know this is always true
I see you yellin' at your girlfriend,
Mine's the shit, well how 'bout you?
