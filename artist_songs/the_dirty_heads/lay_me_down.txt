Well this is how it starts Two lovers in the dark
On the run, from the one That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side and bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty and They were nearly free
But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run
It's the two outsiders Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that
We could stay here,
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant,
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down...

Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move.
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriffs posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell.
They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night
Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight.
So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride.
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise.
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red.
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said.

I said I think that we can stay here,
Cause I feel our time has come.
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun.
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down...

Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you.
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do.
So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off,
And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off.
I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes.
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile.
I could never ask for nothing better than this.
It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss.

I said I think that we can stay here,
Cause I feel our time has come.
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun.
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down...
Lay me down... Lay me down...
