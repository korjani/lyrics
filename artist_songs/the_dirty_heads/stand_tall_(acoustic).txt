Say what you say or just sail away
She can't stand me but I miss her face
I feel like drownin' but the tides too low
And now I'm waiting for the undertow

So I stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the wall that we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can make it)
Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the wall that we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)

Well I can only take so much
The pressure may come to pressure us
They came to watch us fall
Oh yes, they came to watch us fall
But we will rise up against them all

So I stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the wall that we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can make it)
Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the wall that we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)

The part of me that fights you like
Gonna sing my song gonna sing it proud
No ones gonna bring me down
Gonna stand up strong gonna hold my ground
Tell me what are we fighting for
Just to do what we done before
Tell me what are we fighting for (fighting for)

Stand tall

Stand tall
It gets a little better
