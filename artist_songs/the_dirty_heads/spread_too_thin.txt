I, I'm spread way too thin
Everybody wants to know what's happenin
I, I'm spread way too thin
What's the big rush now, tell me why you're rushin

I, I'm spread way too thin
Everybody wants to know what's happenin
I, I'm spread way too thin
What's the big rush now, tell me why you're rushin
Why you rushin
Why you rushin

Well everybody's callin, but I just need some time
Yeah I just need some room to breathe again
A way to clear my mind
You don't need to be here
All up in my face
We need to find the right solution
To put you in your place

I said hey, I got a lot to say to you
Hear what you say it's not true
So this is what I'm gonna do
Look at me I'm gonna let you know

I, I'm spread way too thin
Everybody wants to know what's happenin
I, I'm spread way too thin
What's the big rush now tell me why you're rushin
Why you rushin
Why you rushin

Well this has got me twisted
In the worst kind of way
You put me down when I'm not around
And then you, and they you smile at my face
You don't need a home no, what you need is a cage
I've bottled up all of these emotions babe
A monster 'bout to rage

I said hey, I got a lot to say to you
It seems you got somethin to prove
So this is what I'm gonna do
Look at me I'm gonna tell you so

I, I'm spread way too thin
Everybody wants to know what's happenin
I, I'm spread way too thin
What's the big rush now tell me why you're rushin
Why you rushin

Let me breathe, let me chill for a while
Let me breathe, no it's not my style
Let me breathe, let me chill for a while
Let me breathe, no it's not my style

I said hey, I got a lot to say to you
Hear what you say it's not true
So this is what I'm gonna do
Look at me I'm gonna let you know

I, I'm spread way too thin
Everybody wants to know what's happenin
I, I'm spread way too thin
What's the big rush now tell me why you're rushin
Why you rushin
Why you rushin
