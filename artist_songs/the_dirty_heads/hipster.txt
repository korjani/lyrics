Well I'm so laid back, I'm my own worst enemy
Keep it all inside bottled up bad energy
Then I hear the sound of this musical amphetamine
Diggin' at my soul like the tracks full of ketamine
Never slowing down, fast forwards all I've ever seen
Pockets never dry, man, you can call me evergreen
Two bottles of wine, three teas, and some Vicodin
Every single night same thing 'til I'm one-eyeing
Always keep my shit locked tight no oxygen
If you don't believe me, go kick rocks with some moccasins
Couldn't find a hipster to fix gears on my rockin' man
Everywhere I go, I got the whole room talkin', man

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through

So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally

Said you wanna play this game with me, but you got way too much lag
Wish you had my gamer tag, wish I could be cut in half
Half to write your songs for you, the other half to spit your raps
Put this on my epitaph, I don't give a rat's ass
I don't even rhyme I just whine really fast
And I ain't got the time, I'm just sand in the glass
This time you shall not pass cause I'm the dragon Smaug
I'm a small axe move big trees you still play with Lincoln Logs
Why don't you go take a jog better yet go kick some rocks
Let me guess you got a blog, follow trends like it's your job
I prefer to be myself you wanna be like everybody else
Like a ticket, need some help gonna get scalped, Indian pelt

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through

So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally

This is how it's supposed to be, carried by this melody
Exactly where I'm supposed to be
My feet walk steady to my own heart beat
And I will carry on through the sounds of my soul
The love that we give will be repaid in full
All that we are is under our control

So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally

Endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
