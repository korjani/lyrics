When I get tired and a little lonely, the worlds turned it's cold back on me 
When I'm about to swear I ain't got a friend left to my name 
Instead of sinking a little lower I start making tracks on over 
To a place where the sun shines day and night and where I know I'll hear you say 

Come on in, baby take you coat off, come on in, baby take a load off 
Come on in, baby shake the blues off I'm gonna love that frown away 
Come on in, baby put a smile on, come on in, baby tell me what's wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone I'm gonna love your hurt away 

When I feel a lonesome night coming on, every thing I did all day went wrong 
There's a black cloud following me around and I just can't get away 
Instead of sinking a little lower I start making tracks on over 
To a place where the sun shines day and night and I know I'll hear you say 

Come on in, baby take you coat off, come on in, baby take a load off 
Come on in, baby shake the blues off I'm gonna love that frown away 
Come on in, baby put a smile on, come on in, baby tell me what's wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone I'm gonna love your hurt away 

Come on in, baby take you coat off, come on in, baby take a load off 
Come on in, baby shake the blues off I'm gonna love that frown away 
Come on in, baby put a smile on, come on in, baby tell me what's wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone I'm gonna love your hurt away
