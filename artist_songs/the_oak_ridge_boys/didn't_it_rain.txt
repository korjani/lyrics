The good Lord went to Noah and he told him about the flood
He said Noah build me a vessel and make it out of gopher wood
Build it big, tall and strong so it won’t be torn apart
Old Noah built him a masterpiece and he called it Noah’s ark.

[CHORUS:]
Didn’t it rain children, didn’t it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn’t it rain?
Oh didn’t it rain children, didn’t it rain, rain, rain 
Forty days and nights, didn’t it rain?

He had a moose and a goose and a gander
Alligator and a big hippo
A monkey and an ape, a couple of snakes,
A ram and a sheep and a goat.

He had a possum and a ‘coon and a black baboon,
Ann eagle and a red-tailed hawk,
A buck and a doe, a turkey and a crow
And a donkey trying to bark.

He had leopards, lions and tigers,
Bulls and a buffalo, 
Orang-utans and little bitty things
All lined up in a row.

He had a dog and a cat and a gopher rat
And a great big grizzly bear
A mule and a cow, a boar and a sow
He had two of everything in there.

[CHORUS]

He had apples, peaches, plums and pears,
Grapes and apricots
Bees and beans and turnip greens,
He had corn and baby squash.

He had a pumpkin and a big watermelon
He had every kind of wheat
And just before he closed that door
He grabbed a handful of mustard seed.

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

Lord, Lord, forty days and nights, didn’t it rain?
