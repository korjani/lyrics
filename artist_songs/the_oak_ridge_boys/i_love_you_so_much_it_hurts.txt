I love you so much, it hurts me
Darling, that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you

I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so

I love you so much, it hurts me
Whether near or far away
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so

I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so
