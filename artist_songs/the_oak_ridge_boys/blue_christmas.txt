I'll have a blue 
Christmas without you
And I'll be so blue 
Just thinking about you.
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear
If you're not here with me.

Then when the Blue 
Snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue 
Memories are calling
You'll be doing all right 
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.
