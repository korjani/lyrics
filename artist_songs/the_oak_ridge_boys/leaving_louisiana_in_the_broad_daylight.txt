Mary took to running with a travelling man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case, so broken hearted.
She say, momma, gotta go, gotta get outta here
Gotta get outta town, tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches.
Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go
'Round and around, nobody knows 
But the highway goes on forever, 
That ol' highway rolls on forever.

Lord, she never would’ve done it if she hadn't got drunk
If she hadn't started running with a travelling man
If she hadn't started taking those crazy chances, 
She say, daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelling' kind
Everywhere he's goin' such a very short time
He'll be long gone before you know it
He'll be long gone before you know it.

She say, never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight.

This is down in the swampland, anything goes
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close
It's the real thing down in Louisiana.
Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter goin’ bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana.
The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It ain't no time for lengthy speeches
There ain't no time for lengthy speeches.

She say, never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight.

She say, never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight.

Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go
'Round and around nobody knows 
But the highway goes on forever, 
That old highway rolls on forever.
