There wasn’t much love on the day you came
I was feeling my way with a heart gone lame
Life was so cold right then
I thought I’d never love again
Though my dreams of romance blew away with the wind
Oh my heart beat slow.

Heart of mine 
Can we try it one more time?
Can you help but love a girl so free, so kind?
Lonely tears helped me waiting all these years
For the day I felt the joy of love inside
When my heart’s alive.

Believe me I know that the truth sounds strange, oh yer
How an innocent smile made my whole life change. mm mm
You call it coincidence
But I knew she was heaven sent
When I felt that my heart was beginning to mend
Now my heart beats fast.

Heart of mine
I think we made it just in time
We can’t help but love a girl so free so kind
Lonely tears helped me looking all those years
And today I felt the joy of love inside
Yes my heart’s alive.

And growing stronger all the time.
Heart of mine
I think we made it just in time
You can’t help but love a girl so free, so kind.
Lonely tears helped me looking all those years
And today I felt the joy of love inside.
Heart of mine
I think we made it just in time
We can’t help but love a girl so free so kind
Lonely tears [fading]
