Daybreak pressing on the windowpane
No music playing no morning rain
Nothing but feelings leading me on
I'm just talking to you while you sleep in my arms.

[CHORUS:]
As long as I'm here on earth
Baby you'll be my baby.
All of my love’s in these simple words
Baby you'll be my baby
As long as I'm here on earth.

Life isn't perfect and never will be
It doesn't matter 'cause you're perfect for me
Through heartaches and mistakes, passion and pain
Down to my last breath I'll call your name.

[CHORUS]
Oh, baby you'll be my baby 
As long as I'm here on earth. 

Oh yes, listen to me now 
Just as long as I’m living
Just as long as I’m living baby. 
Are you listening to me now
Oh yer, just as long as I’m with you
Just as long, just as long oo, oo
Oh as I’m here on Earth, oh, oh,oh
Just as long as I'm with you.
Just as long, just as long oo, oo
Oh as I’m here on Earth, 
Just as long as I'm with you.
Just as long as I'm with you baby
Oh listen to me when I’m saying something
Just as long as I'm with you 
Just as long, just as long oo, oo, oo hoo
Oh yer, just as long as I’m with you.
