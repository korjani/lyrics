I'm sitting fancy free, because she was to go 
She's tired of loving me, she told me so 
I guess she don't know just how much she means to me 
But along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free 

Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still 
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will 
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world 
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free 

Oh lord you just don't know how it hurts to say goodbye 
She did her best to stay I can't say she did not try 
I just hope the road she takes leads back to me 
So along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free 

Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still 
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will 
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world 
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free 

Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still 
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will 
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world 
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free 

Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still 
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will 
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world 
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
