Lay your head down on my shoulder 
I won't let the night get colder 
I'll protect you, I'll be keepin' 
Trouble far from where you're sleepin'.

Until you wake in the mornin' 
You've got the world to yourself.

Dream on 
Dream about the world we're gonna live in one fine day 
Dream on 
Spent the night in heaven I'll be here to light your way. 
Someday tomorrow we'll smile 
But little girl in the meanwhile 
Dream on.

You're a princess chains around you 
I'm a hero who just found you 
'Til a brand new day must wake you 
Let imagination take you

Go where the music is playing 
I'll be along in awhile.

[Chorus]
