You told me that our love was forever 
But you never really meant it that way 
You said we had a sweet situation 
But I'm waking up without you instead.

Cryin' again 
We're out of love again 
Cryin' again 
Like we've nearly always been 
Cryin' again 
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again.

I thought we had a real understanding 
But you never understood what I said 
The magic didn't last like we planned it 
But we've wasted all the feelings instead.

Cryin' again 
We're out of love again 
Cryin' again 
Like we've nearly always been 
Cryin' again 
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again

Cryin' again 
We're out of love again 
Cryin' again 
Like we've nearly always been 
Cryin' again 
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again.

Cryin' again 
We're out of love again 
Cryin' again 
Like we've nearly always been 
Cryin' again 
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again...
