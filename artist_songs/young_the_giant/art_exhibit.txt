I, I saw a picture of you today
At an art exhibit on memory lane
You wore those pearls we found on Champs-Elysees
Framed like the golden masters
Forgotten all these years
Pouring like rain
A true thought appears
Oh, the genius of pain
Without a name
Pouring like rain

Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Words we had to describe the same feeling
Now without a meaning
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Looking at a hole in the ceiling

I, I watched the movie of you today
Silver screen
Adapted from my thoughts on Broadway
You saved the world
We lived in such harmony
Blockbuster sales in twelve countries
Remembered all these years
Falling like rain
A true thought appears
Oh, the genius of pain, oh

Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Words we had to describe the same feeling
Now without a meaning
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Looking at a hole in the ceiling
