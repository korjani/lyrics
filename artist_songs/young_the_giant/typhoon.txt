Over and over and over again
The tide carries
I give up my water and watch you sink in
Oh, the levy
At the night when the coastline breaks
You hide in the fallen waves

On the rise and the sights of typhoon
Washing by
And the rise falling in too
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again

Over and over and over again
(oh the sun, oh the sun)
I give her my water and watch you sink in
(oh mama, oh mama)
And night when the coastline breaks
You hide in the fallen waves

On the rise and the sights of typhoon
Washing by
And the rise falling in too
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again

Ooh oooh oooh
Ooh oooh oooh
Ooh oooh oooh

On the rise and the sights of typhoon

On the rise and the sights of typhoon
Washing by
And the rise falling in too
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again
