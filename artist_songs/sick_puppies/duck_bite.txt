Well you've been watching what ya think you like but I know what you don't,
You think it's all just playing fun and games, you treat it like a joke,

Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just your state of mind,
Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just come crashing down,
You better watch what you say,
You might get what your asking for one day,

Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just come crashing down,
(Where's your fucking backup now?)

Well I've been looking in your pale blue eyes, you don't have what it takes,
You taste a little bit, and you can't handle it, now your about to break,

Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just your state of mind,
Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just come crashing down,
You better watch what you say,
You might get what your asking for one day,

Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just come crashing down,
(Where's your fucking backup now?)

You better watch what you say,
You might get what your asking for one day,

Some people say they wanna be me,
This life can be real deceiving,
It's just come crashing down,
And where's your fucking backup now?
