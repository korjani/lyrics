I had a plan and it made God laugh
It didn't work, should've checked the math
I hit the wall 'cause I live too fast
I didn't know it could hurt that bad

I clung to hope when there was none
I should've known that was so dumb

(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

I was a dick when I was seventeen,
I thought the world owed me everything
But who I am and who I'll never be
Is all the shit that happens in between

(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

There's no going back,
When life's a loaded gun, you pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever

There's no going back
Fuck that going back
There's no going back
Fuck that going back

Yesterday was another life
Turning left didn't turn out right
Stuck in hell when I was twenty-five
You can't regret what you don't decide

I should have stayed, should have let go
Should've, could've means you'll never know

(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

There's no going back
When life's a loaded gun, you pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever

There's no going back
Fuck that going back
There's no going back
Fuck that going back

The future I'm living now
Is not what I'd thought it'd be
The person I was before
Is nothing like me
The future I'm living now
Is the way that I want it to be
The minute I walk through the door
I slam it behind me

There's no going back
When life's a loaded gun, you pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever

There's no going back
Fuck that going back
There's no going back
Fuck that going back
