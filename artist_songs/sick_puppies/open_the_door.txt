Makes no difference, open the door

Take it all away, for a better day
But I don't like you anyway
Seems it's always just another game
But I'm not in the mood today

Makes no difference, open the door, open the door
Makes no difference, open the door
Kiss it goodbye

A bit of time passes and then we're on the evergreen
Hoping that they'll catch a glimpse of something so obscene
This bit of time, are you ready for your baby to die
Kiss it goodbye

Take it all away, for a better day
But I don't like you anyway (anyway)
Anyway (anyway)

We're in the bad sack every day
Holding it back to see your face
I'm in the back
Every night
Shut the hell up, just kiss it goodbye

A bit of time passes and then we're on the evergreen
Hoping that they'll catch a glimpse of something so obscene
This bit of time, are you ready for your baby to die
Kiss it goodbye

Makes no difference, open the door
Makes no difference, open the door
Makes no difference, open the door
Makes no difference

We're in the bad sack every day
Holding it back to see your face
I'm in the back
Every night
Shut the hell up, just kiss it goodbye (goodbye)
Kiss it goodbye (goodbye)
Kiss it goodbye (goodbye)

A bit of time passes and then we're on the evergreen
Hoping that they'll catch a glimpse of something so obscene
This bit of time, are you ready for your baby to die
Kiss it goodbye
