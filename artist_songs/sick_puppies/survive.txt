I've had too many days
Where I'm ready to break
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
So I ingest everything
'Cause I'm in it to win
Nothing but time on my side
Anywhere I choose
'Cause I wasn't built to lose
And you think I'm going to fall
Face down on the floor
Just because I'm
High high

As for me
I have to disagree

'Cause I'm one who will survive
The ones you eat alive
And nobody puts up a fight
They die!
They die!
Rolling dollar bills
And popping all these pills
But I'll do what I wanna do
'Cause I wasn't built to lose

You keep making the rounds
You push me to the ground
Making you feel bigger than real
But I'm so fucking sick of your face
I'm not running a race
I'm running away
I'm running away
While everybody else
Is happy on the shelf
And I want it messily wrestling everything down
Everything down
Down, down

As for I,
I'm way too fucking high

'Cause I'm one who will survive
The ones you eat alive
And nobody puts up a fight
They die!
They die!
Rolling dollar bills
And popping all these pills
But I'll do what I wanna do
'Cause I wasn't built to lose

There has gotta be more [4x]

'Cause I'm one who will survive
The ones you eat alive
And nobody puts up a fight
They die!
They die!
Rolling dollar bills
And popping all these pills
But I'll do what I wanna do
'Cause I wasn't built to lose

Now break this fucking place, go!
I'm so sick of your face
I'm not running a race
I'm running away
I'm running away, away
I'm so sick of your face
I'm not running a race
I'm running away
I'm running away, away
