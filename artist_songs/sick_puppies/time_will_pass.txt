Your closed off from all the light
You haven't got the will to fight
You'll drown yourself in your sorrow
And push yourself until you get sick

When everything is all around
You wont bother to make a sound
Your too impatient to sit and wait

So listen to the knockin' on the door
It sounds so big its hard to ignore
Just listen to your friends as they try
Your watching the days go by

Time will pass and you will corrode
You will not know which is the road 
Or journey your supposed to take
The journey your supposed to take
I just hope you don't leave it too late

So heaven help me for what i am about to say
Heaven help me i seem to have lost my way
My way

So listen to the knockin' on the door
It sounds so big its hard to ignore
Just listen to your friends as they try
Your watching the days go by

Time will pass and you will corrode
You will not know which is the road 
Or journey your supposed to take
The journey your supposed to take

So listen in time as it passes you by
Inseparably till the end of time
Watching your days go by
Watching your days go by

Watching your days

Time will pass and you will corrode
You will not know which is the road 
Or journey your supposed to take
The journey your supposed to take
Yeah

Time will pass and you will corrode
You will not know which is the road 
Road
