I always give away too much,
Too much of who I am,
And when I don't get no returns,
I have to start again

And it takes time,
To collect every little speck that makes me whole,
It's a hard knock life,
But I know just what'll give me that push to make it home

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would

I know that things will never change,
I'll always be a fool for fairytales,
Yes I'm a hopeful kind of dame,
So I need you when things fail

Oh you know who,
Will leave you nothing but those heavy aches and pains,
But I can rely on you,
To give me something that no one can take away

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would

You do what no man can, no man can,
They'll leave me in the ocean,
And you'll pull me back to land,
You do what no man, no man can,
They'll leave me in the ocean,
Fragile and broken,
When you throw the rope in

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would
