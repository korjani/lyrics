Can't believe I'm leaving
Got my boxes by the door
Sorting through my memories
Cross legged on the floor
My diaries and scrapbooks
Oh they seem to take me there
I was always Posh Spice
And you wore zigzags in your hair

Would you know me know me know me
If you saw me saw me saw me
Nothing but hopes and live in the moment
Where we were meant to be
Oh those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking through my old polaroid photographs
Me and you you always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little [x2]
Just like Malcolm in the Middle
That was big when I was little

Oh this box is haunting me I can't throw it away
School reports and birthday cards seems like yesterday
Clip on diamantes makes me think of Friday nights
Leaving after class with me on the back of your bike

Would you know me know me know me
If you saw me saw me saw me
Nothing but hopes and live in the moment
Where we were meant to be
Oh those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking through my old polaroid photographs
Me and you you always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little [x2]
Just like Malcolm in the Middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little [x2]
Like Nirvana and Lauryn Hill
They were big when I was little

Super nintendo and club nights at bagleys
Smirnoff Ice, open mic nights, and acne
Wonder where you ended up
Cause I just can't thank you enough
Avirex jackets and strawberry ribena
Nike TN's Dreams of Wembley Arena ah

Oh those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking through my old polaroid photographs
Me and you you always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little [x2]
Just like Malcolm in the Middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little [x2]
Like Nirvana and Lauryn Hill
They were big when I was little
