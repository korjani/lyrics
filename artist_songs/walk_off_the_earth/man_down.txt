I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh Why Oh Why
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm bout to leave town

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum
Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh Why Oh Why
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

Look I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh
What ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger pull the trigger BOOM
And end a nigga end a niggas life so soon
When mi pull the trigger pull the trigger pull it pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna what I'm gonna do

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bumm rum bum bum bum

Oh lord a mercy now I am a criminal

In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh Why Oh Why
Oh mama mama mama

In central station
