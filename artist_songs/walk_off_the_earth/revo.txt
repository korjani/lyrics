Close your eyes and take my hand
Throw out what the teacher said
The revolution's in my head
The revolution's in my head
Raise the mast and set your sails

Just say when,
Just say when,
Just say when,
Just say when,
Go!

I've got a fever that I can't control
I'm knee-deep and I don't even know my name
I forgot about it.
I'm on fire, I'm a burning coal,
We can't fight it 'cause we never sold the flame,
Not for love or money.

Close your eyes and take my hand
Silenced by the driving sound
The revolution's in my head
The revolution's in my head
Raise your fist, and stand your ground
Go!

I've got a fever that I can't control
I'm knee-deep and I don't even know my name
I forgot about it.
I'm on fire, I'm a burning coal,
We can't fight it 'cause we never sold the flame,
Not for love or money.

[x2:]
Hey hey, you know we're never coming down
Hey hey, you know we're never coming down
Hey hey, you know we're never coming down
Hey hey, you know we're never coming down

Say when...
Say when...
We're never coming down
The revolution's in my head
You know we're never coming down

I've got a fever that I can't control
I'm knee-deep and I don't even know my name
I forgot about it.
I'm on fire, I'm a burning coal,
We can't fight it 'cause we never sold the flame,
Not for love or money.

Just say when,
Just say when,
Just say when,
Just say when,
Not for love or money
Yeah, we're never coming down
