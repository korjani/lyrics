Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings 

I know a place that will take you away
Your troubles no longer remain from the day
I found a love there it's hard to escape
It cures me at night, but it hurts when I wake

There's no judge and the jury's at bay
Cause this is our house where melodies play
If worries still linger my friends and I say
Top up your cup and let's sing it all away

Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...

Sometimes people say don't burn your life away
But they don't hear this song it's just a holiday
From the go go go go I say no no no worries 
Here let's all just sway top up your cup 
Let's sing it all away 

Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh... carry you home
Oh oh oh...

The last call sounds, bartender says it loud
Just one more round before they kick us out
If you fall down I'll meet you on the ground
No worries here, let's all just sway top up your cup 
Let's sing it all away 

Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings

Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh 
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
And I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
And I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
And I'll carry you home
Just one more round
I'll carry you home
If you fall down

When worries still linger my friends and I say
Top up your cup and let's sing it all away
