Life is hard and the living's rough
But these are the times when you gotta stand up
Don't let them break them down or tear you up
These are the times when you gotta stand up

You can turn it around
You can turn it around

And I'll be waiting here for you
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be
I'll be, I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be waiting

Day by day might be hard to do
But these are the times when you gotta push through
Can't let them break you down or bend the truth
These are the times when you gotta push through

You can turn it around
You can turn it around

And I'll be waiting here for you
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be
I'll be, I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be waiting

Never let them see you break in the middle
Let your heart get too little or get lost in the riddle
Never let them see you break in the middle
Let your heart get too little or get lost in the riddle

And I'll be waiting here for you
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be,
I'll be, I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be waiting
