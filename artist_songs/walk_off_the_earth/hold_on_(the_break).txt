(Hold on to what you got, babe)

I never wanted it to break
I thought we'd put it all behind us
Ever since that day
All I wanna do is find us
Now I'm falling down
I'm falling down without you
So I'm calling out
I'm calling out to find you

You gotta hold on to what you got, babe
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
We ain't rich but we're worth a lot, babe
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know
Come on I love you like that
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
Come on I love you like that
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know

Even when I make mistakes
You would always bring me higher
We got caught up in our ways
Like the time we at the bonfire
There was no one else, no one else to run to
So I'm calling out
I'm calling out to find you

You gotta hold on to what you got, babe
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
We ain't rich but we're worth a lot, babe
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know
Come on I love you like that
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
Come on I love you like that
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know

Hold on to what you got, babe
Hold on to what you got, babe

I didn't know just how much I loved you girl
Until you hurled my heart and destroyed my world
When we're apart I'm a perm without a curl
'Cause ever since the start
You been the ocean to my pearl
You and I together tilt Earth off its axis
We make as much sense as a left-wing fascist
But when we locked eyes back in grade nine classes
I knew we'd be together 'til this life passes

You gotta hold on to what you got, babe
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
We ain't rich but we're worth a lot, babe
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know
Come on I love you like that
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
Come on I love you like that
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine

You gotta hold on to what you got, babe
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
We ain't rich but we're worth a lot, babe
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine, you know
Come on I'll love you like that
It ain't always greener on the other side, you know
Come on I'll love you like that
I wanna see the world with your hand in mine you know

[2x]
I love you, love you, love you like that
And I watched you walk away
I love you, love you, love you like that
Never wanted it to break
