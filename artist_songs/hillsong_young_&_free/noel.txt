The first noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Noel, noel, noel, noel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Noel, noel, noel, noel

Noel noel noel noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel
