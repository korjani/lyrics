[Laura Toggs:]
I love You, Lord
And I lift my voice
To worship You
Oh, my soul, rejoice
Take joy my King
In what You hear
And let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
In Your ear

All I have is Yours
Take my life Jesus
Let my heart sing
How I love You, Lord
How I need You, Jesus
Who I am, who I have, Jesus
I love You (You are everything)
I love You (In my life, take who I am)
I love You (How I love You Lord)
I love You (How I need You, Jesus)
I love You (Hear my heart sing)
I love You (Oh my God)
I love You (I love You, Jesus)
I love You (I love You, Lord)
I love You (I love You, Lord)
Ohh (So I sing, so I sing)
I love You
I love You
I love You

You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see

You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see
