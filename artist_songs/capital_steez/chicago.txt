[Intro:]
You mean to tell me that this is not music
I could fucks with this, I could fucks with this

[Verse 1:]
It's the mystic, materialistic misfit child of the imperial empress
Ever since birds flew, I been spitting this wittiness
It should be considered a sickness
Can you blame him for making an engravement
And leaving the game the same way that he came in
Say that we came this far from cavemen
How hard could it be to spark fire with a drumstick
If the flows that I'm spitting are far-fetched
I'm a' kick it regardless, they listen to nonsense
Digressive korrupt recreation in progress

No question if they raise they arms yet
So tell me can you smell that funk?

Got nothing but blunts and Mami with the junk in trunk
ProEra be the troublesome bunch
And they going remember that name in a couple of months
I got it locked on the indigo ribbon

Feel the rhythm as it's swimming out your stereo system

And I'm a' keep on runnin' with it
Yea I got soul, I was brought up by colored women

[Hook x2]

Shouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn

I remember I was on the outside looking in

Keep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin
So pass the pot and let me skillet

You comprehend, Do you comprehend?
I don't think they comprehend
Said Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win
So tell me if it's bongs or hemp

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2:]
The jazzy ambiance keeps me right where I belong
Ever since infinity and beyond
Lyricism isn't appreciated in song
And I won't dumb it down just to be business smart
Your beats cool but it isn't from the heart
And of course, your bars just don't require thought
You hear the lions roar every time I perform

A Deviant, Defiant to the lies of the art

My goal is to try to bring light to the dark
High voltage like lightning, I spark
Vanish, living in the eye of the storm
In a sense it's gone but my mind isn't lost

In reality, vanity is our sanity
Then we lose sight when we're trapped in sanity
Think about the two "I's" In Insanity
And read between the lines, it's more to it actually

[Hook x2]

[Hook x4]
