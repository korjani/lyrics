[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I only had two problems with females
Comin' off too strong and waitin' too long to move on
To save myself a heartache, Cupid gave me a couple of coupons
And told me not to choose a chicken head with Jimmy Choos on
It's a new day, women want Louboutin
Basic necessities, you heard that "Gucci Gucci" song
And if she do me wrong, I keep it moving on my quest to find love
Still burnin til my doobie's gone
I'm lost and trying to find my route
But my thoughts only inspire me to find my roots
And my conscious won't allow me to shoot
So I only value time in the booth
If that's fine by you, true
I'm trapped in my reality
When I look in the mirror, there's a bastard staring back at me
The last chance of happiness for my family
Cause momma's getting older and it's bringing out the man in me
I wish it happened sooner cause every afternoon
I realize another day is passin that I lack improvement
I think I'm losin it
Homies asking what happened to ya
This concrete rose turned into a black petunia
I guess that's how it's supposed to go
Fuck being emotional, I'd rather braggadocio
Drown in my emotions till I overflow with doper quotes
So take a hit of this and pass it off to so and so

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
Puff, puff, pass [x3]
Are you high enough?
I'm just getting fired up

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ]
I'm in it for the win cause these L's ain't doing shit
I guess I've grown used to it

[Verse 2: Jakk The Rhymer]
I need no reminisces of history
This the requiem for them hard times
We crush up mad trees in this memory trips down
Memory lane keep me steps ahead of them
I'm headed in the direction of anything that's elevating there
That's why I'm writing through the night
And momma when your son shine they ain't gon ever take our light again
Overpriced taste, we been hungry, we overdue
Watching gangstas in the tube, living like they showed me to
New Jakk city, so the whole clique paid in full
No cinema, but it's coming soon
I slow never and it's no wonder I'm in front of you
Yo, I rap circles around the globe like the sun and moon
Blessed, I was the son of a jew and the world knew
He only kept the gold wrapped round his tooth
Proof, damn, why do the good die?
Damn, pop why you leave at 49?
I'm graduating at 53 you should've help up
Still thinking about what my seed was gonna call you
"Granddad"? "Grandfather"? "Papa"?
Reminiscing riding shotgun listening to "Big Poppa"
Cause, see, daddy was a street scholar
I guess them knife wounds was mnemonic
My momma looking at me like the new Mahler
I'm hearing her, that black king make Brooklyn look like Nigeria
