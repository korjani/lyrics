[Verse 1]
Is it evolution or an evil illusion?
People polluting our minds, trynna keep me from cruisin'
They never call til' they see that you movin'
So I'm ballin' without stealing or shootin'
It's middle finger to the world now
And since I got my meal ticket don't nobody wanna turn me down
And before you woulda thought that it would hurt to smile
Did somebody call the circus in town [?]
My work is profound, even all my Pros found a balance
Growing up a fine young man like a stallion
I said I wouldn't use the Cali as a catalyst
But I'm still mixin' different herbs in the salad
Fly shit, bringing different birds to the palace
They want that extra bread like we serving up Italian
In reality we serving up our talent
I'm a serve 'em with these words of empowerment, BITCH

[Hook x2]
The evil of love is so subliminal
And the love of evil is so sinister
This damn nation is ran by sinners still
Middle finger to ya' pastor and ya' minister

[Verse 2]
The smile ain't the same no more
I looked up and the sky ain't the same no more
I looked up what the meaning of life was
And ended up with a fake smile and a light buzz
Right cuhz [?]
It went off like the light bulb
I might seem fine, but this smile is only plastered on
I'm in the skies and the flight don't last that long
They said you looking good, I'm glad to see you happy dawg
They clueless, I'm emotionally damaged
A lonely little bastard still growing as a man
With intentions of only common intentions
Cause as a kid my mind been trapped inside of a prison
And during lunch time
I used to sit inside of detention and study vocab
Cause I liked my mama's attention
It was more than just letters that I studied for embarrassment
Made me better than ever and lessened my speech impediment

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Dancing in the rain, so romantic
Imagine you trapped in a hurricane while beefin' with yo' companion
Both uncompassionate, Laughing at the half of it
But deep down you both wish that you were holding hands
I hold it down as a man, sittin' bitter in my pride
The lemons that life's given, heard the engine as I stride
The lemons less limited the further that I climb
Haven't shed a single tear but I'm hurting down inside
I know you got the cold feeling, that shit right there
Let me guess, it's bone chilling
I bust my ass in a restaurant that whole winter
Walking home bumpin' Cole with just a warm spirit
They say my father had a hot temper
When I grow older, I just hope to be alot better
But I don't want to have to grow alone, we can trade a chromosome
As it pours, we can dosey do down this road together
You thought that you was so clever, but ain't no such thing as forever
Forever, foreva' foreva' foreva' eva' eva' eva' [?]

[Hook x2]
