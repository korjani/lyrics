[Intro:]
Bout to one-take this shit, nigga

[Hook:]
Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream

[Verse 1:]
Illuminati tryin' to read my mind with a eagle eye
And the haze got me thinkin', why
We killed Osama and plenty innocent people died
We should see the signs, but we Stevie blind
No disrespect to the man or the legend, but
I'm sick and tired of askin' my brethren if
It all ends in 2011
Would God come through or would he actually forget us?
Cause, apocalypse is getting closer
But they're more focused on that lil youth sippin' soda
Fuck the sugar act, niggas out pushin' crack
And I lost my father figure because of that

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
So can I live? or is my brother tryin' to gun me down
Scuffle a couple of rounds 'til we hear the thunder sound
No lightening, clash of the titans
And after the violence a moment of silence
Cause I want mine the fast way
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay
And instead of stickin' up for each other
Pickin' up guns and stickin' up our brothers
So fuck 'em all, I'm comin' through ragin'
And I won't stop 'til Reagan is caged in
Mom tell me I should let the Lord handle it
The arm of the law is tryin' to man-handle us
A man's world, but a white man's planet
And the doors are slowly closing while we fallin' through the cracks of it
It's a shame that flippin' crack will be
The best alternative if you don't make it rappin'
These crack houses and trap houses are trappin' us in
And in the end we're gonna remain stagnant
I ain't havin' it

[Hook]
