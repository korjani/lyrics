[Verse 1:]
I'm green and inexperienced, dreamin' 'bout that chariots
Stay sparked and trade cards, he know that they be tearing it
On, I'm feeling grown when I spray my cologne
Got a mind of my own, but time's ticking too long
And I got a plan to restore the game
This shit was looking quite critical right before we came
Co and cane flow in that novacane for your open veins
All we need is something medicinal, torch the flame
Third rail skippin' over missin' track
Soundin' like the kicks and claps that filled the gaps for missing tracks
The third kind been real, we just missin' Jack
Food for thought, but I tossed the scraps in a doggy bag
Rehearsin' verses in my head, no iPod
Gave my life to Ja and still can't find a job
So what I'm grindin' for, to put these new Nikes on
Or to hide the scars from the eyes of God

[Hook: x2]
Is there heaven for us hip-hop heathens
Big Pop and Pac, even Eazy had 'em leanin'
We all children lookin' for a reason
What do you believe in, betrayal, treason?
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents that represent me

[Verse 2:]
Hey yo, Steez, lemme send you a track
I've been a fan for a while and I appreciate you hittin' me back
Cause me and you, we like similar cats, just tryin' to get on the map
And I would love to work with you and Jack
But I'm afraid it's not as simple as that
Cause the symphonies and melodies
Haven't been havin' the same chemistry
The disinfect is only addin' on stress
And it's hard for me to live up to what you expect from me
The yellow tape was a warnin' sign
It's hard to cut straight to the chase without a dotted line
And if I made that the bottom line
Then I guess the Khan hit rock bottom about a thousand times
Some people like to compromise for the dollar sign, but I had my mind aside
I told Jack from the get that I'm a ride or die
And I'd rather die by homicide
Instead of goin' out without a pride

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Presidents that represent me up on some G shit
Tryin' to stay afloat so long they got me seasick
It's been a good minute since we kicked it
And I'm still hopin' that you come home for a weekend
So I could kick it like a kid again
I was all constructive like criticism and Timbaland
But I remember back in the days
When we was goin' through that Torch and Excalibur phase

[Hook x2]
