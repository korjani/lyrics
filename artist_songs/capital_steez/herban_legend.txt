The Force will be with you... always

Look...
So I flip my phone
Missed call from the little pro
But I'm a have to hit 'em back cause my minutes low
Sittin' home, watchin' Worldstar videos
Got some sticky rolled, still higher than my tippy toes
Back to kirk, he said he kinda knew the weed
Usually, I'm the one supplying the group with trees
I can show you how I roll but what you goin' do for me
Hit the lab and produce a beat
Cause I ain't in it for the money like take 5
Take somethin' off the grape vine, twist it like gang signs
Or you could bag it and try to make your profit back
You could earn a couple stacks if you move an ounce of that
Big homies out, making they own gwap
When the time came, made use of them long socks
And then I met my man D from the barber shop
Lookin' for a place that he can cop
I said "Lemme indicate, there's indicas and cannabis sativa
But just be careful when you pass it to a cheifer
If you can't break up the mary then I'm a have to teach you
And please use precautions when you handling the reefer"
He was like "Cool, you know where I can cop an ounce at?"
"Shit I don't know but my mans got a power pack"
Word is bond, two O's from the stash and seven grams of hash
But that will cost about a stack
I never hit the block for the cheese
Won't catch STEEZ ever gettin' locked for no keys
Thought about it, since they got what I need
I could make a use of them extra pockets in my jeans
It came with a rocket and a beam
It guaranteed the profit for your lean, nah mean?
Fuck standing in them dead in restaurants
Hittin' free studios hopin' it will get me on
Evolution got me on a new echelon
Had me thinking I was the Louis Vuitton Genghis Khan
Johnny Appleseed when he chopped the trees
Got me thinking I should hit the loops and starts chopping beats
Hasn't been the same since the album leaked
Coming soon, and we need a new discography
To top it off these bitches is acting difficult
The one that let you smash 'till you get the cash, it's typical
And you thinking that niggas actually listen to you
I guess not and I just happen to miss the memo
It's like the real nigga turn to bitches in a minute
Turn around and tell you that you different
But I Remain the urban legend

So please listen
Please listen
