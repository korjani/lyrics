Soho nights were my favourite
They were the nights, so full of flavour
Fun was free, and talk was cheap
Drinks were dirty like the streets!

Soho nights were when you'd find
Those who would seem so out of their minds
Make-believing they were stars
Dragging at criss-crossing bars

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love
Soho, so there
So now we're done

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!
You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!

Soho nights were the times we
Reveled in each other's company
We danced like fools and acted like queens
Among the type with some red jeans

Soho nights were thrilling rides
The more fun we had, the more makeup would slide
The more the makeup would slide I'd see
Soho really wasn't for me

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love
Soho, so there
So now we're done

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!
You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long

Soho nights were so black and white
The color came throughout the night
The more we took, like everyone else
The more alive the both of us felt

Soho nights opened my eyes
I've become a hag by your side
I thought we'd last, but I was wrong
Soho boys don't keep ties for long

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love
Soho, so there
So now we're--

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!
You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!
