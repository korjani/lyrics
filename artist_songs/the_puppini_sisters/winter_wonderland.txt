Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we rode along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? We'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Over the hills lies a mountain of white
A heaven of diamonds in the lovely night

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? And we'll say no man
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town

Later on, maybe we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking, walking in a winter wonderland
