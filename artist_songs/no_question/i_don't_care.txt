Tell me what the deal is 
What's goin on 
Why ya peeps don't like me 
Said I ain't the one 
They said I live a thug life 
Jitterbug to the bone 
How they gon talk about me 
betta leave me alone 
It drives me crazy 
Cause they know that you're my baby 
Tryna make me ghost like Swayze 
But you'll 4ever be my lady 

[Chorus:] 
I don't care what ya momma say 
What ya brother say 
What ya father say 
I'm gonna love you neway 

I dont care what your mamma say 
or what you sister say 
or what you girlfriends say 
Im gonna love ya 

Ya peeps say they seen me 
Hangin out in the streets 
Swingin wit the project ladies 
And the ghetto freaks 
How they gonna talk bad bout my family 
Jojo, Ray-ray, kesha, and my cousin malik 
I'm there when u holla 
Whatever you need you gotta 
Sure nuff treat you proper 
Tryna be your baby dada 

I don't care what ya momma say 
What ya brother say 
What ya father say 
I'm gonna love you neway 

[Bridge]

I don't care what ya momma say 
What ya brother say 
What ya father say 
I'm gonna love you neway
