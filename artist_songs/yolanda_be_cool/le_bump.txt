Le Bump

I sit and drink Prosecco
Cause he said just let go
He left me beggin' on my knees
Please, go play some old piano
Something that I know I like I hate ya
You dirty filthy flea

Please, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play
Just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play
Just get a bump for me, put my mind at ease,
Bring the rest, my drink, my heart won't break
Just play

Let's play... Le Bump [x8]

I sit and drink tequila,
Say just how I feel-a,
Like stupid people on TV
Please, how could you turn the cello
Tired of all the chat-o
Again I play the music

Please, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play
Just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play
Just get a bump for me, put my mind at ease,
Bring the rest, my drink, I'm not afraid of all you said
Just play

Prosecco... just let go... Tequila... how I feel-a

Le Bump

Let's play... Le Bump [x8]
