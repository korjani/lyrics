I can see your face on the wall
I hear your voice and I call
I feel the weight of it all
Can't brace myself for the fall

In the silence I hear your fading call
In your eyes I see and feel it all
In my mind I try to let go
It's so hard cause you're all I know

You act like there's nothing wrong
You laugh when I call on the phone
Say it's time that I try to move on
That the life that we had is now gone

In the silence I hear your fading call
In your eyes I see and feel it all
In my mind I try to let go
It's so hard cause you're all I know
