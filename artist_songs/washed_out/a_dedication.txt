I forgot fools run
Between half the time I'm sudden
It's ok it's over 
Innocent 
I long for the other 
I will forget older after
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear

Try to move she's back
Try to keep from guilty now
It's ok it's over, mean so
I will fall in dark
I wont forget older now
Don't be scared 
It's oh-it's ok it's over
