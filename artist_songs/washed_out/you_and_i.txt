Holding soft, to holding back, to keep his own heart. 
All in all, you need to learn to let it go. Feelings for her...

For all you know. 
You keep yourself from rising tone, no future holds. 
Slowly look up, you're looking hard to find love. 
Low key, fatal tune. 

Hold me, you know this wasn't planned. 
Hold me close, you'll hold. 
Hold me now, to keep it all in sand. 
Hold fire, you'll hold. 

Under unnatural circumstances, I forget about your vain pretenses. 
But if you want to recreate the sea, another sky for me, I got you. 
Under unnatural circumstances, I forget all of your vain pretenses.
But if you want to recreate for me, another sky and see, I got you.

(Personify) 

So hold me, you know this wasn't planned. 
Hold me close, you'll hold. 
Hold me now, to keep it all in sand. 
So hold fire, you'll hold.
