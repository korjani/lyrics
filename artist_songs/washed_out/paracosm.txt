You're safe
It's over now
And we're all alone
Inside
Our sanctuary
Where we can get away
A place to run and hide

You're safe
The curtain's drawn
And we're all alone
Inside
In our special place
Where we can get away
Escape it all tonight

Inside 
We're all alone tonight
You and I
We're far away from it all
Inside
We're all alone tonight
You and I
Tonight
