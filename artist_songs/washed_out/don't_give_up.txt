It's been so long
Since we said goodbye
Too much that went wrong
Has led us far apart

I was still surprised when I caught your eye after all this time
And it took me back to the times we had

[Chorus:]
Even though that we're far apart
We've come so close and it feels so right
Don't give up
Even though that we're far apart
We've come so close and it feels so right
Don't give up

Our life is over
It's all been left behind
So many choices
Separate us now

I was still surprised when we met that night after all this time
And it took me back to the times we had

[Chorus x3]
