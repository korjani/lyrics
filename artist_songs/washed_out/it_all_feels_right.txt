Leaving heading eastbound
Weekend’s almost here now
It’s getting warmer outside
It all feels right
Call your friends, I’ll call mine
We’ll head out for a long ride
Sun is coming out now
It all feels right

Close my eyes
Think about the old times
What’s it all about?
The feeling when it all works out

We’ll be gone for a few nights
Meet up with the old crowd
Music’s playing so loud
It all feels right

Close my eyes
Think about the old times
What’s it all about?
The feeling when it all works out
