Roll up your sleeves
We'll head out for winter I know
The nights will get colder

And I'll make my bed
Make sure I'm all fed and asleep
And Wake when we're older

Slower
But I can wait this out
Forming an orderly queue
Outside your house

Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait till summer
When you're warmer

Roll up your sleeves
We'll head out for winter I know
The nights will get colder

And I'll make my bed
Make sure I'm all fed and asleep
And Wake when we're older

Slower
But I can wait this out
Forming an orderly queue
Outside your house
I'm not even kiddin'

Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait till summer
When you're warmer

Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait till summer
When you're warmer

Stay calm [x9]

Keep warm
Keep warm
