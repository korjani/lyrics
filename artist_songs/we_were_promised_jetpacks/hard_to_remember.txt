With her elbows on her tables 
And her eyes lowered in her battle 
Should we carry on, when you're tired of your old thing? 
The one you see every morning 
And I'll keep on yearning 
You can't work and whine 
Your love is a mirror

It's hard to remember 
A colder November
Sink my teeth in to frustration 

If you've got boards why don't you use some? 
Get up early, pound those pavements 
You should carry on, when you're tired of your old face 
The one you see every morning 
And I'll keep on yearning, 'cause I'm always right
Your love is a mirror

It's hard to remember 
A colder November 

It's hard to remember 
A colder November

I led all my lambs, I led all my lambs to the slaughter 
They were gasping for air, for life, for death, or some water 
I now lead my lambs, I leave my lambs to the reaper 
I'll bait them myself of it means I'd be left with my guilt

I've covered my tracks well 
I'm safe for just now 
I've covered my tracks well 
With attention to detail 
I'm safe for just now 
But there's always some doubt 
I've covered my tracks well
