Moving clocks run so slow
I can't take my eyes off you
There's too many hands to keep my eyes on

Looking towards the light
Look a little tongue-tied
Sounds a little cross-eyed

The fast approaching midnight
We're locked out
We're fast approaching midnight

So, you take a little me
And I take a little you
We're all part of the century

Hold me down now, hold me down
A bitter disappointment
And I was restless, I was restless

You're winning me over
You're winning me over
Can't take my eyes off you
There's too many hands to keep my eye on

The fast approaching midnight
We're locked out
We're fast approaching midnight (woah)

So, you take a little me
And I take a little you
We're all part of the century
