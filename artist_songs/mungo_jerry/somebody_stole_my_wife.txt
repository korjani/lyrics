[Chorus:]
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife,
Somebody stole my wife, yeah they did
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife,
Somebody stole my wife,

I went away one weekend
When I came back she'd left me,
And I cried every night,
Somebody stole my wife.
I never thought she'd leave me,
Never thought she would deceive me,
But I was wrong not right,
Somebody stole my wife.
My nights are getting longer,
And my love is getting stronger,
I've lost my appetite,
Somebody stole my wife.
I can't get my boots clean,
You know just what I mean,
And my shirts are not white,
Somebody stole my wife.

[Chorus:]

"Have see you sing now"
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife, yeah they did,
Somebody stole my wife,
"One more time"
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife,
Somebody stole my wife.
