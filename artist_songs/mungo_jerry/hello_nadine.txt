I remember when the days were young
Summertime had only just begun
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Well we used to go out every afternoon
Swim together in the blue lagoon
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! now the nights are drawin' in
I'll be 'round to see you
No more days out in the sun
We got no place to go

Oh, I'll save my money and I'll buy a car
We'll go parking 'til the early hours
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! now the nights are drawin' in
I'll be 'round to see you
No more days out in the sun
We got no place to go

Oh, I'll save my money and I'll buy a car
We'll go parking 'til the early hours
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! Nadine, hello Nadine, Nadine, hello Nadine
Nadine, hello, Nadine hello, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! Nadine, hello Nadine, Nadine, hello Nadine
Nadine, hello, Nadine hello, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! Nadine, hello Nadine...
