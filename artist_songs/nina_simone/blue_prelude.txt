Let me cry, let me sigh
When I'm blue
Let me go way from this lonely town

Won't be long for my song
Will be thru
Cause I know I'm on my last go-round

All the love I could steal beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is Love but a prelude to sorrow
With heartache ahead for your goal

Here I go, now you know
Why I'm leaving
Got the Blues, What can I lose....Good-bye.
