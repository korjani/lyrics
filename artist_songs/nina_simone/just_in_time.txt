Let's go

Just in time you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Just in time

Before you came my time was running low oh baby
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you've found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day
