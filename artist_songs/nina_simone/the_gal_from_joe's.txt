Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away
And if you hear a song today
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe

Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down
That last long mile
They're sighin'
With all thei trouble and woes
They're Cryin' 'cause they all loved
The gal from Joe's.
