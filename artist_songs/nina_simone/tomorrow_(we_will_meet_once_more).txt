Oh she was a the fairest in Trinidad
And he was a wandering sailor lad,
But she stole his heart as no other had

Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there.

The moon was so young and their hearts were gay,
I'm yours for ever he heard her say,
But she knew in her heart that he could not stay.

Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more,
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there.

Now her heart is sad as he sails the sea,
And I heard her sigh, "Oh come back to me",
And the wind in the waves whispered mournfully,

"Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more,
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there."

Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
