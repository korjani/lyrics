Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue? 
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will

[Original lyrics]

Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Sine ev'ry one spreads the story
With his own little personal touch

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue? 
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memroy
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And you never will
