He needs me
He doesn't know it,
But he needs me
And so no matter where he goes,
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there

He needs me
I oughta leave him,
But he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his... And I'm here

And I'm gonna be his friend,
Or his lover
Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover that 
He needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know 
That I need him
Just as he needs me
