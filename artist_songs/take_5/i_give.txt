I've been waitin' all my life
For the moment I knew it was right
To make a promise, and give my heart away
It's a feelin' I just can't fight
I feel the sun, when you hold me tight
Now I surrender, everything I have inside

[Chorus:]

I give
My love , only to you
I give my love forever I do
You win, my heart
There's no holdin' back girl
I give

I've imagined how good it could be
An endless world of wonders to see
But, till I found you, it was only make believe
The words you whispered were such a sweet sound
With just a smile my defenses came down
And one emotion washed away all my doubts

[Chorus]

Everything that I do for you
Makes me feel alive
Everyday girl I promise you
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
