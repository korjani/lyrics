On the radio, on the radio, on the radio, on the radio

Radio station, that's where you came from
Mister sound of the summer and everyone is singing along
You danced to the beat of the drum
The memories made music, the music made memories
The moon in the sky and the hot summer nights that we partied
We stayed out all night long (radio tuning)

Pop me in a pop song (pop me in a pop song)
She pops me in a pop song on the radio
Every night you've been gone
She pops me in a pop song on the radio

Oh no, they'd be playing our song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, it keeps me on hold, radio controlled
Oh no, they'd be playing your song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, I can see your smile like it was yesterday

On the radio, on the radio, on the radio, on the radio

You left in the autumn without any warning
But the music still played through the wind and the rain and the summer
The summer lived on in my walkman
I wanted to hate you but I can't escape you
You're in every song, every song from the past
A ghost from the radio mast

She popped me in a pop song
Pop me in a pop song (pop me in a pop song)
She popped me in a pop song on the radio
Every night you've been gone
She pops me in a pop song on the radio

Oh no, they'd be playing our song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, it keeps me on hold, radio controlled
Oh no, they'd be playing your song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, I can see your smile like it was yesterday

I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, wired to the radio
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone but you're everywhere I go
Every night you've been gone 
You popped me in a pop song on the radio

Oh no, they'd be playing your song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, it keeps me on hold, radio controlled
Oh no, they'd be playing our song out everywhere I go
Oh there's a place, I can see your smile like it was yesterday

On the radio, on the radio, on the radio, on the radio
