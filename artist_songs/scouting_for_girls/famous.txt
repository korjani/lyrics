Staying in again on a Saturday night,
I'm going to settle on the sofa and turn down the lights.
I got 900 channels but there's nothing to see,
No wonder everybody thinks they should be on TV.

We all want to be famous.
Be a face on the screen.
Read our name in the papers.
Everybody wants to be on TV.

Everybody wants to be on TV.

Forget Audrey Hepburn, forget Bettie Davis.
I want to be known, just for being famous.
I can't act, I can't dance, I can't sing, can't you see?
But I'm young and I'm pretty and that's all that you need.

We all want to be famous.
Be a face on the screen.
Read our name in the papers.
Everybody wants to be on TV.

Everybody wants to be like James Dean.

I want to be the star tonight,
And complain about fame in a story I sell to the news.
I want to be the star tonight,
Want to make the front page as I pose for the boys in the nude.

We all want to be famous.
Be a face on the screen.
Read our name in the papers.
Everybody wants to be like James Dean

We all want. We want to be famous.
We all want. We all want to be like James Dean.
We all want. We want to be famous.
We all want. We all want to be on TV.

We all want. We want to be famous.
We all want. We all want to be on TV.

We all want. We want to be famous.
We all want. We all want to be like James Dean.
