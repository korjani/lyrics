Well you can ﬁght it but you know that you won’t get your way in the end 
Too many people, the King and all of his men
 And if you’re dealing a line of cards 
Won’t you take me to the queen of hearts? 
And if you’re trying to tear down what you see 
Pack up the stars before you come for me
 And if you’re dealing a line of fate
 Who’s going to tell her the reason I’m late?
 
You took her soul, so incomplete
 Why don’t you stop ﬁghting me? 
You’re in control so why should you be 
Fighting me? Fighting me? Fighting me?

How to be sure that what you say is the truth
 When I see ﬂaws in everything that you do?
 And if I’m passing a sentence on you 
I would give you the crown for a fool 
And now you’ve lost, there’s nothing left to defend
 You came so close to the King and all of his men 
And if you’re dealing in a trick of the light
 I need to see her face for one last time

You took her soul, so incomplete 
Why don’t you stop ﬁghting me? 
You’re in control so why should you be 
Fighting me? Fighting me? Fighting me?
