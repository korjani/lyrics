In the city
Where I'm from
There are lovers till the dawn
And you stayed up to see the sun
I couldn't wait that long

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

In the city
Where I'm from
Lions in cages just for fun
But you will pace around your cage
And wait for night to come

In the city
Where I'm from
They shoot you down
If you run

But we don't stop to check the time
'Cause time keeps moving on and on and on

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

I see you in another place
I expect a familiar face
The city joins us with hands of grace
Hands free there are no constraints
Just ignore all that you see
The illusion of you and me
Illusions come illusions go
And if I leave you'll never grow old

In the city
Where I'm from
There are lovers till the dawn
And you stayed up to see the sun
I couldn't wait that long

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

The city joins us with hands of grace
Hands free there are no constraints

Illusions come illusions go
And if I leave you'll never grow old
