When I thought it was over
I decided to leave a part of me aside
To find now I'm older
I wanted to keep my love alive
I walked my share of dirty streets
I held my head I kept my feet
Now I'm alive

When I thought it was over
I decided to raise a fire high
At night and I screamed out
I started to feel my love had died
And when that shadow smothered me
You found me lost I could not breathe
But I survived

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no

And when I thought it was over
You alighted to reach a part of me inside
The night that I screamed out
You started to bring me back to life
A stream that led me to the sea
A light I chased in front of me
Now I'm alive

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no

Ooh, and when the days felt long
Ooh, I'd never felt so wrong

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no

Ooh, and when the days felt long
Ooh, I'd never felt so wrong
