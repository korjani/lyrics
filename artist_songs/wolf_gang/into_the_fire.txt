Sit back in the seats if you don't want to go
Cause the lights are out tonight
But you will see our style burning in the sky 
As we set the town on fire

We want to shake up the people
They've been sleeping for too long
And the whispers from the spirits 
of the men who drew that dawn

Now is our chance
Now is our chance
And we can dance into the fire

There are marks on the street of the way to go
If you feel they did you wrong

And so tonight is your chance
For in the hour you may not live that ling
We have a message to inspire
The loneliest of souls

When the town is on fire
The world will hear our call

Now is our chance
Now is our chance
And we can dance into the fire

Now is our chance
Now is our chance
And we can dance into the fire

Now is our chance
Now is our chance
And we can dance, and we can dance into the fire

Now is our chance
And we can dance into the fire

Now is our chance
And we can dance into the fire
