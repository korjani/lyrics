If you're the chosen one,
How does it feel to be loved by no one
If you're the number 1,
Where do you run to can you hide behind the sun
And you hide there with your demons and you wait for night to come

They say that there's no oxygen again
You're forcing down the lies but you always get your way
Something tells me this was all arranged
You trick me once again

They call you Lucifer
The fires are burning and you look the other way
I saw the funeral
I watch the devil as he dances round me
But he dances with the fever
And spreads the plague of war

They say that there's no oxygen again
You're forcing down the lies but you always get your way
Something tells me this was all arranged
You trick me once again

Do you really want to drag me down
And take me to the gates of hell
No more dancing with the stars
I did it all for you back then
And look at me now, Im half the prisoner
Half the man, this life is resting in your hands

They say that there's no oxygen again
You're forcing down the lies but you always get your way
Something tells me this was all arranged
You trick me once again
