I tried to move, I cannot see.
Yeah, you have got a hold on me again.
And everywhere I turned I saw your face, you made my world a pretty place back then.

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, yeah.

And in the day and in the night, nothing can recall your sight to me.
And I don't know why we didn't stay and leave like it was supposed to be.
Oh, now every time that I stand still silence sticks of rolling hills go by.
And in the night you see your face, but I will never know that place will I?

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Hey girl you got a hook on me, I tried to fight it but I could not see.
And if you ever want to come back to me, oh oh oh.
You're a strange girl, you've got a hook on me.
When the morning comes, come on don't take away this dream.
But if you ever want to come back to me, oh oh.

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Where are you?
Where are you?
