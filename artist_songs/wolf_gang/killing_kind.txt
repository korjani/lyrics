Strike two though you’re blackened and bruised
And you’re feeling brave now there’s nothing to lose
When all of the lights are focused on you
There will be no where to hide

So you open your eyes turn your back of the city
Never falter, just keep walking
And into the arms of the next sweet talker
Lovers daughter God give me shelter

Cause your love is the killing the kind
Yeah your love is the killing kind
Yeah your love is the killing kind
The killing kind

You reach the point of no return you’re on your own
You burn the bridge and now there’s no hope left of coming home
Friday nights when you came undone for a little fun
And you keep them wishing they were in control

So we open our eyes turn our backs on the city
Never falter, just keep walking
And wait for the arms of the next sweet talker
We crossed and God give us shelter

Cause your love is the killing the kind
Yeah your love is the killing kind
Yeah your love is the killing kind
The killing kind

Run to the lake now
Jump in the cold blue
We need a vow then
I will find you

Run to the lake now
Jump in the cold blue
We need a vow then
I will find you

Run to the lake now
Jump in the cold blue
We need a vow then
I will find you

Run to the lake now
Jump in the cold blue
We need a vow then
I will find you

Cause your love is the killing the kind
Yeah your love is the killing kind
The killing kind
God give me shelter

The killing kind
The killing kind
