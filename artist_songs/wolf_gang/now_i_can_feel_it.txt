Two years I held my breath under that water's edge
Under reflection, and pain
Two years I never slept too tired to lie or rest
Too tired to forget your name

I felt the morning for the first time since you closed your eyes
I never thought I could again

Two years have caused too much
This fog is not enough
I need to flush out the blame

Now I can feel it
Like the first day of the summer
Now I can feel it
Like the water in the desert

I saw your shadow lost
I heard it whispering
Calling and falling in shame
In your return of life, are you as lost as I?
Is your deception the same?

To keep myself from falling
I dreamt that you were running while
Walking through a pattern
Whispering a holy light

Drifting through the water
I began to feel the light
Slowly into water

Now I can feel it
Like the first day of the summer
Now I can feel it
Like the water in the desert
Now I can feel it

I gave a part of me unto the water
But, no one's there
I gave a promise to try to follow you
No one's there
Oh, no one's there

Oh
Now I can feel it
Now I can feel it
Like the first day of the summer
Now I can feel it
Like the water in the desert
Now I can feel it
