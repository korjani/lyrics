Through those gates no turning ’round
Lovers lost and new ones found
If stars should guide your life from mine
Remember me through better times

And I want you to know, that I need you to stay
Would you try to let go, if I stood in the way
And I need you to see now, there’s no where to hide
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life

Moving in through empty rooms
The times that bend the world to you
And I know you think I’m less at fault
But if I sink or swim I won’t give up, I won’t give up

And I want you to know, that I need you to stay
Would you try to let go, if I stood in the way
And I need you to see, now there’s no where to hide
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life
As the ghost in my life 

What do you think about that
Ooh yeah 

And I need you to see now there’s no where to hide
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life
