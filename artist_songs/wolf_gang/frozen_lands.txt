I was dreaming of the frozen lands
When we both ran across the sands
And our legs got stuck and we both fell to the ground

I was dreaming of the things we’d say
I was searching for a great escape
But the skies horizons all turned upside down

But if you feel the will to seize it
We could fall into the night
Grab the want to feel and breathe with
Cause your rush is all that I needed

I was dreaming of the frozen lands
Silence without the sounds
Free from the pain of all that I have found

I was dreaming of the things we’d say
I was searching for the words embrace
But the skies horizons all turned upside down

But if you feel the will to seize it
We could fall into the night
Grab the want to feel and breathe with
Cause your rush is all that I needed

Your touch is all that I needed
Cause your rush is all that I needed

No sleep, closed eyes
These tears that we’ve cried
Old dreams, changed plans
They’re lost in the frozen lands

New dawns, the deal
No escape from what’s real
I still feel sad
All that’s left from the frozen lands

But if you feel the will to seize it
We could fall into the night
Grab the want to feel and breathe with
Cause your rush is all that I needed

Your touch is all that I needed
Cause your rush is all that I needed

Cause your touch is all that I needed
Cause your rush is all that I needed
