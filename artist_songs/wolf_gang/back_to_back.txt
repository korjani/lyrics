When the whole world is sleeping
I still lie up in my bed
As I came round to thinking
That I don't want nobody else
I want to be with you
It kills me to say
That I want to be with you
That is just the way, it's just the way now

Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back were strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away don't walk away

When the whole world is thinking
That I must be depressed
The point that they're missing
Is that I don't want nobody else
I want to be with you
It kills me to say
That I want to be with you
That is just the way, it's just the way now

Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back were strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

Back to back, back to back
Back to back, and back to back
Back to back, back to back

Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back and back to back were strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away
