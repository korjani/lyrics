You run it over
Straight out the night
You come from nowhere and are caught in my life
I keep talking but there's nothing to say
It is decided that you will have your way
So dance to the beat now honey, yeah
Oh you dance to the beat now hey, yeah
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah
You whisper something that I cannot hear
There's too much music going on in my ears
My hearts moving up inside of my head
You slam the breaks but I'm already dead
You think that you understand
I've got pieces of you in my hands
And I'm trying to do what I can
With these pieces of you in my hands
So dance to the beat now honey, yeah
Oh you dance to the beat now hey, yeah
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah
I keep talking
Just keep talking
Just keep talking
You think that you understand
I've got pieces of you in my hands
And I'm trying to do what I can
With these pieces of you in my hands
So dance to the beat now honey, yeah
Oh you dance to the beat now hey, yeah
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
Just keep talking
