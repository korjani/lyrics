This is getting old and so are you.
Everything you know and never knew.
Will run through your fingers just like sand.

Enjoy it while you can.

Like a snake between two stones it itches in your bones.
Take a deep breath and swallow your sorrow tomorrow.

So raise it up and lets propose a toast.
To the thing that hurts you most.

It's your last cup of sorrow.
What can you say? Finish it today.
It's your last cup of sorrow.
So think of me and get on your way.

It won't begin until you make it end.
Until you know the how the where and the when.
With a new face you might surprise yourself.
