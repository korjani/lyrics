Girl listens to mom so she lights a match and pretends to sleep
While everything burns
Man drives nowhere
So he pressed the pedal, hit a few dogs
And felt good
Boy hears teacher's words
So he closed his eyes and stepped in front of a train

Woops! Sorry 'bout that
It's just an accident
Revenge
Nobody forgets
Chop it into bits
The bitterness is hard to hide
It smells like homicide
Just nod and say it's O.K.
You try to make the moment last
You broke it right in half
You die and have a nice day
The bitterness is hard to hide
It smells like homicide
Just nod and say it's O.K.

I can hear your voice echo O.K.
I lied-it's really the voice
Of the guy who kicked your head in
Look in the mirror
It seems you're shrinking,
Miniature and soon enough you are gone

Station
No one saw the perfect crime
I can't wait for the next time
