This is only a test

1, 2, what you gonna do?
3, 4, 5, twistin' your arm and your eye
You will buy

Step right up, donate a memory
To the bank of love, you loan your daydreams

[Chorus:]
BUY IT!
[x2]

Black Friday's come 'n gone

Buy me a future regret
A shrink wrapped fantasy, that I'll wanna forget

In the age of the mercenary
In the nursing home where river swallows the sea
That's where we'll be, with guns

[Chorus]

Into the age of scrutiny
And the grandest frappe
Well I ain't gonna pay
Trimming the tree, I can hang, I won't swing
It's only a test

[Chorus x3:]
I'll pry my seat
From the children's graves
Hear the angels sing

All the zombies walk on Black Friday

It's a riot at the salad bar
Predatory lenders
Safari mission is far but you paid for them
To kill your mom

[Chorus x2]

Kill 'em now!!

This is only a test
