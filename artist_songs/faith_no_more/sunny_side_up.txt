I'll be your leprechaun
Shamrock or lucky charm
(Whoa, yeah)
Tap-dancing all alone
(It's ok)
Dip into the sugar bowl
(Whoa, yeah)

Sunny Side up [x2]
Such a lovely way to start the day
Sunny Side up [x2]
Not the only way to fry an egg
Sunny Side up [x2]

I am just a grain of sand on your beach
With all of my heart
All of my Heart
A drop of rain through your hands

Rainbows will bend for me
Curvy
Honey bees will sting for me
Stingin', stingin'

Sunny Side up [x2]
Such a lovely way to start the day
Sunny Side up [x2]
Dance the night away like Fred Astaire

Come on ride my wave
Ride it all the way
(Sunny side up)
'Til the ocean ends
(Sunny side up)
I'll see you there
(Sunny side up)
