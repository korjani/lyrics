From the day I was born, I took the bull by the horns, and
gave you
plenty to scorn, well right on! Then you said in a song that

Introduce yourself (right on!)
Now two decades gone by and I know that's a long time, para

nada nunca. Cause I'm still the same asshole and I still wet
my pants
every time that I see your face (who are you?)

Introduce yourself (right on!)

Hey Mr. Enigma, Hey Mr. Bigtime, Hey Mr. Epic, What's going
on?

Introduce yourself (right on!)
