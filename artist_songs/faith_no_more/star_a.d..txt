Star A.D.

See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freeom

Star A.D.

A little joke that's understood
All over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over

And dying is dry -
Like a fact of history
And when you die, you'll become something worse
Than dead -
You'll become
A legend

We are forever
