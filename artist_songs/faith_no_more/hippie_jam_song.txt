To feel the heat of the summer time,
I'm gonna find me a summer job
To feel the heat of the summer time,
I'm gonna find me a summer job
I'm in good hands, won't you change my bag
I need some help won't you change my bag
Hallelujah, blah blah blah [?], put some clothes on wash those feet
That's about as funny as a bake sale,
That's about as deep as your pocket change
That's about as sour as [?]
That's about as thick as the hair on your back
That's about as easy as a [?]
That's about as bony as your bony as your butt cheek
That's about as [?]
Open this valve and change my bag
It's nice and warm won't you change my bag
