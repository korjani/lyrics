She looked at me and did the bosa nova
I smiled at her and then just walked away
then the lights came on and it was over
to my surprise, she wasn't a girl at all
so I packed it up and took to a rock show...
where you can feel the pulse getting stronger
& you can only hear the beat for so long
I asked if there was any way to stop it
No, he said, just smile and act as if...
you worship the very ground on which they walk on...
no way
a temporary absence of gesture
a hidden meaning known to everyone
a slight misconception of leizure
don't see how that could hurt anyone...I know...but
spirit, excellence, further down the road,
these are the tools you'll need further down the road.
so lets pack it up and take it somewhere special...
from a quintessential, existential nightmare
to a sanctuary waiting in the sun
