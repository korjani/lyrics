Tears fall....They scarred your innocent teens.
Love's fool....The company you envy.
Leaves fall....The seasons pass you by.
And you think, that maybe you can fly.

Serious fool....Relate your mind to a girl.
Crowds form....But think, smiling, of his peril.
Beautiful....The pavement isn't there.
But whats the last thing that goes through your head?

You take the elevator to the top.
The next thing you know,
There you are standing on the edge.
And all the flashing lights and futile cries,
Their left with you now.
Just close your eyes and take that final step.

Wasteful....They dampen your will to live.
Dice fall....Release pleasure that you give.
You fall....And take the whole world with you.
And will you even bother to look down?

You take the elevator to the top.
The next thing you know,
There you are standing on the edge.
The victors there to turn you inside out.
So he can hide me,
Before you find out what's inside your head!

[GUITAR SOLO]

You take the elevator to the top.
The next thing you know,
There you are standing on the edge.
Whats left is left and turns you inside out.
So it can hide me,
Before you find out what's inside your head.

And all the flashing lights and futile cries
Their left with you now.
Just close your eyes and take that final step.

Just close your eyes and take that final step.......
