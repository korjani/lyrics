I'd like to peel the skin off
This winter day
I'd like to burn the hair off
This summer fling

What love can do when love's lost
Grow overweight
And smile as if
There's nothing left to say
Wear the cone of shame

Town is quiet now
Like it's holding its breath
Stone marks the spot
You know who you are
They outlined it in chalk
Word to the wise
And the barman calls die

I'd like to peel your skin off
So I can see what you really think
Or if there is anything
Under that cone of shame

I'd like to strip the bone off
So I can see how you're really made
And see how you really take
Your special pleasure

I'd like to pull your wings off
Read your lines like a gypsy
Just as lonely as anything
So infinite

Cone of shame covering all
You're only happy when you're pissing me off
Cone of shame covering all
I'm only happy when I'm pissing you off
