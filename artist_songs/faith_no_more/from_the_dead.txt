Homecoming parade
Welcome home my friend
There'll be no more sleeping on this forest floor
Open heaven's door

Around you, 'round you
Around you
'round you [x2]
Around you

Comin' 'round the bend
Welcome home my friend
There'll be no more weeping like a canyon gorge
Hear your lion roar

Around you, 'round you

I can see you shining like a morning sun
Hear your lion roar [x2]

Around you, 'round you

I can see the parade
Welcome home my friend

We come back to history in present times
Watch your watch unwind
We've been turning mysteries to nursery rhymes
Sigils and more signs
Around you
Watch your watch unwind

Back from the dead
I can see the end

Welcome home my friend
