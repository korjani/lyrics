I started this
It's all for me
What's yours is mine and mine is mine
That's plain to see
So give it up
I've got to have
I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e-a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e-
What someone else
Would leave behind
And spit it out, let's go to waste
I claim as mine
You're my flavor of the week
I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW
Tall and reckless
Ugly seed
Reach down my throat
You filthy bird
That's all I need
This empty pit
I've got to feed
To prove I'm fit
A healthy man
I've got to be
Malnutrition, my submission
You're the master
And I take it on my knees
Ejaculation
Tribulation
I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e-a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e-
Go, Fight, Go, Fight, Go, Fight, Go, Fight, Win
