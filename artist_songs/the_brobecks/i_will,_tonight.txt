Honestly, I've not the foggiest idea,
Just what I'm doing here,
But why should I go?

I can't believe (I can't believe),
That our home is blown (to smithereens),
And at night the radiation makes it glow.

You see, I've been inclined,
To get you off of my mind,
So I will, I will,
Tonight.
Alright, yeah!

It's not so bad,
To be the only one left here,
Though the science may seem queer,
It's all that I've got now.

I can't believe that you left me here,
The sole survivor of the bomb that dropped from the holocaust.

You see, I've been inclined,
To get you off of my mind,
So I will, I will,
Tonight.
Oh no!

See I've been inclined,
To get you off of my mind,
So I will, I will, 
Tonight.
Do it again!
See I've been inclined,
To get you off of my mind,
So I will, I will,
Tonight.

The only trouble is,
You're gettin' hard to resist.
But I will, I will,
I'll take that little pill.
Oh, I will, I will,
Tonight.
