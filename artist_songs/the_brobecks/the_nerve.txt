You've got a lot of nerve,
I've got a little time.
So try to make it hurt,
It's nothing that I haven't heard a thousand times.

And you've got your little girlfriends, 
So here we go again.
See I don't ever care to know,
The parts of you, you never show,
You think a liar like yourself,
Could go and bother someone else.
So go, go away, take your things,
Leave today.
Finally get what you deserve,
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!

You've got your little campaign,
A dirty, little smile.
A snap inside my left brain,
It's something that I haven't heard in quite awhile.

And you've got your little girlfriends,
So here we go again!
See I don't ever care to know,
The parts of you, you never show,
You'd think a liar like yourself,
Could go and bother someone else.
So go, go away, take your things,
Leave today.
Finally, get what you deserve,
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!
Oh!

The careful, careful lies you tell, 
And the campaign that your body sells,
Is the careful carriage ride to hell.
Enjoy yourself!

And I don't ever care to know the parts of you,
You never show, you think a liar like yourself,
Could go and bother someone else.
So go, go away, take your things,
Leave today.
Finally get what you deserve,
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve!

You've got a lot of nerve!
