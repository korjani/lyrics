I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
My life's changing and I gotta face it
My heart's taking me to different places

I came to this country, didn't know a damn thing
18 year old and in need of planning
Thought I was ready, I wasn't ready
Guess it's me and myself again
Time to go make some friends
Find me somebody to keep me safe

All of these people and all of their names
All of this love and all this disdain
All of these seasons and all of this change
Dreaming of my paradise

I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases

Keep thinking am I gonna make it
Right now my life is changing
Too much for me to take in
Feels like the world is going crazy

All of these people and all of their names
All of this love and all this disdain
All of these seasons and all of this change
Dreaming of my paradise

I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases

All those [?] on myself, lost my mind at 2AM
Have nobody to turn to, had to call on all my strengths
It felt like it was over before it even began
Dreaming of my paradise

I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
I keep going through different phases
I stay going through different phases
