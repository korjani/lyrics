Follow me to the exit
I know what you're going through
You might not like what I'm saying
But you know exactly what to do
We don't need to be complacent
I'm not the man who's gonna leave you
I just wanna take you places

Cause I'll be there every step, every way for you
Every step, every day for you
I'll be there every step, every way for you
Every breath that you taking through

I know, love is a familiar feeling
I would like to share it with you
I don't wanna drive you crazy
It's just something people like to do
Well, I'm not like those others baby
Cause I see it, I see you baby, I see you
I just wanna take you places

Cause I'll be there every step, every way for you
(Way for you, way for you)
Every step, every day for you
(Day for you, day for you)
I'll be there every step, every way for you
(Way for you, way for you)
Every breath that you taking through

Now you know
Drawing lines on your skin with my fingertips
Tracing shapes, on my feelings, once again
With my hands, up and down your spine, in and out now
I just wanna settle down, and build you up

Can I build you up?
From my lips to your ears
From my lips to your ears
A message for you, for you
Left with the concierge
And it says, I'll be back
And it states
And it states
My love for you
My love for you
And it asks if you
And it asks if you
Wanna build it up
Wanna build it up

Cause I'll be there every step, every way for you
(Way for you, way for you)
Every step, every day for you
(Day for you, day for you)
I'll be there every step, every way for you
(Way for you, way for you)
Every breath that you taking through
