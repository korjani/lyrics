Warm, warm, your heart
Tell me, tell me

Put your hand on your chest where your heart is
Bring me into your soul where I wanna live
Baby you feel good, stay a while
You know you should
Know you should

I'll keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Warm, like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh

Take me out, show me what you want
Stay, for a while, let's get down
You know it's okay
We both want, we both want it
So tell me what it takes

I'll keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Warm, like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh
I'll keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Warm, like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is against us
Wanna keep you warm
Like you know you want to
Be kept, keep you smiling
Even when the world is a mess, oh
