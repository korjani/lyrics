It’s a difficult place when it gets like this, uh huh
It’s hard to raise a child when it gets like this, uh huh
Oh giving this my all was my only wish, uh huh
But, it’s hard to do you right when it gets like this, uh huh

[Chorus:]
Your wish, my command, uh huh
So go on, take my hand, uh huh
Go on, take my hand, there’s nothing left to do, uh huh, uh huh
We’re better off as two, uh huh, uh huh

It’s a difficult place when it gets like this, uh huh
It’s hard to teach a child when it gets like this
What they offering you in a place like this?
What they promising you when it gets like this?

[Chorus]

Brings a tear to my eye when you remind me, uh huh
How you came to my side and you stayed by me, uh huh
You saying I, think it’s time we made that decision, uh huh
It’s the type that you and me won’t even mentioned, uh huh

[Chorus]

Said I, I did it all for you
You’re all I thought of
(Oh-oh-oh)
Said I, I did it all for you
(Oh-oh)
Held my hand
What they offering you
(Oh-oh)
What they offering you, what they promising you
Cause I swear it’s not better than what I would do
