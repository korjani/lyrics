Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah
Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah
Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah

Can't stop the way that you make me feel, feel
Something about this just feels so real
Ah, can't stop the way that you make me feel (me feel, feels)
Something about this just feels so real
When you know that I (I need to know [x8])
You hoping, to mean it, tonight
So I'm hoping, that maybe, you might

[Hook:]
Cause you know I want to, I want to
But I just can't keep it together
And you know I want to, I want to, I want it to last forever
(Want it to last forever [x3])

Can't stop the way that you make me feel
Some things in life you just can't conceal
Ah, can't stop the way that you make me feel
But tonight, time is on our side, time is on our side
Some things in life you just can't conceal
So why, why don't we try? Why don't we try?
(I need to know [x8])
You hoping, to mean it, tonight
So I'm hoping, that maybe, you might

[Hook]

Oooooh, oooh, ooh
Oooooh, oooh, ooh
Oooooh, oooh, ooh
Why don't we try? Why don't we try?
