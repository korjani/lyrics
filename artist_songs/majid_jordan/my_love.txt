[Verse 1: Majid]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus: Majid]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

Why you want to, why you want to
Why you want to, why you want to

[Verse 2: Drake]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus: Majid]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

[Bridge: Drake]
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em, and line 'em up
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em, and line 'em up
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

[Chorus: Majid]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

[Outro: Majid]
Why you want to, why you want to
Why you want to, why you want to
Why do you wanna be my love?
Why do you wanna be
