Thought I knew what it was the first time I saw you
But I only found out when you walked away
Yeah, it's easy to fall into a cycle
Yeah, and it's easy to say that you don't wanna change

See we can only learn from each other
And we can only grow here together
I only know how to be myself when I'm with you
Yeah, we can only learn from each other

I know there was love opening to the madness
But even the madness can't keep me away
I always thought you were a person of substance
Yeah, but then when you left, you had nothing to say

See we can only learn from each other
And we can only grow here together
I only know how to be myself when I'm with you
Yeah, we can only learn from each other

We can only learn from each other
We can only learn from each other
We can only learn from each other
And I only learn from you

I knew it was love the first time I saw you
You knew there was love the first time we met
I'm losing myself, I'm losing myself, I'm losing myself
I feel lost in your love and my heart's in a place
I can't really tell, it's been so long, so long, so long, so long

We can only learn from each other
And we can only grow here together
I only know how to be myself when I'm with you
Yeah, we can only learn from each other
We can only learn from each other
And we can only grow here together
I only know how to be myself when I'm with you
Yeah, we can only learn from each other
