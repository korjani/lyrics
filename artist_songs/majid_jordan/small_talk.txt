I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I got things to say
I got things to say

I've already said too much
And I don't wanna rush right now
But I feel so far away
I don't want to rush right now
I gotta talk to you
Am I making a mistake?
Tell me...

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for her
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good

Please don't let me down
I wanna make you feel good
Please just hear me out
You always make me feel so...
Please don't let me down
This is something means so much to me

I gotta call on you
I gotta call on you
I wanna call on you
I wanna call on you

I've already said too much
And I don't wanna rush right now
But I feel so far away
I don't want to rush right now
I gotta talk to you
Am I making a mistake?
Tell me...

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good

Please don't let me down
I wanna make you feel good
Please just hear me out
You always make me feel so...
Please don't let me down
This is something means so much to me
Oh so much to me

Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down like this
Just hear me out
Girl just show me what I miss
Please don't let me down
Hear me out a little bit

(Am I making a mistake?)
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down like this
(Am I making a mistake?)
Just hear me out
Girl just show me what I miss
Please don't let me down
(Am I making a mistake?)
Hear me out a little bit

I don't know where you're going
I just know where you are
But I wanna end up wherever you are

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good

Please don't let me down
I wanna make you feel good
Please just hear me out
You always make me feel so...
Please don't let me down
This is something means so much to me
Oh so much to me
