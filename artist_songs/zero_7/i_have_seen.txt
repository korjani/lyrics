Old man there people stare
Thinking back to God knows where
Always back to where he's been
I have seen I have seen

Time goes so slow
Days come and go
But I know, yes I know

New born son
Life has won
Take this turn then he'll run
Run away from all that's been
I have done, I have seen

Time goes so slow
Days come and go
But I know, yes I know
