Have you ever wondered
If it smarts when your heart is ignored
and the sort that goes away?
Though I waited for you,
Oh, how I adore you.

You never saw my face.
I traced your path each day.
We will be always together.

Now I watch you bleed.
You had all I need.
How I love you so,
Now we'll never know,
If I can't have you.

I even did the research,
Went to work, learned to flirt,
Wore a skirt and faced dirt,
and, still you didn't notice,
You never focused on me.

You never saw my face.
I traced your path each day.
You never lifted your eyes to me.

Now I watch you bleed.
You had all I need.
How I love you so,
Now we'll never know.

Now I watch you bleed.
You had all I need.
How I love you so,
Now we'll never know,
If I can't have you,
If I can't have you,
If I can't have you,
If I can't have you.
