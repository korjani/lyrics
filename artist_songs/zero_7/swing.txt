Thought you’d be forever the same
When did you become so easy to change?
Can’t like who I won’t
No, that’s not true
I do know
Just can’t figure out how to pin down
There will be no unguarded kisses,
let go of my hand when they’re around
They say I’m unsound
But what do they know?
They can’t figure out how to get down
Soon enough I won’t care
stay in my arms, if you dare
You can’t romanticize
They are crazy
Will only let you down
Try to figure out how to keep you down
They’re all alone
I will keep you down
