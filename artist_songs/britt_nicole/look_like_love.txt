[Verse 1:]
Have you ever felt, oh
Have you ever felt like that?
Like you just, just rushing through life.
Like you don't have time for your friends or the world outside.
Well, I've been there.

We gotta slow down, take a look around.
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?
It's keeping you and me;
From who we need to be.

[Chorus:]
I wanna Look Like Love.
Be more than just enough.
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone.
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy.
If we're all they ever see.
I wanna look like, look like love.
I wanna look like, look like love.

[Verse 2:]
Let me be the first to admit.
There are days that I just don't have the strength to give.
Don't wanna stay there.

Looking at me missin' everything.
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?
Instead of doing nothing;
We gotta do something.

[Chorus:]
I wanna Look Like Love.
Be more than just enough.
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone.
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy.
If we're all they ever see.
I wanna look like, look like love.
I wanna look like, look like love.

[Bridge:]
If I believe there's a Savior.
Is the proof in me?
Is He alive and breathing?
Is He what they'll remember?
Is He what they see?
When they look at me.

Do I look like, look like love?
Do I look like, look like love?

[Chorus:]
I wanna Look Like Love.
Be more than just enough.
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone.
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy.
If we're all they ever see.
I wanna look like, look like love.
I wanna look like, look like love.

I wanna look like, look like love.
I wanna look like, look like love.

(I want to look like love. I want to look like love. I want to look like love. I want to look like love.)
(want to look like, look like, look like love. I want to look like, look like, look like love. I want to look like, look like, look like love.)
