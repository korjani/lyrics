I've been looking for love in another's eyes
Searching for water, but I come up dry
Thought that I could find
Happiness in the world's applause
Peace of mind in a worthy cause
Take me back, take me back
Go to trust in the simple truth
Got to trust all I really need is

[CHORUS]
You
I'm coming back to
You
The only thing I know worth living for
Will You take this heart and make it more like
You
I give it back to You
It's obvious no one could love me more
I'm Yours
I'm coming back, yeah
I'm coming, coming back

To joy that speaks to my deepest need
To arms never far out of reach
Yeah, how Your love it
Calls to me when I lose my way
Holds me close when I feel afraid
Take me back, take me back
Got to trust that I'm safe and sound
Got to trust that it all comes down to

[CHORUS]

So no more getting caught in the middle
No more waiting for what is unsure
Back to Your love so true and so simple
Don't understate it or complicate it
It's so simple, yeah, it's so simple

It's You
I'm coming back to
You
The only thing I know worth living for
Will You take this heart and make it more like
You
I give it back to You
It's obvious no one could love me more
I'm Yours
I'm coming, coming back
You
I'm coming back to
You
The only thing I know worth living for
Will You take this heart and make it more like
You
I give it back to You
It's obvious no one could love me more
I'm Yours
I'm coming, coming back

You, coming back to You, You coming back
You, coming back to You, You coming back
You, coming back to You, You coming back
You, coming back to You, You coming back

I'm Yours, I'm Yours, yeah, yeah
I'm Yours, I'm Yours, yeah, yeah
