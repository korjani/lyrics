I see it everyday
We say it's only living
Like life is only pain
I see heartbreak on every face
Hurt we can't erase
Dreams that fade away
Like we're all just lost at sea

We need, we need an answer, a hope
And an end to the searching
We need, we need a portrait of grace
Just one steady thing
In a world that aches
In a world that breaks

Somehow before life began
You saw broken man
But You had a perfect plan
You would send your only Son
The Holy gift of love
And He would be enough
To erase all the pain of man

[CHORUS]
You are, You are the answer, the hope
And the end to the searching
You are, You are the portrait of grace
You're the one steady thing
In a world that aches
In a world that breaks

You are, You are the answer
You are, You are the answer
You are, You are the answer
Jesus, You are

And you are, You are the answer, the hope
And the end to the searching
You are, You are the portrait of grace
You're the one steady thing

[CHORUS]
In a world that aches
In a world that breaks
