Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric

Sittin' here just waiting for my cell phone to ring
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
My heart is racing faster than electricity
Cause I keep thinkin' about that night
And then when you held my hand
Asked me to dance
We danced under the lights
Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance?
Boy, you got it right

Cause we got that, electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true with you
Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know it's true
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true with you
Electric love

Now we got this power that's between you and me
Like lightning will light up the sky (light up the sky)
If we got each other we got what we need
Forever will be burnin' bright
Remember when you held my hand
Asked me to dance
We danced under the lights
Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance?
Boy, you got it right

Cause we got that, electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true  with you
Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know it's true
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true with you
Electric love

So tell me where you wanna, where you wanna go
We can fly to the moon and watch the world down below
We can sail into the open, we can sail into the open seas
Boy if I got you I got all I need

Yeah, cause we got electric, we got electric love
Baby, we got electric, we got electric love

Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love

Electric love (I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true  with you)
Electric love (Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know it's true)
Electric love (I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true with you)

Remember we were dancing all through the night
We took a chance and boy did we get it right
Remember we were dancin'
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance and boy did we get it right
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance and boy did we get it right
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance and boy did we get it right
