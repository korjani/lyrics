Dreams, they come
Plans, they change
Yea, we're gonna break
Yea, we're gonna break
Things we face make us who we are
Baby you're a star shining in the dark
Let's go back to the summer, summer when
We dreamed in love, let's go back again
Let's go back again
Yea, back again, my friend
To the summer when...
I'm holding a picture from seven years back
I smile at the memory, it's smiling right back at me, and I see
Brown hair and bright eyes, such a beautiful blue
A heart full of laughter with nothing to lose
That's how I remember you

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
And you fell, and it hurt
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl

Sometimes life don't go the way you planned
And we all have days when we just don't understand
Searching for meaning, it's not always easy
But your story's not over, it's still being told
Your sunrise is coming brighter than gold
Let's go back again
To the summer when

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
And you fell, and it hurt
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl

What if the picture is bigger than you see?
And God has you right where he wants you to be
Just listen to your heart
He's telling you with every beat
[x3:] You're still that girl

You were young you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
Don't you know?
Don't you see?
All you need is to believe
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
You're still that girl
You're still that girl

I see it in your eyes
I see it in your smile
You're still that girl
You're still that girl
