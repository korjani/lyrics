You see my anxious heart 
You see what I am feeling 
And when I fall apart 
You are there to hold me 
How great Your love for me 
Now I see what You're thinking 
You say I'm beautiful 
Your voice is my healing 

Without You I just can't get by 
So I'm 

Hanging on to every word You speak 
'Cause it's all that I need 
Hanging on to every word You say 
To light up my way 
Even every little whisper I'm 
Hanging on as if it were my life 
I'm hanging on 

And when the darkness falls 
I can't see what's before me 
Your voice is like the dawn 
Always there to guide me 

Without You I just can't get by 
So I'm 

Hanging on to every word You speak 
'Cause it's all that I need 
Hanging on to every word You say 
To light up my way 
Even every little whisper I'm 
Hanging on as if it were my life 
I'm hanging on

You know me better than I know myself 
Better than anybody else 
Your love is sounding like a ringing bell 
Oh, oh, I won't let go 

Hanging on to every word You speak 
'Cause it's all that I need 
Hanging on to every word You say 
To light up my way 
Even every little whisper I'm 
Hanging on as if it were my life 
I'm hanging on  

Hanging on to every word You speak 
'Cause it's all that I need 
Hanging on to every word You say 
To light up my way 
Even every little whisper I'm 
Hanging on as if it were my life 
I'm hanging on
