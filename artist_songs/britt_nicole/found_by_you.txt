I'm a little girl
And I'm just trying to figure out this funny world
It's so big
It's got me running around
I just wanna be found by You

Jesus
I just wanna be found by You
Jesus
I just wanna be found by You

See, I
I'm not ashamed
Of being small enough to fit inside Your hand
Take Your cup
And let Your love abound
'Cuz I just wanna be found by You

Jesus
I just wanna be found by You
Jesus
I just wanna be found by You

How will I know if I'm alive if I'll survive
Without Your Spirit inside to guide me
Alone You're making me strong
I'll never feel alone as long as I belong
To You and Your Son
You're the only One I'll ever need
And I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Your little girl
I don't have to figure out this crazy world

Jesus
I just wanna be found by You
Jesus
I just wanna be found by You
