I know that everyone's running
Just trying to get away (you, you can't get away)
Life can feel a lot like a rat race
Like everyday is so mundane
But I'm saying...

Hey, hey, oh, oh
I'm not getting caught in the undertow
I'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow
I'm never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll

Why don't you come on and join us
Take your nose off the grindstone oh oh
Take, take your hands off the keyboard
And put down the iPhone
And let me hear you say

Hey, hey, oh, oh
We ain't getting caught in the undertow
We'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow
We're never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll (that's how we roll)
Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll, Uh 

Don't fold under the pressure
 A smile can make it better
 Whoa, ya know, ya know, yeah
 Don't fold under the pressure
 A smile can make it better
 And if everything goes wrong
 Keep singing this song

Turn it up, make it loud
 You, you can't get away
 Don't, don't try to get away
 Turn it up, make it loud
 You, you can't get away
Don't don't try to get away, oh no

Oh no make it loud on your radio 
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll (that's how we roll)
Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll (that's how we roll)
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll
