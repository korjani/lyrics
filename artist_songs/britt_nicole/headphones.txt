She gave it her best 
She tried to fit in 
She tried to be cool 
But she never could win 
Her mom says she's great 
The kids think she's weird 
Honestly she wish she could disappear 

Why you try, try to be like the rest of them 
When you know there's so much more within 
There's only one you 
Here's what ya' gotta do 

Whoa, whoa... 
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 

He gets in his car 
He falls apart 
It came to an end 
And now it's breaking his heart 
He wants to give up 
Wants to try again 
Honestly he doesn't know what he's feeling 

Hey, you might not see it with your eyes 
But keep your head up to the sky 
The sun is coming through 
Here's what you gotta do 

Whoa, whoa... 
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 

So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders 
It's alright, no, it's not over 
Love is here, it came to dry up all your tears 
Oh, can you feel it 
Gotta believe it, gotta see it 
By your side in the middle of the night 
So keep your head up high and the dust off your shoulders 
It's alright, no it's not over 

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones 
Love, love's coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 
L-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones 

So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders 
Coming through your headphones 
So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders 
Coming through your headphones 

Twinkle, twinkle in your eye 
Listen to this lullaby 
The sun is shining in the sky 
I see love it's in your eyes 

This ain't the first time you felt like this
This ain't the first time, this ain't the first time
This ain't the last time you'll feel like this 
But it'll be fine 
If you can just, smile
