I know you, I know you
Don't think you're beautiful
Cause we don't look like
The girls on the cover of Vogue
But I wish I, I wish I
Could show you what I see
Like a, a mirror to a fine painting

You got it
A work of art
Work of art, whoa
You got it
You're a work of art
Work of art, whoa

Oh, I want you to go oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out loud whoa
Oh, I want you to go oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out

Comparing is poison
It's killing you and me
The lies of perfection
We ain't gonna believe
I wish I
I wish I
Could show you what I see
On the outside, on the inside
That's true masterpiece

You got it (you got it)
A work of art (work of art)
Work of art, whoa
You got it (you got it)
You're a work of art (hey!)
Work of art, whoa

Oh, I want you to go oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out whoa
Oh, I want you to go oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out
(You better shout it out, baby)

You were made for greatness
Beautifully created
By the one who made the stars
Baby, that's just who we are
Take back what was taken
All those lies are vacant
We're gonna tear them all apart
Let the truth invade our heart

Every freckle, every scar
You're a work of art
Baby, that's just who you are
You're a work of art
Every freckle, every scar
You're a work of art
Baby, that's just who you are

So go!
I want you to go oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out
I want you to go!
I want you to go, oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out
(You better shout it out, baby)

Every freckle, every scar
I'm a work of art
Baby, that's just who we are
I'm a work of art
Every freckle, every scar
I'm a work of art
Baby, that's just who we are
(You better shout it out, baby)

Let em know, let the whole wide world know
Let the world know, let them know
Who we are, yeah
Oh, woah
That's just who we are
So shout it out, go
Every freckle, every scar
Baby, that's just who you are
You're a work of art
