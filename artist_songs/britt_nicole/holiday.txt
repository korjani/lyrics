Here I go 'round and 'round again
Venti Chai, you're my closest friend
Lack of sleep is what I do
Starbucks will rescue me again

Work, more work, and somewhere to be
Skip the talk, can't you just text me
I'm goin', slow down, I'm on it
I'm going crazy

[CHORUS]
'Cause when it's work all day
I cannot escape
I just stop to think, and I'm going crazy
Take a break, hey
Sometimes you got to
Be still and breathe, baby
Here we go, better believe we can up and leave
Take some time and kickback
I'm on chill and relax
Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on holiday
Take my time and kickback
I'm on chill and relax
Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on holiday

Is this boy the one?
Are we meant to be?
What to wear?
Got to look pretty
Maybe I should go solo
Forget it, I'm ready to go where there's no
No more drama to mess up my flow
No more questions to answer, no
Pack my bags ya'll, I'm outtie
Flight leaves gate 17

[CHORUS]

Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock the beat
Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock the beat

No lap top bringing
Or cell phone ringing
You know the feeling
When hits you are singing
I'll kick back and enjoy
the sun on my face
The time of my life baby,
it's time to play
If you're ready for a holiday, holiday
Rock the beat, hands in the air
If you're ready for a holiday, holiday
Rock the beat, rock the beat, yeah

Take some time and kickback
I'm on chill and relax
Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on holiday
Take my time and kickback
I'm on chill and relax
Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on holiday

Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock
Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock
Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on Holiday

Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock
Rock, rock the beat,
rock, rock

Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on Holiday
