Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do recognize me?
Well, it’s been a year, it doesn’t surprise me
Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ‘I love you’, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I’ve been
But if you kiss me now, I know you’d fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

A crowded room of friends with tired eyes
I’m hiding from you and your soul of ice
Oh yeah, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
You’re a man undercover, but you’re tearing me apart
Now I’ve found real love
You’ll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special
