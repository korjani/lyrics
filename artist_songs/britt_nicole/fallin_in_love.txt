Over and over
Over and over

I've been thinking 'bout ya
Every second, day and night
Yep, it's something I just can't ignore
My heart can't hide it
Even if I tried that's no denying
Yep, nothing on the world I want more

I've got this feeling and I can't explain it
Can't explain it
You got me feeling something so amazing
So amazing
There's no denying that my heart is racing
This is crazy
I don't wanna run this time
I just wanna stay this time

I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)

I could stare into your eyes for a lifetime
Yep, the way that you're looking at me, 'cause
You stood beside me
Even when the storm was terrifying
Yep, you showed me what love really means

You got my hand and whenever you take it
You take it
I get the feeling like you're gonna make it
Gonna make it
There's no denying that my heart is racing
This is crazy
I don't wanna run this time
I just wanna stay this time

I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)
Cause I can't stop falling, won't stop falling
I can't stop falling (over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)

You say I'm beautiful, you do
You say I'm classic and cool
You say you like the way I dress
Like my hair a mess, baby
I can be myself with you
I think you're beautiful, I do
I think you're classic and smooth, yeah
Right now I confess
I won't make you guess, baby
I know I'm falling for you
Yeah! Hey! It feels so good
You feel that? Hey!
We're fallin' in love

I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)
Cause I can't stop falling, won't stop falling
I can't stop falling (fallin' in love)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (over and over)

You are my love
You are my everything
You are my baby
This love is crazy
You're the one I love
I think you're beautiful, I do
I keep on falling
I keep on falling
