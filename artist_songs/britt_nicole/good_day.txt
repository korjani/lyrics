oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Just when I thought you were gone
You threw it up in my face
Why can't you accept that I made a mistake?
Let it, let it go
Let it, let it go

[CHORUS]
You never let me free
You're like a ball and chain
Take a piece of me and never hesitate
Like gravity you bring me down
And I'm not gonna take it, not gonna take it
Feel it, I can feel it, I won't take it, I can feel it
oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
It's a good day, to bid you good day

Will you ever let me walk away?
You keep reminding me of yesterday
You're so stuck on bringing me down
You should know by now that I'm not sticking around
Let it, let it go
Let it, let it go

[CHORUS]

Gotta let, gotta let, gotta let this go
Gotta let, gotta let, gotta let it go
Gotta let me go
'Cause I'm not gonna take it, not gonna
You never let me free
You're like a ball and chain
Take a piece of me and never hesitate
Like gravity you bring me down
And I'm not gonna take it, not gonna take it
It's a good day
Goodbye lies, lame stories
Out my face, out the way, I'm warning
You manipulate, complicate, don't ignore me
It's a good day, to bid you good day
It's a good day
Goodbye lies, lame stories
Out my face, out my way, I'm warning
You manipulate, complicate, don't ignore me
It's a good day, to bid you good day

So say goodbye, don't try hello
It's past the time for you to go
I'm happy now that you're out the way
Can't believe, I played your sorry games
I've let you go, it's such a good feelin'
And I won't be seeing you again
It's a good day, to bid you good day
