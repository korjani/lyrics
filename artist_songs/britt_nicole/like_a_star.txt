Been working overtime 
And gettin' sick of these crazy games 
I'll be a satellite 
And wait for someone to enter my gaze 

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine 
Do you see them 
Like a star in the sky 

You got me falling for ya 
And I won't stop 'til I hit the clouds 
See I don't wanna hide these feelings 
Or even try to figure them out 

Sparks flyin' all around
Electricity
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet off the ground
No gravity
Fly with me, fly with me 

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine 
Do you see them 
Like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine 
Do you see them 
Like a star in the sky

Way up high satellite  
yeah
You and I identify 

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine 
Do you see them 
Like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine 
Do you see them 
Like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky 
And I love it 
Yeah, the light in your eyes 
And I wonder 
When you're looking in mine

Sparks flyin' all around
Electricity
Dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet off the ground
No gravity
Fly with me, fly with me
