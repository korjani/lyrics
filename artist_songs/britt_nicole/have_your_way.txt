Feels like I've been here forever
Why can't you just intervene
Do you see the tears keep falling
And I'm falling apart at the seams
But you never said the road would be easy
But you said that you would never leave
And you never promised that this life wasn't hard
But you promised you'd take care of me

So I'll stop searching for the answers
I'll stop praying for an escape
And I'll trust you God with where I am
And believe that you will have your way
Just have your way
Just have your way

When my friends and my family have left me
And I feel so ashamed and so cold
Remind me you take the broken things
And turn them into beautiful

So I'll stop searching for the answers
I'll stop praying for an escape
And I'll trust you God with where I am
And believe that you will have your way
Just have your way
Just have your way

Even if my dreams have died
And even if I don't survive
I'll still worship you with all my life
My life, yeah

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh

And I'll stop searching for the answers
I'll stop praying for an escape
And I'll trust you God with where I am
And believe that you will have your way
Just have your way
Just have your way

I know you will
I won't forget
Whoa, oh, oh
You love me
Have your way
Yeah
