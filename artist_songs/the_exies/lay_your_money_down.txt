Come
Lay
Your
Money
Down
Constant
Wave
Of sound

This is not necessary
This is not ordinary
This is my last confession
This is for my own protection now

Come lay your money down
Sick of this, i'm
Sick of hurt and
Shame is such a dirty word
Strung
Out
And
Falling down

This is not necessary
This is not ordinary
This is my last confession
This is for my own protection now

Come lay your money down
Sick of this, i'm
Sick of hurt and
Shame is such a dirty word
It's a dirty word...

We have no leader now
Punch the ballot
For the talking heads they sold
Like the cars, the pills, the booze, and the soap that cleans your soul
The tv reality shows you what's a stake

So cry like you mean it till the next commercial break.
And consider yourself for the wealth and consumption.
Me you say, i'm no spectator at the revolution.
