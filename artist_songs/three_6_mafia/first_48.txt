And make you buck like walk off in the back with guns out

Get rid of your flesh like if i was a vegetarian 
Fuck em fuck em feed em bullets 
let the ball bat carry em 
Till their fuckin fuckin family 
Then i'm gonna bury them 
I told them i was the king but they didn't wanna believe me 
Till the bullets hit em and they started to bleeding 
Boy you a lesser not even a guester 
When we started leakin up your shirt thats a guesser 
You realized that i wasn't playin with your plan 
You realized you have the wrong fuckin man 
Finally figured out that your on the wrong fucking land
