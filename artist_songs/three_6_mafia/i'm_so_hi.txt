[Hook: (Crunchy Black) repeat 4x]

I'm so hi', all i smell like is smoke
Yeah, that motherfucking green
Yeah, that got damn dope

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]

I fuss wit' the light green
I fuss wit' the drizzle hoe
I puts five to the tail
I smokes till it is no mo'
I fuss wit' this hotel
I got towels to the do'
I fuss wit' this freaky hoe
That's down fo' the dicky flo'
I'm blazin' this sticky, but never mixing it wit my coke
This one right here for the nose,
This one right for the smoke
This one right here for the dollars
This one right here roll the blunt
I'm taking six from the Styx
I'm wildin' like niggas stunt

[Verse 2: Juicy J]

1st you get the swishers
2nd buy the liquor
3rd buy some of that sticky, most smokers call it sticker
Can't forget the Newport, suckin' on my too short
Call my nigga Big Tris, bring that blow and snizort
I'm high ass fucking lizzy
I'm stressin' how I'm livin'
Oh please, oh please, oh please,
just give me just one mo' hizze
This hydro weed I got some
I might blow you a shotgun
But if you can't play hizzap
I guess yo ass don't want none

[Hook repeats 4x]

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]

Give me weed, give me green,
give me somethin wit no seed
Give me somethin I can break down wit
no sticks or unstamy
It don't makes no d if its ? or that bud
gently give it to me and my hand will gently tuck
In yo hand you receive is a big face from me
Tell my nigga pass me that swisher,
so I can roll up this weed
Get me fiending up wit weed
Put that joint to that sweet
Then my nigga looked at my me
Then we started to repeat

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]

Yo, I be smokin' out daily,
maybe get up on some hazey
Then remote and faded baby,
cause you niggas drive me crazy
Still a lady when I'm escalated
Faded with my peeps
Bobby Brown smokin' niggas know not to even step to me
When I'm high I ain't gone lie,
I'm feeling freaky up inside
You wanna keep it on the low
I put my truck on the other side
Nigga nigga what you mean Gangsta Boo be on that green
Looking good up on the scene
Posted up knowhat I mean

[Hook repeat 4x]

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]

Gone on the pills after ?
Yes I break out of the lot
Smoke too much hydro puff
I'm takin' it up a notch
Too me you ain't got to eat?
And the stranger thinks of me?
I'm paralyzed from the P
I'm shootin' up cause of thee
Bacardi for cocoa plex
I sniffed up an avalanche
I'm going in to a trance
The deadliest demon man
You thus as the Sosate say
Yeah pass me that saucer tray
Or pass me a blunt of hay
I wanna just drift away, drift away

[Verse 6: Koopsta]

I be smokin' on motherfucking weed
and chiefin' out
Hear me saying satanic prays
Let her suck my dick
Fo this girl drive me crazy
These niggas got me doped
Gotta blaze a blunt into me
Fo just take me to the chiefin' room
Fuck the city with the chicken
Chief the chicken, roll the chicken
Smoking got the chicken out there dirty,
with a lot of sticky
Hear me this and I think I blowed a pound
Now I seen me a little silhouette of mine

[Crunchy Black:]
Yeah that motherfucking green [3x]
Yeah that got damn dope
