I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I'm feeling fed up with this stress, it doesn't suit me
It's 'cause you're heavy with your breath and I'm a true fiend

You keep on coming, keep on coming til I don't know (Don't know)
Who I turn to (Turn to)

You give me nothing, give me nothing that I don't need (Don't need)
Cause you make me

And I have every right to run
Have every to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to

I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I'm feeling less and less impressed, I need a new scene
It's 'cause the story isn't ready for an ending

You keep on coming, keep on coming til I don't know (Don't know)
Who I turn to (Turn to)

You give me nothing, give me nothing that I don't need (Don't need)
Cause you make me

And I have every right to run
Have every to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to

I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I could never show it
(I could never show it)

I could never let you know (I could never let you know)

And I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to

I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to

I have every right to run (I could never show it)
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun (I could never let you know)
Have every right to

I have every right to run (I could never show it)
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun (I could never let you know)
Have every right to run
