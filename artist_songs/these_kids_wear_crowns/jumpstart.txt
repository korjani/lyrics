Broke. 
Ain't got no money, 
dont know where to go. 
Just sittin' staring at the stereo. 
I think we better turn it UP,turn it UP ,turn it UP 

Loud. 
Cause lately I've been feeling kind of low. 
Let's blow the speakers on the radio; 
Cause tonight we're gonna' 
break it DOWN,break it DOWN break it DOWN. 
We gotta' get up off of the ground ! 

[Chorus:]
We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO.! 
What's up, when we get it going 
No way we're gonna stop. 
And all you need is a SPARK,SPARK 
If it's all that you got! 
GOT,GOT,GOT,GOT 
-We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO 
What's up ? We're gonna dance until our L-L-LEGS 
Go into shock ! 
Like an adrenaline SHOT, SHOT going straight to the HEART HEART.
Heart,heart,heart,heart. 
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A JUMP ! 
Whoa,Oh,Eh,Oh [x5] 
HEY ! 
We're gonna give it a jump.! 

Dreams. 
We got enough that we can fill the tank 
And even if we gotta' break the bank; 
You know we're gonna TURN IT UP,TURN IT UP, TURN IT UP 

Time. 
Ain't got to worry bout' it anymore. 
And if they try to stop us at the door, 
You know we're gonna;BREAK IT DOWN,BREAK IT DOWN,BREAK IT DOWN 
We gotta' get up off of the ground ! 

[Chorus:] 
We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO.! 
What's up, when we get it going 
No way we're gonna stop. 
And all you need is a SPARK,SPARK 
If it's all that you got! 
GOT,GOT,GOT,GOT 
-We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO 
What's up ? We're gonna dance until our L-L-LEGS 
Go into shock ! 
Like an adrenaline SHOT, SHOT going straight to the HEART HEART.
Heart,heart,heart,heart. 
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A JUMP ! 
Whoa,Oh,Eh,Oh [x5] 
HEY ! 
We're gonna give it a jump.! 

Can you feel the electricity in the air; 
Anytime, Anyplace, it will always be there. 
When your heart stops baby, 
Heart stops baby 
YEAH ! 

[Chorus]
We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO.! 
What's up, when we get it going 
No way we're gonna stop. 
And all you need is a SPARK,SPARK 
If it's all that you got! 
GOT,GOT,GOT,GOT 
-We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART 
4,3,2,1 GO 
What's up ? We're gonna dance until our L-L-LEGS 
Go into shock ! 
Like an adrenaline SHOT, SHOT going straight to the HEART HEART.
