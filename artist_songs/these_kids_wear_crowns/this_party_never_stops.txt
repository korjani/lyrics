This party never stops. This party never stops.) 

We celebrate and never break, and we're gonna make it 'til the end. 
We got lots of time to spend so, we waste it on friends. 
We plan it out and see it through, and we know just what we're gonna do.
Monday comes and Tuesday goes 'til Friday night with you. 

So come with me, and we'll turn down the lights. 
Come with me, and we won't sleep tonight. 

Yeah we know-ow-ow that we got it. 
And we nor-or-ormally lose control. 
And we know-ow-ow where we started. 
This party never stops. This party never stops, no. 
Whoah-oh, whoah oh, whoah-oh. 
This party never stops. This party never stops, no. 

I fall apart but never break, 'cause you always pick me up again. 
I'm feelin' like I felt it then so, pick me up again. 
I never hide what I'm into, and I know you're gonna be here soon.
