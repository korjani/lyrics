This is the place we go
Where the lights turn low
And there's no misleading our true felling show
Let me know
And we'll take it slow
Cuz baby if it gets to cold
We'll set our hearts a glow

We wake up when it feels right
We stay up till we see light
We shout out 'OH, Let's go'
Until our ears ring but 
We won't stop till everybody's singing

We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
You said it yourself
Yeah we need this
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
Just like we planned 

These are the sounds we know
And the songs that go
And go on repeating through our stereo
So let me know
Don't turn it low
And baby if you lose control
I won't leave you alone

We wake up when it feels right
We stay up till we see light
We shout out 'OH, Let's go'
Until our ears ring but 
We won't stop till everybody's singing

We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
You said it yourself
Yeah we need this
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
Just like we planned 
Just like we planned
Just like we planned 

Just like we planned

We've got the style and no
Did you get control
So let's go it's likely
Yeah that'll do nicely
So stand up, lets take it to the top
We never gonna spin the drop
And if you need me
You just pick up the phone

We've got the style and no
Did you get control
So let's go it's likely
Yeah that'll do nicely
So stand up, lets take it to the top
We're never gonna spin the drop
And if you need me
You just pick up the phone

We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
You said it yourself
Yeah we need this
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
Just like we planned oh just like we planned

(Never gonna give it up, never gonna give it up, because we can, because we can)

We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
You said it yourself
Yeah we need this
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
Just like we planned, just like we planned

(Never gonna give it up, never gonna give it up, because we can, because we can)

We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
