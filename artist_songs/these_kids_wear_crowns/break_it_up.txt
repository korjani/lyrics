I'd like to see you on a big yellow bike, 
With two training wheels tightly 
Holding yourself as you break into the day. 
Now you're grown up, and you're far away, 
Far from reflections of youth, 
Of when you weren't dazed (It's a shame) 

So what about your princess? 
(So what about your princess?) 
Somebodys gonna save your day 
So what about your princess, 
Crying on the front steps, 
Nobodys gonna come and save your day 

Say way your way (way your way) 
Save your day 
Say way your way (way your way) 
Save your day 

[CHORUS x2:] 
Break, 
Break, 
Break, 
Break it up 
Shake, 
Shake, 
Shake, 
Shake it up 
We know, 
We know you all too well 

We know you all too well 

I'd like to see you sailing high like a kite, 
With no strings holding you tightly, 
As you float above where you would never stray, 
But now you're gone and you're far away, 
Far from every birds eyes view, 
Of when you were caged (it's a shame) 

So what about your princess? (So what about your princess?) 
Somebodys gonna save your day (WOAH) 
So what about your princess, 
Crying on the front steps, 
Nobodys gonna come and save your day 

Say way your way (way your way) 
Save your day 
Say way your way (way your way) 
Save your day 

[CHORUS x2] 

Things would always look better, 
Once I finally get her view down from the top 
I get a view down from the top 
(WOAH OH OH) 

[CHORUS] 

On and on, 
Around it goes and back again, 
I'm learning when to know to throw the towel in, 
On and on, 
Around it goes and back again, 
I'm learning when, so I'm all in 
HEY! HEY! HEY! 

[CHORUS x3] 

Things already look better, 
Things already look better, better (YEAH) 
We know you all too well. 

[CHORUS]

BREAK, BREAK, BREAK, IT UP!
