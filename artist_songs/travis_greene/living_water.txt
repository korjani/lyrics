I was down until I got tired and got up
I was broken until I got to the potter
I was alone no one could help me out
I was empty and dry
Until the rain fell down

So where do we go from here?
Lost in the middle of nowhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come to where you are
So I'm running

Cause I need living water
I'm coming back to the well where we first met
I need living water, pour yourself in me
Cause you are all I need
Living water

Moving fast, through life
Tryna be the best I can
Outside, while forgetting what I need to last
This time would you lead me and hold my hand?

So where do we go from here?
Caught in the middle of somewhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come here where you are
So I'm running

Cause I need, living water, I'm going back to the place
Where we first met
I need living water, pour yourself in me
Yeah

Cause I need, living water, I'm going back to the well
Where we first met
I need living water, pour yourself in me
You are all I need, living water

You're living water, living water.
