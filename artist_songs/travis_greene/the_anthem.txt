Sing Hallelujah
You have won the victory
Hallelujah
You have won it all for me

Death could not hold you down
You are the risen king
Seated in majesty
You are the risen king

Crucified with Christ
Dead now I'm alive
When they call me I will rise
You are the Promise Keeper
Resurrected, You rose in Victory
But in the grave You did redeem me
By Your love the world will see
I'm alive because of You

I'm alive
You're alive...
