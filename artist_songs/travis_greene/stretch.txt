I’m stretching out 
From where I am to where He’s taking me

On faith I clap, believing that strongholds are broken 
When I praise 
On faith I dance, receiving a new heart for You 
My hands are raised 
There is a reason why I spin 
There is a purpose why I shout 
Lord as I worship take me in 
And pour Your Spirit out 

I stretch my praise, reaching out for You 
My hands are raised, worshipping the Truth 
And Living God You are 
The Living God You are 
I stretch for You 

Reaching out for You
Reaching out for Heaven 
God You are the First, The Last, The Living God 

Reaching out for Truth
Reaching out in Worship 
God You are the First, The Last, The Living God 

You are Holy, Holy, Holy 
You are Righteous, Righteous, Righteous 
You are Perfect, Lord You’re Perfect 
You are Faithful, Faithful, Faithful 
You are Worthy, Worthy, Worthy 

I’m stretching out
From where I am, to where He’s taking me
