I have a picture, pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and we're laughing and loving it all
Look at our life now, tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears that we cry until dawn

Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start

You say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here and run far away
But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today

Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start

You ask if I love you, well what can I say?
You know that I do and if this is just one of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song, please don't cry anymore
And then I'll ask your forgiveness, though I don't know just what I'm asking it for

Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start

Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
