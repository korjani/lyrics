Let it rain
Let it rain

From the first day I met ya
I notice your style
Had that B-Boy swagger not one of the crowd
And you talked like you knew me
Kept coming around and I fell for ya, yeah
Then as time kept going I noticed some things
Said our love kept growing
Wanted to run away cause the situation's in the past
Love never really last
Memories just had a hold of me

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain)
Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Show me things I could never see (let it rain)
Cause we can fight and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'm staying with you only (let it rain)
Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

I use to wonder where were going
And where I wanted to be
Sitting alone all shocked up waiting for my destiny
Hearing songs on the radio wishing that could happen to me, oh no
Then when you came into the picture then I knew quickly
That we could build something so strong
Expect the best for the future
Forget about what used to be
I need you here all life long

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain)
Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Show me things I could never see (let it rain)
Cause we can fight and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'm staying with you only (let it rain)
Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

Cause I see the sunlight whenever we touch
All day and all night is never too much (All that were how)
Afraid of my feelings and falling too deep
But everybody's had this happen one time or another
When you need someone to set your heart free

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain down down on me)
Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Show me things I could never see (let it rain)
Cause we could fight and we make up
I wanna see you when I wake up
I'm staying with you only (let it rain)
Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (down on me baby)
Cause you help me open up my eyes
Show me things I could never see (let it rain)
Cause we can fight and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'm staying with you only (let it rain)
Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)
