Mirror, mirror on the wall
You seem to think you know it all
Why do, why do I believe?
You tear me down just to laugh
But if I break your shining glass
I'll just see pieces of me

No, no, no, don't you dare
Who do you think you are standing there?
I'll tell you

I am, I am, I am, I am worthy of love
Am I, am I, am I, am I strong enough?
Because it feels like I'm not anything at all
But I am, I am, I am, I am beautiful

Beautiful

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, that's what you do
It's time to change up the game
Can't be that little girl no more
The one you cut up on the floor
I'm done with all the shame

No, no, no, don't you dare
Who do you think you are standing there?
I'll tell you

I am, I am, I am, I am worthy of love
Am I, am I, am I, am I strong enough?
'Cause it feels like I'm not anything at all
But I am, I am, I am, I am beautiful

There was a time when I let you in
With all the doubt underneath my skin
I think it's time that I see the way

I am, I am, I am, I am worthy of love
Am I, am I, am I, am I strong enough?
'Cause it feels like I'm not anything at all
I am, I am, I am, I am beautiful
