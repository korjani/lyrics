When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah that's how you know it
Yeah that's how you know it's real

It's like we speak a different language
These double-sided conversations set me up
Keep dodging bullets in the bedroom
But neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're bending
Until we break down, say it now, we're through
All you do

When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah that's how you know it
Yeah that's how you know
When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah that's how you know it
Yeah that's how you know it's real

Those signs went through me like a freight train
You're getting off testing my patience 'til it's gone
But then again, I do the same thing
And neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're bending
Until we break down, say it now, we're through
All you do (oh all you do)

When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah that's how you know it
Yeah that's how you know
When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real (know it's real)
When love hurts, yeah that's how you know it
Yeah that's how you know it's real

(Yeah that's how you know it's real)

(Yeah that's how you know it's real)

And that's how you know it's real
Oh and I know it's real
