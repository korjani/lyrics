Hmm Yeaa (Ooh Ooh)
City Lights
It's on tonight Yea Yea (ooh ooh ooh ohh yea)
Out on the street, I'm looking for a celebration
Come roll with me, together we can crash the party and
Get on the floor, DJ please play my song
And we can do this all night long
Once again, it is on

I'm on a high
I feel like I'm on medication
I'm open wide, and we don't need no complications
Cause I feel alright
And all I see is red lights, and blue lights, and street lights
And it's real life, is that a sign

I'm under the city lights
It's on, its on tonight
My mood is right, its on its on tonight
Me and my girls (me and my girls)
Tonight it's our world (tonight it's our world)
I'm out tonight
Yea, I'm out tonight (Heyy)
Come on now

It's after dark
And I love stories in the morning
I can see the stars
Expensive cars on the boulevard
And now I'm so inspired
Cause I want to buy me a Lexus
Or maybe Ill get me a Beemer or Hummer,
It's summer
Its never too late
There's always more fascination
Just turn the page
And I won't be hesitating
Cause I can hardly wait
Do my dance, sway my hands
Hear my jam
You can count me in
I wish tonight will never end

I'm under the city lights
It's on, its on tonight
My mood is right, its on its on tonight
Me and my girls (me and my girls)
Tonight it's our world (tonight it's our world)
I'm out tonight
Yea, I'm out tonight (Heyy)
Come on now

I'm under the city lights
It's on, its on tonight
My mood is right, its on its on tonight
Me and my girls (me and my girls)
Tonight its our world (tonight its our world)
I'm out tonight
Yea, I'm out tonight (Heyy)
Come on now

[Repeat 4X]
I'm out tonight and it's all alright
See I'm out tonight, and it's alright

[Repeat Chorus 2X]
