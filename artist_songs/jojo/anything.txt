There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do)

Yo I don't know

Caught up in ya spell, it's voodoo boy
Well baby baby baby babe

I don't wanna play no more
Cause the only one that I want is you
So tell me what you wanna do because baby

Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby you can have your way
Just as long as I can have you

And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya

Now I've been told
That you got you a few and you ain't sure
But baby baby baby baby

On you, I don't check for dues no more
Cause baby baby baby baby

Cause every time that we rendezvous

And every time that I'm holding you
