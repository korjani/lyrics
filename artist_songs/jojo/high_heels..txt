Now you don't know, what you don't have
Until it's gone
Look through your phone
Like I should have all along

You've been a bad motherfucker
These pictures of these bitches I don't know
I'm going out and never ever coming home

I put my high heels on
Walk right out the door
Best believe, I'mma leave
Don't need you no more
Put my black dress on
Boy, you've done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets
And then move along

I'mma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on

Now you don't know, what you don't have
Until it's walking in some red stilettos
Talking to some handsome devils
Jealous well you should be
It's a feeling that I known way too well
A chance at having shot to hell

You've been a bad motherfucker
These pictures of these bitches I don't know
Without me boy you'll always feel alone

I put my high heels on
Walk right out the door
Best believe, I'mma leave
Don't need you no more
Put my black dress on
Boy, you've done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets
And then move along

I'mma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on
Walk right out the door
Best believe, I'mma leave
Don't need you no more

Now you don't know, what you don't have
Now you don't know, what you don't have
Until it's gone

I put my high heels on
Walk right out the door
Best believe, I'mma leave
Don't need you no more
Put my black dress on
Boy, you've done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets
And then move along

I'mma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on
