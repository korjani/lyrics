Got you drunk for your first time, definitely not mine
You missed church on Sunday
We were still fucked up from the Saturday night
Few tequila shots later in my hotel room naked
You said we should've waited
But I turned off all of the lights and took you to the dark side

I was young and I was up to no good, up to no good
I loved you in the only way that I could, way that I could

I was reckless with your heart
I took for granted the gift that you handed
Reckless with your heart
Wish I could change it
Sorry I made it
All about me, me, me, me, me
You were thinking about me, me, me, me, me
I was thinking about me, me, me, me, me
You were defenseless
And I was reckless with your heart

Did she have to repair you
To get you back to where you started from
Sometimes I wish I could meet her
Apologize, delete all the damage I've done

I was young and I was up to not good, up to not good
Someone left me in the way that I left you
It's how I understood

I was reckless with your heart
I took for granted the gift that you handed
Reckless with your heart
Wish I could change it
Sorry I made it
All about me, me, me, me, me
You were thinking about me, me, me, me, me
I was thinking about me, me, me, me, me
You were defenseless
And I was reckless with your heart

I realized that our love
Was your first time feeling the first time feeling
It happens to all of us
But you deserved a better start

I was reckless with your heart
I took for granted the gift that you handed
Reckless with your heart
Wish I could change it
Sorry I made it
All about me, me, me, me, me
You were thinking about me, me, me, me, me
I was thinking about me, me, me, me, me
You were defenseless
And I was reckless with your heart
