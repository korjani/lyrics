[VERSE 1:]
I don't know what it is that you've done to me 
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way 
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing 
It's a feeling that I want to stay 
'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time 
With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind 
I can't figure out just what to do 
When the cause and cure is you, you 

[CHORUS:]
I get so weak in the knees 
I can hardly speak, I lose all control 
Then somethin' takes over me 
In a daze, your love's so amazing 
It's not a phase 
I want you to stay with me, by my side 
I swallow my pride 
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak 

[VERSE 2:]
Time after time after time I've tried to fight it 
But your love is strong, it keeps on holdin' on 
Resistance is down when you're around, pride's fading 
In my condition I don't want to be alone 
'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time 
With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind 
I can't figure out just what to do 
When the cause and cure is you, you 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
I've tried hard to fight it 
No way can I deny it 
Your love's so sweet 
It knocks me off my feet 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE 2:]
I get so weak 
Blood starts racing through my veins 
I get so weak 
Boy it's somethin' I can't explain 
I get so weak 
Somethin' 'bout the way you do the things you're do-oo-oo-in' 
Knocks me right off of my feet (off my feet)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak (I get so)

[CHORUS TO FADE]
