[Verse 1:]
Nothin makes me more happy than to know 
That I have such a close friend 
To know that you're down for me is reassuring 
It's the reason I'm always smilin 

And when I'm kickin' it with you
I have a lot fun with you 
Never any kind of pressure 
Comin' from you 
Trying to get me to do 
Anything I'm not ready to 
That's why I really like you 

[Chorus:]
Da da da da da 
Da da da da da 
Da da da da da 
You make me happy 
Da da da da da
Da da da da da 
Da da da da da 
So very happy 

[Verse 2:]
I never get tired of talkin' on the phone with you 
For hours at a time 
And as time goes by we become grown up and wise 
I hope we'll be just as tight 

And it was supposed to be 
Then we're gonna be 
No one can stop what's destined
For you and me 
Who's to say that we 
Won't fall deep in love 
It's a very good chance because 

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
I might be young 
But I still know what it is (to be happy) 
I know what's in my heart 
I know what's on my mind 
And it's you all of the time 

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
