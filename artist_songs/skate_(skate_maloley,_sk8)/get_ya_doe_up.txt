Lately I been on my own shit
I ain't worried bout the chick
Mo money in the bank
But if she wanna fuck with the kid
She can come to the crib
Smoke weed everyday
Little bit a blow and a little bit a weed
Keep us up all night don't trip
Only L that we take is the one we wake and bake
You won't ever see the team forfeit
All the kids do drugs cause they wanna fit in
Hit the gas station
Go and get a soda
KDL got the drank man
What the fuck you think?
Double up
We can go and get to pour up
Slow up
Whole team bout to go up
20 years old
I remember pop told us

Don't chase no cat
Cause it always come back
When you go and get ya doe up [x3]
Don't chase no cat
Cause it always come back
When ya go and get ya doe up [x3]
Yeah, the women like that
When you put it on ya tab
Yeah, go and get ya doe up

[Chevy Woods:]
Pull up in the foreign
And ya know a nigga scoring
Skurt skurt
Doing donuts
Quarter million on that car
I'ma push a button
She gonna watch the doors go up
And that's on the game
We ain't in the same game
We ain't balling the same
You on the bench
And I'm all on the court
And that's all in the game
Dropping them numbers off
Putting them numbers up
Get me a check
Then I go run it up
No you not one of us
Don't you try running up
You tell me that was yo
Bitch...
She wanna fuck with us

Getting my money up
It's all to save it up
I like my cash in advance
When I'm with women
I feeling they energy
They like the fame and the bans
All I can do is just concentrate
On the success that I need
I'm rolling a sweet
That's T.G.L.D
The gang and freshlee

When you go and get ya doe up [x2]
Don't chase no cat
Cause it always come back
When ya go and get ya doe up [x2]
Don't chase no cat
Cause it always come back
When ya go and get ya doe up [x2]
