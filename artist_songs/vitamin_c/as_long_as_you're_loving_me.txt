Ohhh
Ooohhhh

I believe in you
This is real for me
What I feel for you
Didn't Come so naturally
At first I was afraid
Couldn't fight the fight
Couldn't keep the light on
With any other lights, oh love, oh love

Now I'm ready for the world no matter what it brings
I can feel all my dreams coming true
As long as you're loving me
As long as you're loving me

I can move mountains, I can part seas
My heart will be open for eternity
As long as you're loving me
Yeah, yeah

This is what feels good
This is what feels right
The moment I wake up
Until we say goodnight
And I'm stronger than I was
I've reached down and I've touched
It's easier to lie down with you on my side
On the side

Now I'm ready for the world no matter how it spins
Cause I'll always be in it with you
As long as you're loving me
As long as you're loving me (as long as you're loving me)

I can move mountains, I can part seas
My heart will be open for eternity
As long as you're loving me
Ohh, as long as you're loving me

Now I'm ready for the world no matter what it brings
I can feel all my dreams coming true
As long as you're loving me
As long as you're loving me

I know where I'm going
Where I belong
I'll be forever saving your loves
As long as you're loving me, ohhh
As long as you're loving me, mmmm
As long as you're loving me, yeaah
As long as you're loving me
