Ah, ah, ah

Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)
Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)

You were my best friend (best friend)
We've been through much together
And you have seen me (seen me)
In both good and bad weather
Someone had asked me
I'da said "Never!"

You kissed me and I kissed back
Boy and a girl, it's a natural fact

Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)
Sex has come between us
(come between us, tween, t-t-t-tween us)
Everything has changed
It's getting dull and strange
Sex has come between us

Okay
It was Sunday night (it was Sunday night)
You came over for coffee
And we stayed up all night (and we stayed up all night)
Getting closer just talking
Someone had asked me
And I'da said "No way!"

You touched me and I touched back
Girl and a boy in a natural act

Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)
Sex has come between us
(come between us, tween, t-t-t-tween us)
Everything has changed
It's getting dull and strange
Sex has come between us

You turn, turn me on
I never thought, thought you would
Is this a big, big mistake?
Or is this something good?

Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)
Sex has come between us
(come between us, tween, t-t-t-tween us)
Everything has changed
It's getting dull and strange
Sex has come between us

Everything has changed
It's pitiful and strange
How we rearrange
Sex..has come between us

Sex has come between us
(come between us, come between us)
Sex has come between us
(come between us, tween, t-t-t-tween us)
Everything has changed
It's getting dull and strange
Sex has come between us

You were my best friend
