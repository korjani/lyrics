Where's the party (party, party)
Where's the party (party, party)
Show me the way, show me the way

It's like a holiday
That happens everyday
I get to celebrate
No matter what you say
When I get real bored
I want something more
I never lose my head
Cause I know the score

Show me the way
Show me the way
C'mon, show me the way

Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Party all night 'til I can't go on
Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Show me the way, show me the way

One thing I know
Is when I feel low
I never have to worry
Got a place to party
no one's getting mean
It's so obscene
No matter what goes down
I just get what I need

Show me the way
Show me the way
C'mon, show me the way

Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Party all night 'til I can't go on
Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Show me the way, show me the way

Where's the party, where's the party
party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party
p-p-p-party

Show me the way
Show me the way
C'mon, show me the way

Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Party all night 'til I can't go on
Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Show me the way, show me the way

Show me the way, if you show me the way
C'mon show me the way

Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Party all night 'til I can't go on
Where's the party?
All I Wanna do is have some fun
Where's the party?
Show me the way, show me the way

Where's the party, where's the party
Where's the party, where's the party

Show me the way
Show me the way
