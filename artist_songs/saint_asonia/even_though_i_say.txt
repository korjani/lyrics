Oh, how I try to pick up what I leave behind
The trail of lies, it follows me all the time
I've known all along the difference of right or wrong
The damage has been done and I can't just rewind
But I can try and try and try 'cause it makes me feel alive

And even though I say
I'm sorry I'm this way
And even though I've changed
People will stay the same
And even though I don't play
I've become fair game
And if you're looking at me
Like I'm the cause of your living hell
Well take a look at yourself

Oh, how you cry when I leave for the other side
Something makes me wanna go away but I can't decide
You knew all along the difference of right and wrong
This movie feels like it's too long but you can't just rewind
But you can try and try and try if it makes you feel alive

And even though I say
I'm sorry I'm this way
And even though I've changed
People will stay the same
And even though I don't play
I've become fair game
And now you're looking at me
Like I'm the cause of your living hell
Just take a look at yourself

You make me feel like I'm so small
I keep sinking in this hole
I'm getting closer to the edge
One more step and watch me fall
You said so much I believed it all

You can lie and lie and lie
If it makes you feel alive

And even though I say
I'm sorry I'm this way
And even though I've changed
People will stay the same
And even though I don't play
I've become fair game
And if you're looking at me
Like I'm the cause of your living hell
Well take a look at
Just take a look at you
Well take a look at yourself
