Well can you hear that sound of my insides turning out
The meaning of my life will never be found
I'm playing life's little games
Seeing faces without names
And all around me people change while I just stay the same
So for your own good

Write me off
Let me go
It's obvious to me
I'll never be the one you need
So leave me now
Don't turn around
I'm just a living casualty
I'm your happy tragedy
Your happy tragedy

Will you bring me in
Watch the scaling of your skin
The meaning of my thoughts are so far within
You want to play my game
Watch the crazy
Watch me sane
And all the while you're rearranging, I just stay the same
So for your own good

Write me off
Let me go
It's obvious to me
I'll never be the one you need
So leave me now
Don't turn around
I'm just a living casualty
I'm your happy tragedy

I've never been enough for you
Everything I said I'd do
I've never been enough for you
It's never been enough

Write me off
Let me go
It's obvious to me
I'll never be the one you need
So leave me now
Don't turn around
I'm just a living casualty
I'm your happy tragedy

Can you hear the sound of my insides turning out
There's no meaning I'm just your happy tragedy
I'm playing life's little games
Seeing faces without names
I'm your happy tragedy
I'm your happy tragedy
