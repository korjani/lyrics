I took a plane 
I took a train 
(Ah, who cares, you always end up in the city) 

I said to Carl 
Look up for once 
(See just how the sun sets in the sky) 

I said to Jon 
Do you think the girls here 
(Ever wonder how they got so pretty?) 
Oh well I do 

Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 

All the boys 
With their home-made microphones 
(Have very interesting sounds) 

All the girls falling to ruin 
Dropping out of school, breakin' daddy's heart 
(Just to hang around) 

I walked into the local record store 
And asked for an American music anthology 
It sounds fun 
They taught my sketches (?)
Stuck 'em on the walls of PS1 

I took a plane 
I took a train 
(Ah, who cares, you always end up in the city) 

Stranded at Bleeker and Broadway 
Looking for something to do 

Someone somewhere asked me is there anything in particular I can help you with? 
(All I ever want to help with was you) 

Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour 
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour
