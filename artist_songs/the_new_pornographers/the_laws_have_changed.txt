It was crime at the time
But the laws, we changed 'em
Though the hero for hire's
Forever the same one

Introducing for the first time
Pharaoh on the microphone
Sing all hail
What'll be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne?

Awakened to cheers after years on the faultline
We are shocked to be here
In the face of the meantime
Pharaoh, all your methods have taught me
Is to separate my blood from bone

It will all fail
Feeling what i feel today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne

Form a line through here
Form a line to the throne

Alone in the chain
It remains to be seen how
How well you can play
When the pawn takes a queen now

It was crime at the time
But the laws have changed
Yeah
