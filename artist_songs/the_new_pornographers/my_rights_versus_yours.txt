Under your wheels, the hope of spring 
Mirage of loss, a few more things 
You left your sorrow dangling 
It hangs in air like a school cheer 

Complex notes inside the chords 
On every wall inflections carved 
Deep as lakes and dark as stars 
Remember we were the volunteers 

(Ooooh) Courts knew this and nothing more 
(Ooooh) Now it's my rights versus yours 

Under your wheels, your hopeless reign 
You fall too hard-we're up too late 
We hang suspended from the heights 
Until it's safer to walk here 

Under your wheels, your chance is with 
The easy call, the called-off search 
The medicine, it still won't work 
But there's dangerous levels of it here 

(Ooooh) Same thing as the other time 
(Ooooh) But now it's your rights versus mine 

The truth in one free afternoon 
The truth in one free afternoon 

Under my wheels the chance is held 
Gave me to save me from myself 
Spectacles painted with my shaking hand 

Fingers in paints, in paints we brought 
Thinking we'd leave them when we're not 
Flying the flags of new empires in rags 

The new empire in rags 
The truth in one free afternoon 
A new empire in rags 
The truth in one free afternoon 
A new empire in rags 
The truth in one free afternoon 
A new empire in rags 
The truth in one free afternoon 

Under your wheels, the fits and starts 
The time to dabble in the arts 
To tease the packs of dogs in charge 
But kid it's all wasted on me 

Under your wheels, the hope of spring 
Mirage of loss, a few more things 
The medicine it still won't sing 
But there's dangerous levels of it here 

(Your rights over my rights now 
We came to the right place 
Your rights over my rights now 
Your rights over my rights now 
We came to the right place 
Your rights over my rights now 
Your rights over my rights now)
