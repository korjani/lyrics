In home theaters
Still projecting
Undestructing
A voice from the back of your
Double feature
Soft and harder
Wait
In silence
While planning your attack

Shining through the hollow today
Thinking maybe heavens away
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens

In torn seats are
Film leaders
Lead the charging
Of armies into war, yeah
Lead the charge of
Twin teachers
False and feature
Picture and author, yeah
Flipping through the photos they send ya
Going to 16th and Valencia

They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens

Team
Teeming with things
You can find in the dark
Dust in the light
Falling through
Day after night
Falling with you
Photos of you
Oooooooooohhhh

In soft seats are
Stills projecting
No protecting
From voices in the back of ya
Double feature
Soft and heartland
Stone the hope then
They slip ya through the cracks yeah
Flipping through the photos they send ya
Going to 16 and Valencia
