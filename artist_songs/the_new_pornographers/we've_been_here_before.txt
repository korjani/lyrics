Here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before

We couldn't find a way out
When we were here, the first time
Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

Didn't choose what we mean
Just go along with what's played
There were rules once back when
There should be rules again

Here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before
And we couldn't find a way out
When we were here, the first time
Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

And oh, to leave them behind
And gold to trade for my life
Where we end up again
The gods of bad parties reign
Shoots by invasion lights
Round the same block again

So here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before
And we couldn't find a way out
When we were here the first time

Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

We've been here before...
