Jackie, you yourself said it best when you said
There's been a break in the continuum
The United States used to be lots of fun
Back when the man and the myth
Of the sands and the cliffs
Composed a symphony to good works and better business

Jackie, you yourself said it best when you said
One day we'll look upon a washed up atlantic
Get our kicks on an ocean of antics
And making history has never been so easy

So visualize success but don't believe your eyes
There's a world of wisdom and pain to despise
And when people get paid just to set you straight it means...

...are you gonna start the sunshine?
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)
and you're gonna start the sunshine
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)

Visualize success
Visualize success
Visualize success but don't believe your eyes
What is a version of the world without the will to despise it?
And when people get paid just to set you straight it means...

Jackie
(Hey, hey)
Jackie
(Hey, hey)
