You can imagine all the factions
That form around high ticket attractions
High on the spirit, hopped up and mystic
After the flame baptism you're fearless

You know the science of falling
You have your calling
You know the song

The Magna Carta, it's underwater
We left it there for the sons and the daughters
One day they'll find it; they'll be reminded
When we live undersea like we ought to

Didn't know flying from falling
Clueless the poor thing
Sad to report
Didn't know losing from learning
Wheels were turning
You know the song

This thing could go two ways
Won't be another exit for days
So pack a small suitcase
Anything else can be easily replaced

You feel the suction, the call to action
That will surround high ticket attractions
You want to travel, want to unravel
Take the experience to the next level

With no respect for the warning
The violence of yearning
Defiance of learning
In protected encryption
The voice of addiction
You know the song

This thing could go two ways
Won't be another exit for days
So pack a small suitcase
Anything else can be easily replaced

You know the song
You know the song
You know the song
You know the song

You can imagine all the factions
That form around high ticket attractions
Just like the Mayans took all their science
And dumped it all in the drink and went silent

They knew the science of falling
They had their calling
You know the song

This thing could go two ways
Won't be another exit for days
So pack a small suitcase
Anything else can be easily replaced

This thing could go two ways
Won't be another exit for days
So pack a small suitcase
Anything else can be easily replaced
