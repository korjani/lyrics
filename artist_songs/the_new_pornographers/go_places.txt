Yes a heart will always go one step too far 
Come the morning and the four corners I see 
What the moral of the back story could be 
Come with me, go places 

And a heart will always stay one day too long 
Always hoping for the hot flashes to come 
For the glue to dry on our new creation 
Come with me, go places 

Come head on, full circle 
Our arms fill with miracles 
Play hearts, kid, they work well 
Like classics play aces 
Stay with me, go places 
Once more for the ages 

Yes a heart should always go one step too far 
Come the morning and the day winding like dreams 
Come the morning every blue shade of green 
Come with me, go places 

Come head-on, full circle 
Our arms fill with miracles 
Play hearts, kid, they work well 
Like magic, play aces 
Stay with me, go places 
Once more for the ages 

Come one now, come all ye 
This story breaks free here 
Tales from the back pages 
From somewhere, Encida 
Deus ex machina 
Good morning, Christina 

Come head on, full circle 
Our path blocked but sure we'll 
Make records, then set them 
Make copies, win races 
Stay with me, go places 
Once more for the ages
