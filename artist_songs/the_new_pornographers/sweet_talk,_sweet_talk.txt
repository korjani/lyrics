A mistake on the part of nature
You're so fair and so fey that you'll sit anywhere
I've pencil sketched the scene
It's feeling Byzantine

Mistakes on the part of nature
The living proof of what they're calling love
On certain sideway streets
Where things that don't match meet

A mistake on the part of nature
You are a tall glass, a blast from the past
Yeah, things were simpler then
You ask exactly when

A mistake on the part of nature
It's forgive and move on
Won't wear my Sunday suit to walk that street
That would feel Byzantine

Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talk

Amnesia becomes ambition
Ambition becomes a new sort of 
Charming simplicity
Like always Byzantine

A mistake on the part of nature
It's forgive and move on
Won't wear my Sunday suit to walk that street
That would feel Byzantine

Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talk

Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talk
