Yes I know it was late 
We were greeting the sun 
Before long 
And you live with someone 
I live with somebody too 
Leave it there 
For safe keeping 
One of the west village in plains 
That was the custom 
Come dawn 

On the walls of the day 
In the shade of the sun 
We wrote down 
Another vision of us 
We were the challengers of 
The unknown 
"Be safe" you say 
Whatever the mess you are you mind okay 
That is the custom 
On down 

Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na 
Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na... 

Until I see you around 
Until we clear the accounts 
Leave it there 
Leave it to us 
We are the challengers of 
The unknown 

Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-la 
Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-la
