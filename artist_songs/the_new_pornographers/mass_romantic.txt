Mass romantic fool wears Foster Grants
His books on tape ring true
Like everyone wants to say "I love you" To someone on the radio, radio

The first voice in the hollowed stars
Now the one true loves, and author of
"My Life Among the Kids Who Go to Shows."
This is not the way.

In the streetlight dawn
In the streetlight dawn
This street turns on

Mass romantic fool, separated by sheets
When the curtain calls you speaking
On the themes of stolen virtue
missing from the radio, radio

Now this romantic duel is into the streets
Bon appetit, you've eaten me alive you realize

This is not the way
In the streetlight dawn
This beat turns on
This boy's life among the electrical lights
