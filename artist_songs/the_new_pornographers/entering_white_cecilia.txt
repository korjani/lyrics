Cruising the magnetic strip 
I seized the ship 
I wanted it to be me that was with you 
Site unseen shot through with meaning 
I ran to the door, looked around 
I fell to the floor just to see if it was down there 

Your little chorus of angels 
Howling "What gives in? 
Hey, what is with you?" 
Just look around at how the other half lives 
So you did 
But you couldn't decide it 

Entering white Cecilia 
Entering white Cecilia 
What's eating you tonight? 
Who cares? 
There's a bunch of them 
So what if you saw one of them go? 

Cruising the magnetic strip 
I seized the ship 
I wanted it to be me that was with you 
Site unseen shot through with meaning 
You ran to the door 
I fell to the ground 
You had a view and the ballroom was down there 

Entering white Cecilia 
Entering white Cecilia 
What's eating you tonight? 
Who cares? 
There was a bunch of them 
So what if you had one of them go?
