Balancing on 
One wounded wing 
Circling the edge 
Of the neverending 
The best of the vanished marvels have gathered inside your door 

More than begin 
But less than forget 
But spirits born 
From the not happened yet 
Gathering there 
To pay off a debt brought back from the wars 

We thought we lost you 
We thought we lost you 
We thought we lost you 
Welcome back 

Sleeping for years 
Pick through what is left 
Through the pieces that fell and rose from the depth 
From the rainwater well 
Deep as a secret nobody knows 

Less than forget 
But more than begun 
These adventures in solitude never done 
To the names of our rooms (?) 
We send the same blood back from the wars 

We thought we lost you 
We thought we lost you 
We thought we lost you 
It will all come back 

I know you want to 
Run far away from one more 
And that it's comin' at a bad time 
Some cold place 
Heartless ways 
For all we know 

I know you need to 
Breathe through 
Come back 
Come too 
But it's comin' at a bad time 
Tangled day 
For all we know 

I know you want to 
Run far away from one more 
And that's comin' at a bad time 
Some cold race 
Heartless ways 
For all we know 

I know you want to 
Breathe through 
Come back 
Come too 
But it's comin' at a bad time 
Old scarred face 
Survivor's guilt 
For all we know
