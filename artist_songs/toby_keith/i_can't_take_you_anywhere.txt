You've been a part of my life for so very long
It's hard for me to believe sometimes that you're really gone
I tuck your memory away in that special hiding place
Hoping no one could tell by the look on my face
That you're still in my heart, always on my mind
Part of my everyday
Like just last night I went out for a bite
I tried to have fun with all of my might
But even the laughter, it wasn't much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my salad and steak
Bobby Joe walked in with a couple of friends
And said, "Hey have you heard from her at all man like
Where's she been?"

And it, struck a nerve
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere

So I left all alone, just headed back home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one from an old friend
He said, "I drove by your house tonight dude but
You weren't in
Just checkin' up on you boy, I hope you're doin' alright
Oh by the way man, I seen her last night

And it, struck a nerve
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere

I swear, I can't take you
Just can't take you
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
