Rollin' down the Interstate
Headin' out to Illinois
Runnin' 'bout 95
Listen to my engine, boy

Sand burnin' beano
Westcoast, turn around
I don't make no money, they love
Sittin' the friggin' trailer down

Peter Bills' pullin' out
Now I'm pulin' up behind and
Son, if you can't find 'em, ground 'em

Got the roadhouse rockin' on the radio
Takes a lot of rig to haul a big payload
Takes a lot of men to make the 18 road

Pop another white cross
Dodge another speed cop
Hit another truck stop
Drive it on home

Got the redneck romeo
Bagged all sittin' there
I'm wide open in a
Hammered down rockin' chair

Big bambino
Front door, green light
City ain't seen no
Bear traps all night

Need to stop and grab a bite
And I could use a tag along
Ladybug, where'd you go?
Great, you got your ears on

Got the roadhouse rockin' on the radio
Takes a lot of rig to haul a big payload
Takes a lot of men to make the 18 road

Pop another white cross
Dodge another speed cop
Hit another truck stop
Drive it on home

We got the roadhouse rockin' on the radio
Takes a lot of rig to haul a big payload
Takes a lot of men to make the 18 road

Pop another white cross
Dodge another speed cop
Hit another truck stop
Burn another black top

Makin' me some good time
Cross another county line
Pass the city limit sign
Drive it on home
Drive it on home, baby

I'm gonna push it, yeah
I'm gonna push it, baby
Ooh
