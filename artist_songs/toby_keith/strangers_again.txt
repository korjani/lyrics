You couldn't tell by lookin' we'd ever met before
I hardly ever see her, she don't come by any more
With all the time we spent together, I thought by now she would've called
It's amlost like she never even know my name at all

But the first night I met her, we were just strangers
Small talk conversation, we became friends
One morning we woke up and we'd turned into lovers
At the end of the line now, we're strangers again

This used to be our hangout, now I guess it's only mine
And all our friends still come here, they ask about her all the time
I say I spoke to her just yesterday, no wait, two days ago
I guess that girl will never change, but I'm the only one that knows

That the first night I met her, we were just strangers
Small talk conversation, we became friends
One morning we woke up and we'd turned into lovers
At the end of the line now, we're strangers again

But the first night I met her, we were just strangers
Small talk conversation, we became friends
One morning we woke up an we'd turned into lovers
At the end of the line now, we're strangers again

At the end of the line now, we're strangers again
