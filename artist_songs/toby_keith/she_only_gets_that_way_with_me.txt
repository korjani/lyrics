She ain't shy
She's outspoken boy
She always speaks her mind
Except those quiet little moments
When I am all she needs
And I hold her tenderly
She only gets that way with me

She don't cry
Some how she seems to keep it all inside
Until those magic little moments
When I am all she needs
And the love is good you see
She only gets that way to me

And she gets sad sometimes
She'll never show it
You might make her mad
But you'll never know it
She don't wear her heart out on her sleeve
She only gets that way with me

And she ain't weak
My baby's just as strong as she can be
Until those nights she comes and tells me
That the want to in my eyes
Gives her butterflies
She only gets that way with me
She only gets that way with me
She only gets that way with me
Thank God she only gets that way with me
