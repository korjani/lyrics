I don't want to cry
I don't want to walk the floor
This mobile home
Don't feel like home no more
Since you left tell me what else can I do
Just come back home
Forgive me and forget it
This bed I made
I'm tired of sleepin' in it
It's freezin' cold, and baby that ain't cool
I'm waitin' on you
Here at the ponderosa trailer park
There wasn't nothin' that could keep us apart
Then I broke your heart, in our

Double wide, double wide, double wide paradise
Come on back to our double wide paradise
Double wide, double wide paradise

I bought a swimmin' pool
From the man at sears
He put it together
I filled it up with tears
Can't find no happiness no matter what I do
Just 'cause I got
The treasures of the world
It don't mean nothin'
If I ain't got you girl
Inside my castle
I got the king size blues
I'm waitin' on you
So baby when you get to feelin' alone
You know I always leave my porch light on
So you can come back home, to our

Double wide, double wide, double wide paradise
Come on back to our double wide paradise
Double wide, double wide paradise

We can have a second honeymoon
We'll throw some ribs on the barbecue
Just like we used to do

Double wide, double wide, double wide paradise
Come on back to our double wide paradise
Double wide, double wide paradise
