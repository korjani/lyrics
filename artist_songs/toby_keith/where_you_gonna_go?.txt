June fell for Johnny on the Forth of July,
As the fireworks popped in the summer sky.
With a spark in her eye, she just there an' stared,
As his face lit up to the rocket's red glare.
An' by September, she'd asked him for a weddiing band.
How could she know he was a ramblin' man.
He walked out the door in the dead of the night.
An' a sleepy voice whispered, as he turned out the light:

"Where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"Oh, you're never gonna find,
"Someone who loves you like I do.
"If you get tired of runnin',
"You can turn around an' walk back to me."

He called up to tell her he missed her a lot.
Texas Panhandle was as far as he got.
He'd run out money, he'd run of luck:
He'd run out of gas in his pick-up truck.
"Hitch a ride, catch a train or a Greyhound bus,
"'Cause there's a baby on the way an' that makes three of us.
"An' I need you here beside me, I can't go it alone,"
She told him one more time then she hung up the 'phone,

Sayin': "Where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"You know, you're never gonna find,
"Someone who loves you like I do.
"When you get tired of runnin',
"You can turn around an' walk back to me."

An' the years just seemed to roll on by them.
She missed him more an' more every day.
An' that boy grew up to look and act just like him,
An' she knew some day soon he'd be old enough to fly away.

An' she'd say: "Baby, where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"You know, you're never gonna find,
"Someone who loves you like I do.
"When you get tired of runnin',
"You can turn around an' walk back to me."

"If you ever get tired of runnin',
"Turn around an' walk back to me."
