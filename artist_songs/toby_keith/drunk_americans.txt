We ain't east, we ain't west, we ain't left, we ain't right
We ain't black, we ain't white, we just came here to drink
We're all mud flaps and 'burbans, all ball caps and turbans,
All prom queens and strippers, we're the whole kitchen sink
And in here, were the same, everyone knows your name

We just raise up our glass, we don't give a rat's ass if you're a
Democrat or republican, We're happy to be here and that you can see we're just all drunk Americans.

We ain't second ex-wives, we ain't cowboys or redskins,
Ain't preachers or kingpins, we're just having fun
We're all suits and blue collars, short orders, long haulers
Paper and plastic, too old and too young, CEO's, GED's, DUI's, FBI's, BHD's

And we raise up our glass, we don't give a rat's ass if your belly's too fat or your wallet's too thin,
We're happy to be here and that you can see we're just all drunk Americans.

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la-a
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la-a
All drunk Americans

We've been in, we've been out, we've been cool, we've been weird
Thank God we're still here, in the land of the free
And we all sing it wrong but we all sing a-long
Sing along

We just raise up our glass, we don't give a rats ass if you're a
Democrat or republican, We're happy to be here and that you can see we're just all drunk Americans.
In these neon lights, we're all stars, we're all stripes,
And we're all drunk Americans.
