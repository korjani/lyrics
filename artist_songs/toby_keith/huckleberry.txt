Just off of the two-lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden A-frame with a yellow tin roof top
One day it was raining on this world
She said ‘have you ever really, really ever kissed a girl?’ 

Baby I’ll be your Huckleberry, you don’t have to double dare me 
If the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there 
You’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We’ll grow up and we’ll get married
I’m gonna be your Huckleberry 

Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared 
It was two bucks to experience the thrill
She said ‘come on boy let’s get in line I’ll ride it if you will’ 

Baby I’ll be your Huckleberry, you don’t have to double dare me 
If the ride gets wild and scary count on me to be right there 
You’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries 
We’ll grow up and we’ll get married 
I’m gonna be your Huckleberry 

Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior/senior prom 
Went lookin’ for some romance before I had to get her home
Steamin’ up the windows of my car
She said ‘until I get my wedding ring boy we can’t go that far’ 

Baby I’ll be your Huckleberry, you don’t have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there 
You’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We grew up and we got married 
Now look at those three little Huckleberries
