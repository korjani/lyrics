There's no need to apologize
This happens time and time again
As soon as somebody lays their eyes on her
They dial right in
I watched you sneak a look
From the other side of the floor
And as I danced her by i watched you steal one more

You don't have to tell me she's beautiful
You don't have to say things like one-of-a-kind
You don't have to wonder if she loves me man
I know that's crossed your mind
Seems like everywhere we go
There's always somebody staring at her
Yeah I know she hung the moon
I'm the one that held the ladder

Now if you had half a chance
You'd probably make a play
Ah but if you were to ask her to dance
She'd only turn you away
So you'll never ever know
But buddy if you were in my shoes
You'd see that she's just as pretty on the inside too

You don't have to tell me she's beautiful
You don't have to say things like one-of-a-kind
You don't have to wonder if she loves me man
I know that's crossed your mind
Seems like everywhere we go
There's always somebody staring at her
Yeah I know she hung the moon
I'm the one that held the ladder

Yeah I know she hung the moon
Cause I'm the one that held the ladder

There's no need to apologize
This happens time and time again
