I almost said I love you
Could I really be that kind of guy
See one candle burning in your eye
And watch my heart fill up with butterflies
I almost said I need you
Girl I shouldn't go there anymore
Act like I never been in love before
You probably think it's my first time
Is this what love's all about
Am I getting in too deep
Wouldn't want to freak you out
Make a promise I can't keep

So close your eyes and hum along
And I'll sing you one more love song
If everything is still alright
Why don't you just crash here tonight

Close your eyes and hum along
And I'll sing you one more love song
If everything is still alright
Why don't you just crash here tonight

Girl if everything is still alright
Why don't you just crash here tonight
