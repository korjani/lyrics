Seems like only yesterday
We put our Christmas things away
Now here's another Christmas day with you
When you're in love, how time does fly
And this year that's just flown by
Had been one happy holiday for two

Christmas to Christmas
Wrapped in your arms
Love's always in season
And always so warm
Till my days on earth are through
I will spend Christmas to Christmas lovin' you

Yes, the givin' season's here again
Time to love your fellow man
Yuletide smiles are in demand, it's true
The love we share is for all time
We'll feel its glow right through July
To melt the cold when winter flies anew

Christmas to Christmas
Wrapped in your arms
Love's always in season
And always so warm
Till my days on earth are through
I will spend Christmas to Christmas lovin' you

Till my days on earth are through
I will spend Christmas to Christmas lovin' you
