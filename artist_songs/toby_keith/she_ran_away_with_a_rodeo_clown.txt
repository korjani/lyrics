She's a top barrel racer
Cowboy chaser
She drinks tecate like it's goin' out of style
She's real good lookin' And pretty good at hookin'
Any man she wants with just a little smile

I drawed a strong one
A big full grown one
He punched me out when I hit the ground
I came to with a panoramic view
Lookin' for my baby
She was nowhere around

I looked up, I looked down
I ain't seen her since the second go-'round
Somebody said they seen her headin' out of town
Now she ran away with a rodeo clown
She ran away with a rodeo clown

She's got twenty-two dollars
And makeup on her collar
She left some clothes so she's travelin light
But I'll bet a new saddle
And forty head of cattle
That I could catch 'em both if I drove all night
But this don't make sense
She's done jumped the fence
And I'm speedin' cross Texas on a broken heart
I'm goin' home where the coyote roam
Makin' my camp at the end of the bar

I looked up, I looked down
I ain't seen her since the second go-'round
Somebody said they seen her headin' out of town
Now she ran away with a rodeo clown
She ran away with a rodeo clown

I looked up, I looked down
I ain't seen her since the second go-'round
Somebody said they seen her headin' out of town
Now she ran away with a rodeo clown
She ran away with a rodeo clown
