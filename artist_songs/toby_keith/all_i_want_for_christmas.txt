You could shop until you drop
At every mall in town
Searching for that special gift for me
Cowboy boots, a hunting suit
That would be just fine
But you can't buy the biggest wish of mine

Honey, all I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you
Twelve more months of loving
A heart so sweet and true
Make me a promise
That's the best that you can do
All I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you

I could make a list of my requests
And send them to Santa Claus
Tell him what a good man I've been
He could land up on our rooftop
Bring it all on Christmas eve
But you've still got the greatest gift for me

Honey, all I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you
Twelve more months of loving
A heart so sweet and true
Make me a promise
That's the best that you can do
All I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you

I could be so happy
Holding you by firelight
Listening to you whisper
I'm yours for life

Honey, all I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you
Twelve more months of loving
A heart so sweet and true
Make me a promise
That's the best that you can do
All I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you

Honey, all I want for Christmas
Is a new year with you
