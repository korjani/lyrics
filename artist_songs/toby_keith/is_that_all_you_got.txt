This old heart didn't die
It's been broke by the best
But I made it out alive
When you laid our love to rest

Baby, it burned, that corner got turned
And I'm doin' well these days
I've got some stones so, girl, bring it on
What do you expect me to say?

Is that all you got, is that all there is?
All you can hit me with?
Still standin' tall after the fall
Girl, is that all you've got to do?

Sit around
Tryin' to bring a cloud of rain my way
See I found out
I can just sleep in on a stormy day

That sun's gonna shine and given the time
It'll be clear again
Out of the hole, back in control
And I took it square on the chin

Is that all you got, is that all there is?
All you can hit me with?
Still standin' tall after the fall
Girl, is that all you've got to give?

Is that all you got, is that all there is?
All you can hit me with?
Still standin' tall after the fall
Girl, is that all you've got to give?

Is that all you got?
Is that all there is?
Is that all you got?
Is that all there is?
