On a cold night, late December
As the snow fell to earth
That's the one night, we remember
When a woman gave birth
And for miles and miles around
The baby's cry was the only sound

Did He know the world was filled with pain
Could He feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did He know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made the baby cry?
Is that what made the baby cry?

As his Mother turned to hold Him
Her face filled with joy
He grew quiet when She told Him
He was more than just her baby boy
And for miles and miles around
Her lullaby was the only sound

Did She know the world was filled with pain
Could She feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did She know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made Her baby cry?
Is that what made Her baby cry?

And as He fell asleep
She wiped away His tears
But the question still remains
Have we changed in two thousand years

Don't you know the world is still in pain
Can't you feel all the hunger and the shame
Did we forget about the way that He died
And the reason why
Would we still make the baby cry?
Would we still make the baby cry?
