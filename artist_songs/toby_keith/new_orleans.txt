He was twenty-five, she was twenty-eight
He was home grown country, she'd just pulled off the interstate
She bought a Dr. Pepper, ten dollars worth of gas
She was ovbiously lost but too afraid to ask directions
So he offered her a smile and a stick of Beech Nut gum
He said where you headed to girl, where are you coming from
She said

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

First she stayed a day then she stayed a week
Couple of months later they were living on his parent's street
He worked the station and she worked the store
And then they had a baby and
Then they had one more little Jesse

When she dropped the kids off at the mother's day out
All the ladies had their questions
But they knew not to ask about

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

Wednesday night supper at the First Baptist Church
Stranger standin' in the doorway
As they're passin' out the dessert
He said go on and pack your bags
Cause I'm here to take you home
I'm goin' back to Louisiana
And woman I ain't gonna go with out you

There's a few defining moments in every person's life
When you know what you've done wrong
And you know what you've done right
And before the congregation and her husband and her kids
She says, "How dare you even speak to me
After everything you did"...in

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

That's another town, that's another life
