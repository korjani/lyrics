Do blondes really have more fun
Or they just easier to spot in the dark?
Girl, I'm just tryin' to cheer you up
I saw you sittin' over here all alone, with a broken heart
It's hurtin' you real bad, wish there was somethin' that I had
I'd hook you up, get you through it
You might need a man to hold you 'til it don't
I'm just the guy to do it

Is that your pretty boy standin' there at the end of the bar
He's got some nerve
Talkin' loud and drinkin' with a red head ridin' shotgun on his arm
He's such a jerk
I think he's a knucklehead, all those ugly things he said were out of line
Man, he blew it
He might need someone to put him in his place
I'm just the guy to do it

Baby, I can't mend your broken heart
I can't take away your pain
I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine when you're walkin' in the rain
If you need a hero for tonight, I can be the one, let me prove it
Yeah, you just say the magic words and we'll be gone
I'm just the guy to do it

Baby, I can't mend your broken heart
I can't take away your pain
I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine when you're walkin' in the rain
Oh but if you need a hero for tonight, I can be the one, let me prove it
Yeah, you just say the magic words and we'll be gone
I'm just the guy to do it
