I can't believe it's come to this
Two broken hearts, one goodbye kiss
Is this all that's left of me and you
You seem to take it all in stride
While I'm crumbling inside
Letting go is hard for me to do
But if all my love is easy to refuse
Then I guess you just don't have as much to lose

'Cause I'm losing everything that ever meant anything
How can all of our yesterdays mean nothing to you
If all my love's so easy to refuse
Then I guess you just don't have as much to lose

If all my love's so easy to refuse
Then I guess you just don't have as much to lose

I can't believe it's come to this
Two broken hearts, one goodbye kiss
