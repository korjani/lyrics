Seven Thirty-five
She's someone else’s wife.
I can get on with my life,
And that thrills me.

She married him today,
Her daddy gave the bride away.
I heard a tear roll down her face,
And that kills me.

Cause now I
Can see why,
She's finally cryin.

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was puttin her through her hell,
Hell I couldn't tell.

She could've given me a sign,
Could've opened up my eyes.
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me.

Yea maybe I might’ve changed,
It's hard for me to say.
But the story's still the same,
It's a sad one.

And I'll always believe,
If she ever did cry for me,
They were tears that you can't see,
You know the bad ones.

And now I
Can see why
She's finally cryin.

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was puttin her through her hell,
Hell I couldn't tell.

She could've given me a sign,
Could've opened up my eyes.
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me.

With out a doubt, 
I know now
How it outta be, 
Now she's gone
And it's wrong, 
And it bothers me.
Tomorrow I'll still be,
Askin myself.

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was puttin her through her hell,
Hell I couldn't tell.

She could've given me a sign,
Could've opened up my eyes.
How was I supposed to see?

How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me.

Hell I couldn't tell...
