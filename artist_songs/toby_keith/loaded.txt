Sun's gettin' heavy and the night is fallin'
Phone ringin' it's a good time callin'
Old truck slicked up shinin' like a rhinestone

Takin' off like a big red pocket
Flyin' high by the time the band comes on

I'm loaded, got a fist full of cash
I'm rollin' just filled her up with cash
I'm goin' where I wanna be,
I got my baby beside me
She's strollin' and I like it a lot
She's showin' everything she's got
We're blowin' these twenty dollar bills
I can't tell ya how good I feel
I'm loaded

My baby's got her shoes off out on the dance floor
Gonna dance 'til she can't dance anymore
They haven't played "Give Me Three Steps",
"Give Me Three Steps" yet

Bought ten rounds for my buddies at the back bar
Stuck my last five in the tip jar
Stretched my dollar 'bout as far as it can stretch

What's that?--Checks?--You'd cash a check?--Well, hell!

I'm loaded, bring another round
Rock 'n rollin' my baby's still getting down
I'm blowin' through my twenty dollar bills
I can't believe how good I feel
I'm loaded--got a fist full of cash
I'm rollin' just filled her up with gas
I'm goin' where I wanna be--I got my baby beside me

I'm loaded (loaded)
Loaded (loaded)
Loaded (loaded)
Got my baby beside me

I'm loaded (loaded)
Rollin' (rollin')
Strollin' (strollin')
I got my baby beside me

I'm loaded (loaded)
Loaded (loaded)
Loaded (loaded)
