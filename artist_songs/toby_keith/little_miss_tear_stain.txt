You say you hate me,
You don’t love me,
You don’t ever wanna hear from me again
You’ve had time to think about it,
After all look at how long it’s been

You have second thoughts,
I wouldn’t know it,
‘Cause I ain’t heard a word since you went away
I’m gonna find out,
Next time I see you
Think I’m gonna walk right up to you and say,

Sweet little miss tear stain,
Would you entertain,
The thought of maybe having it all?
Could we ever get back together,
Or is never still a good time to call?

Are you still hot, girl, as a firecracker?
‘Cause you were smokin’ when you pulled out
I know hell ain’t freezin’ over,
But it might be chillin’ out by now

Sweet little miss tear stain,
Would you even entertain,
The thought of maybe having it all?
Could we ever get back together,
Or is never still a good time to call?

Yeah, could we ever get back together?
Or is never still a good time to call?

I’ll call you up baby,
Oh yeah.
