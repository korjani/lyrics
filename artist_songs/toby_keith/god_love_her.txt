Just a girl born in Dixie 
Washed in the blood 
And raised on the banks 
Of the Mississippi mud 
She always had a thing 
About fallin' in love with a bad boy 

Yea, they could see it all comin' 
But her daddy never dreamed 
She'd grow up that fast 
You know what I mean 
The way a girl gets 
When she turns 17 
Kinda crazy 

She's a rebel child 
And a preacher's daughter 
She was baptized in dirty water 
Her mama cried the first time 
They caught her with me 
They knew they couldn't stop her 

She holds tight to me and the Bible 
On the back seat of my motercycle 
Left her daddy standin' there 
Preachin' to the choir 
You see...God love her 
Oh me and God love her 

She kissed her mama goodbye 
Said I'll be sure 'n phone ya 
She called from a truck stop 
In Tucson Arizona 
With amazing grace 
We made California line 
And then my gypsy life 
Started takin' it's toll 
And the fast lane got empty 
And out of control 
And just like an angel 
She saved my soul from the devil 

Yea she's a rebel child 
And a preacher's daughter 
She was baptized in dirty water 
Her mama cried the first time 
They caught her with me 
They knew they couldn't stop her 

She holds tight to me and the Bible 
On the back seat of my motercycle 
Left her daddy standin' there 
Preachin' to the choir 
You see....God love her 
Oh me and God love her 

Now she holds tight to me and the Bible 
On the back seat of my motercycle 
Left her daddy standin' there 
Preachin' to the choir 
You see...God love her 
Oh me and God love her 
God love her 
Me and God love her
