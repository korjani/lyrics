I was hangin' out in Mexico, I had a beachfront bungalow
I know I should have gone home, but I was doin' that Caribbean thing
I was listenin' to a Spanish guitar, drinkin' margaritas under the stars
With a pretty senorita when the telephone started to ring, guess who

Hello, honey I was just about to
Hello, baby I was gettin' ready
Hello, I know I should have called sooner, oh, no, no
Hello, if you give me just a minute
Hello, don't you hang up till I'm finished
Hello, you're the only one I've ever, you know
Hello

Well, there was silence at the end of the line
I thought I'd give her till a quarter of nine
I forgot to call her back and the party was a-rollin' at ten
See, I was workin' on tequila and lime
I guess I never even noticed the time
I was dancin' the Iguana when the phone started ringin' again
And you know who

Hello, honey I was just about to
Hello, baby I was gettin' ready
Hello, I know I should have called sooner, oh, no, no
Hello, if you give me just a minute
Hello, don't you hang up till I'm finished
Hello, you're the only one I've ever, you know
Hello

Hello, honey I was just about to
Hello, baby I was gettin' ready

Hello, if you give me just a minute
Hello, don't you hang up till I'm finished
Hello, you're the only one I've ever, you know
Hello

Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello
