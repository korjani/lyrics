I can see her lyin' back in a satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess

Sundown, you better take care
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs

She's been lookin' like a queen in the sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better, when I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better, when I'm feelin' no pain

Y'all can probably sing this thing, can't you?

I can picture every move that a man can make
Gettin' lost in a woman is your first mistake

Sundown, you better take care
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better, when I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs

Sundown, you better take care
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again
