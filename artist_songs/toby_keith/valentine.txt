I bought a card down at the drugstore
It said I'm thinkin' of you
I'm put some flowers on the table
But I know you won't be home

These are some of the little things
That I do 'cause I still love you
And today might be the hardest day
I've had since you been gone

Valentine, girl do you still think about me
I still wake up at night callin' out your name
And the roses are there
Paper hearts are everywhere
But the fourteenth of February
Will never been the same

Where did we go wrong Val
I thought we had it made
Was it just my wishful thinkin'
Is it supposed to be this way

Oh but I still feel the magic
That comes this time of year
When everybody's got a sweetheart
And I'm wishin' that you were here

Valentine, girl do you still think about me
I still wake up at night callin' out your name
And the roses are there
Paper hearts are everywhere
But the fourteenth of February
Will never been the same

Valentine, girl do you still think about me
I still wake up at night callin' out your name
And the roses are there
Paper hearts are everywhere
But the fourteenth of February
Will never been the same
