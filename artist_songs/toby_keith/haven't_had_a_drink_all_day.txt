Oh, yeah,

Leaving San Bernardino I was running behind
I had a load on my trailer and a lot on my mind
And I was rocking, rolling 'cross the USA
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day

Pulled into Arizona about a hundred and one
When a smokey bear shot me with his radar gun
He said, "You're drunk, son." Yeah, there ain't no way
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day

This gal pal I found didn't bother a soul
I gave a pretty girl a ride to a watering hole
And she thanked me and I pulled her off the interstate
She said, "I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day."

I blew through Amarillo like a wild west wind
Stopped in Oklahoma City just to see an old friend
"What's up cous'?" he said, "I'm OK." Yeah
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day

Let's drive

Got home to Little Rock about 3 AM
My baby met me at the door with a bottle in her hand
"Good to see my man, let's celebrate." Yeah
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day
Said, I got drunk this morning but I haven't been stoned all day yeah
