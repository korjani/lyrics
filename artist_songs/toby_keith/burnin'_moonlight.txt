The needle showed the gas was low
And three dollars in my pocket
Her beauty got the best of me
And she didn't try to stop it
On a dead end road nobody knows
A thing about but me
We parked that old ford pickup truck
Under that cypress tree
Turnin midnight
Burnin moonlight

Yeah I was off and runnin
My fingers through her hair
You could cut the passion
With a knife
In that southern midnight air
I kissed her sweet on that pickup seat
As my blue jeans hit the floor
Her body heat
And my cold bare feet
Pressed up against the door
Turnin midnight
Burnin moonlight

Oh I still feel the same about you
I can't spend the night without you
You still move me
Turnin midnight
Burnin moonlight

It happened fast
Just like that
It didn't take us long
Like smoke rings off my cigarette
Our innocence was gone
And I wanted to say something
But I buttoned up instead
She sat there and brushed her hair
And a smile was all she said
Turnin midnight
Burnin moonlight

Girl I still feel the same about you
I can't spend the night without you
You still move me
Turnin midnight
Burnin moonlight
