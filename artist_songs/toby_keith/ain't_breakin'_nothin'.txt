I told you when I met you, don't try to love me
But I love you for trying to anyway
You're cryin' and it don't surprise me
That you can't find it in your heart to stay

This ain't the first time to be my own worst enemy
Baby, don't you worry, you found me

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' I don't already know

You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
And you say that it won't kill me to watch you go
But you ain't breakin' nothin' that ain't already broke

I used up all the whiskey
Me and Jesus got by
But still you goodbye kiss me
No matter how hard I try

I'm down lower than I like to go
This ain't the first time that I've dug out a lovin' soul

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' I don't already know

You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
And you say that it won't kill me to watch you go
But you ain't breakin' nothin' that ain't already broke
Ain't already alone, ain't already dealin' with you bein' gone

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' I don't already know

You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
I say that it won't kill me to watch you go
Baby, you ain't breakin' nothin' that ain't already broke

Already broke
Already broke
Already broke
