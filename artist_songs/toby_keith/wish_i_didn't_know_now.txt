I never ask you where your goin',
I never ask you where you've been 
I've never called and checked your story,
When you stayed out with all your freinds 
I've never tried to catch you lyin',
I didn't want to know the truth 
I'd rather go on lovin' blind girl,
Than go on lovin' without you

I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then 
I wish I could start this whole thing over again 
I'm not sayin' it's you,
You could never be true 
I just don't wanna know how it ends 
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands 
I'd still look like a fool in front of your freinds 
Yeah, I wish somehow I didnt know now what I didn't know then 

I've always said what I don't know 
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you 
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin', 
It ain't an easy thing to do,
Well I guess I should be goin' 
I sure found out too much to stay,
Please don't say your sorry 
I might wait another day

I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then 
I wish I could start this whole thing over again 
I'm not sayin' it's you,
You could never be true 
I just don't wanna know how it ends 
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands 
I'd still look like a fool in front of your freinds 
Yeah, I wish somehow I didnt know now what I didn't know then 

You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand 
I'd still look like a fool in front of your freinds 
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then 
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then
