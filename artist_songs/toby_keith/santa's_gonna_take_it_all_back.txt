You can have that perfume that you wanted
And you can have those earrings, too
I'll even get that TV set
But there's a few things you gotta do
'Cause you've been lettin' our love come second
And sometimes even third
Now, I've had enough and if you want that stuff
Hey, Santa's done give me the word that

If you ain't a good girl by Christmas
He said he's gonna take it all back
If you ain't got it right come Christmas night
He's gonna put it back in the sack
You've got a lot of things on your list
And you better straighten up your act
'Cause if you ain't a good girl by Christmas
Hey, Santa's gonna take it all back

Got you a car back on your birthday
But that didn't get me nowhere
I did dinner and wine on valentine's
And you acted like you didn't care
Hey, it's time you loved your fellow man
That's what the season is all about
Now, I've heard it said that it ain't what you get
But baby, I'm plum give out

If you ain't a good girl by Christmas
He said he's gonna take it all back
If you ain't got it right come Christmas night
He's gonna put it back in the sack
You've got a lot of things on your list
And you better straighten up your act
'Cause if you ain't a good girl by Christmas
Hey, Santa's gonna take it all back

Now, you've got a lot of things on your list
But if you don't straighten up your act
If you ain't a good girl by Christmas
Yeah, Santa's gonna take it all back
If you ain't a good girl by Christmas
Yeah, Santa's gonna take it all back

Aw, he's gonna get it all too baby
Box it up, put it up on that big sleigh
He might throw that car up with it
Wave bye-bye, I told ya, and I told ya
Santa's the man, baby
