Girl your bags are packed
And you ain’t coming back is written on them 
Take these memories with you
They’re just sad, and they’re blue and I don’t want them 
Oh you’re not so sure that you’re in love anymore 
And I ain’t gonna beg you to stay 
Ain’t it just like you to leave
Ain’t it just like me to let you walk away 

I hold a tender place in my heart for you and you know it 
I’ve never said it out loud 
Guess I was too proud to ever show it 
We always thought some night that we might get it right 
But that ain’t going to happen today 
Ain’t it just like you to leave 
Ain’t it just like me to let you walk away 

Honey you must think my heart is a revolving door 
The way you come and go as you please 
I don’t know if I should give up or try 
Or get down on my knees
Ain’t it just like me to pray 
Ain’t it just like you to turn and walk away 

Here you are at my door 
You’re wanting in, you’re wanting more and it’s open 
You win me over with that grin 
So I let you on in, and I’m hopin’ 
That this time you might stay forever 
But baby that just ain’t your style 
Ain’t it just like you to smile 
Ain’t it just like me to let you stay awhile 

Oh you must think my heart is a revolving door 
The way you come and go as you please 
And I don’t know if I should give up or try
Or get down on my knees 
Ain’t it just like me to pray 
Ain’t it just like you to make me feel this way 

Ain’t it just like you to smile 
Ain’t it just like me to let you stay awhile 

Girl your bags are packed 
And you ain’t coming back is written on them
