Well boy meets girl and it's a good bet
Girl's gonna play a little hard to get
But they both got the same thing on their mind
Ain't that the way that the world goes round
Don't it get you up get you down
It gets you walking around with a flashlight trying to find
Love

Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Oooh gotta getcha some love

Then boy sees girl with another guy
What he wouldn't give just to catch her eye 'cause man
She is so hot
But you can't compete with a superstar
He's got a big old house and little red car
And what need is the one thing you ain't got money

Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Oooh gotta getcha some money
Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Oooh gotta getcha some yeah

Then god smiles down from up above
The money rolls in and they fall in love
From the outside looking in it's a dream come true
But as time goes by something turns up missing
There's not enough hugging and not enough kissing
Before to long they better do what they gotta do you know

Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Oooh gotta getcha some babies
Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Oooh gotta getcha some yeah

You know curtain climbers, and rugrats, and tricycle motors
It don't matter what you call 'em you gotta have a whole house full of 'em
Ain't nothing in the world like youngins getcha some
