Burning up the phone until there's nothing left to say
So I lay here and just listen to you breathe
Girl you know it's only been a week since our first date
Back when you were just a stranger to me
I've never let another in so soon
I've never been caught talking to the man in the moon

And yet this is farther than I've ever fell
You know me much too well 
Funny it don't feel like we just met
It didn't take much time
Forever's more than crossed my mind
And we haven't even said "I love you" yet

Where did I surrender, can you tell me how and when
I'm the one who's always in control
Leading with my heart like there is nothing to defend
As I lay it all out on the line body and soul
I've never let another in so soon
I've never been caught talking to the man in the moon

And yet this is farther than I've ever fell
You know me much too well 
Funny it don't feel like we just met
It didn't take much time
Forever's more than crossed my mind
And we haven't even said "I love you" yet

And yet this is farther than I've ever fell
You know me much too well 
Funny it don't feel like we just met
It didn't take much time
Forever's more than crossed my mind
And we haven't even said "I love you" yet

No we haven't even said "I love you" yet
