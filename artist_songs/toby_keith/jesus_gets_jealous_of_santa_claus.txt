Layin' back in my easy chair
Late last Christmas eve
Silent night, twinkling lights
Presents 'round the tree
I heard my little girl's two bare feet
Comin' down the stairs
She was sad as I looked over
Draggin' her teddy bear

She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year

So, with her head on my shoulder
And her tears mixed with mine
I thought how little baby Jesus
Gets left out at Christmas time
It ain't about the money
Oh, money can't buy love
And I saw the light that Christmas night
With help from up above

She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year

She said that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year.
