Got me on a short leash, tied to your screen door
I used to run with the big dogs 'til I stretched out on your front porch
Used to be a hound dog, chased a lot of fast cars
Now I don't even bark when the kitty cats stroll through the back yard

I used to howl at the moon, yeah I've been known to roam
Then I caught her trail one day, followed this girl home
I ain't the same, she knows how to put my chain

They say that an old dog, can't learn a new trick
Well she taught me to stay the first day and I learned real quick
There's a doghouse, a fence and a gate latch
I keep my tail waggin' and I don't mind beggin for a good scratch

I used to howl at the moon, yeah I've been known to roam
Then I met this girl one day that brought this old stray home
I ain't the same, she knows how to pull my chain
