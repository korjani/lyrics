Just another sundown, Just another bar stool,
Just another place where a fool can find another fool,
Just another slow dance with just another she ain't you
Just another chance of feeling better than I really do

There was a time you told me you'd love me forever
But baby didn't forever get here fast

Just another midnight, Just another cigarette
Waitin' on the "it's gonna be alright" that hasn't got here yet

Yeah there was a time you told me you'd love me forever
But baby didn't forever get here fast

Just another closing time, Just another shot before
Just another long ride home that don't feel like home anymore

Mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm
