My buddy said his girlfriend is as pretty as can be
He said help a brother out tonight and come double date with me
She's gotta a baby sister and they're headed into town
They're lookin' for a good time
They're fun to be around

I said what do she look like?
He scratched his head and stated
"She was a home comin' football queen before she graduated.
We'll wine and dine and do 'em fine
and really double date 'em
Then take 'em back to the motel six and
Try to seperate 'em.

They showed up in a pick up
They were right on time
His was kinda heafty
But not half as big as mine

I'm runnin' block
Turn the lights down low
Runnin' block
Don't want know one to know
That I tried to drink her skinny but she's still about 215
Sometimes you got to bow up
And take one for the team

She cleaned her plate at dinner
Then she ate what's left of mine
Then she wolfed down a big cheesecake as I drank all the wine
She strolled out to the padio for an after dinner cig
I said "Bro you done 'er this time and gonna owe me big

You know why?
'Cuz my brother's havin' a party
Thought you outta know
He's got coeds swimmin naked
