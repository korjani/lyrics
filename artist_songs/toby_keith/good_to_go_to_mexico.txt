I can feel a chill of a cold November wind 
Here in Oklahoma that means it is wintertime again
Every time I think about the rain and sleet and snow 
I start dreamin’ about siestas underneath this sombrero 

[Chorus 1:]
Baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to Mexico 
Get a place in Cabo, kick back in the sand 
It’ll be just you and me and moonlight dancing on the sea
To Spanish guitar melody of a mariachi band 

I got two tickets bought
There won’t be no second thought
Weather’s always nice down there in paradise 
We’ll find that little man who owns that taco stand 
We’ll be drinkin’ margaritas while we’re workin’ on our tan 

[Chorus 2:]
Baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to Mexico 
Get a place in Cabo, kick back in the sand
If you’ll get off that telephone and put your shorts and sandals on
Tomorrow we’ll be dancing to a mariachi band

Cancun don’t get me high 
That’s where the snow birds fly 
They like to winter there 
Then they come from everywhere 
I’ll take the Baja sun 
It ain’t overrun 
With the gringos and the touristas 
We might be the only ones 

[Repeat Chorus 1 (x2)]
