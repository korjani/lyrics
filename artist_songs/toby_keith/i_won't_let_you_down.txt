Pressed my lips on your sun-burnt skin
On a road by the river bend
Standing underneath the dead end sign
We swam around underneath the moon
And danced around a Bob Seger tune
And finished up a bottle of home-made wine

I never had to write a girl a song
Had a woman stay this long
And now you're moving in
And I'm alright with that

I ain't got a pot of gold
Girl I ain't even got a rainbow
But I've heard that love is where
Treasure can be found
Don't expect too much from me
And I won't let you down

Never been ashamed of the clothes I wear
I've never been a nickel millionaire
Never even bought myself a truck

I spent most of my life in a smoky bar
Playing country blues on box guitar
And I've done alright
You can call that luck

Never had to write a girl a song
Or had a woman stay this long
And now you're moving in
And I'm alright with that

I ain't got a pot of gold
Hell I ain't even got a rainbow
But I've heard that love is where 
Treasure can be found
Don't expect too much from me
And I won't let you down

Never had to write a girl a song
Had a woman stay this long
And now you're moving in
And I'm alright with that

I ain't got a pot of gold
Girl I ain't even got a rainbow
But I've heard that love is where 
Treasure can be found
Don't expect too much from me
And I won't let you down
Don't expect too much from me
And I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down, baby
