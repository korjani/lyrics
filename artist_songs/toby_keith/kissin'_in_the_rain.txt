Thunderbird was July hot now
Muddy lake was the perfect spot for
Camp fire, drinkin' beer
Skippin' half your senior year

Told your mama little white one
She didn't want you hangin' out in the sun
With a small town roughneck man
That will never be nothin' but an old field hand

Shut up with your girl friend
'Bout the time a storm rode in
Wind got up, it was pourin' down
We could hear the sirens goin' off in town

We were kissin' in the rain, kissin' in the rain
Hittin' hard like a hurricane
Summer nights lit up with lightnin'
Soakin' wet starin' in your eyes and

We didn't care a thing about the thunder
While the angry sky we were under
Was raisin' Cane
We were kissin' in the rain

You got in too late that night
And you and mama had a fight
You weren't ever gonna win
Never got to see me again

Well, I get storm the days roll by
Now and then I still drive
Cross the dam in my old Ford
I get out and walk that shore

I still see you standin' there
Blue jeans too wet to wear
Hair all drenched and out of place
And mascara runnin' down your face

Every time the clouds get low
And the sirens start to blow
I get a sweet little déjà vu
My Thunderbird, me and you

Were kissin' in the rain, kissin' in the rain
Hittin' hard like a hurricane
Summer nights lit up with lightnin'
Soakin' wet starin' in your eyes and

We didn't care a thing about the thunder
While the angry sky we were under
Was raisin' Cane
We were kissin' in the rain
Yeah
Kissin' in the rain
