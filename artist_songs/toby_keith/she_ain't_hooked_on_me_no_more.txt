[VERSE 1]
I gave up on cigarettes to the day, I ain't touched one yet
But tonight, I think I'm gonna burn the whole pack.
I laid off 90 proof, ain't had a drop in years and that's the truth
But tonight, when I light the first one, I'm gonna open up the Jack

[CHORUS]
She ain't hooked on me no more
She ain't hooked on me no more
The one thing that always hurt her the most
Is the one thing she finally quit fighting for
She ain't hooked on me no more
She ain't hooked on me no more
I'm pickin up all my bad habits again
She's letting one go

[VERSE 2]
For years she had it real bad
I was the only addiction she ever had
Her love made me so high, but I abused it.
And here I sit all alone tonight
Whiskey on the rocks and more cigarettes to light
Holdin on to everything I've got left, hopin I don't loose it.

[CHORUS]

She ain't hooked on me no more
She ain't hooked on me no more
I'm pickin up all my bad habits again
She's letting one go
Yeah, I'm pickin up all my bad habits again
She's letting one go
