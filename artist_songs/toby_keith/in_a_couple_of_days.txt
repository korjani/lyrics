Two weeks notice would've been real nice
I could've put this broken heart on ice
Barely full of whiskey, all laid up in bed
Given up on what lies ahead

Could've quit my job and let my beard grow out
Another sad old story that you hear about
But I got nothin' from you
Came without a warning at all

It was hot and dry when you told me goodbye
Now isn't that a hell of a deal?
Right out of the blue, you broke it in two
Now you wanna know how I feel

Why don't you come around when the swellin' goes down?
Right now I'm doin' okay
Hit me back
I should know something in a couple of days

It ain't soakin' you but I know that old pain
It will come like the storm once it starts to rain
Right now the sky is just a couple of clouds
It's gonna be hell once the bottom falls out

I might head for shelter, I might run and hide
I might take my chances standin' outside
It's too early to tell
Hell, you just left me today

It was hot and dry when you told me goodbye
Now isn't that a hell of a deal?
Right out of the blue, you broke it in two
And now you wanna know how I feel

Why don't you come around when the swellin' goes down?
Right now I'm doin' okay
Hit me back
I should know something in a couple of days

Why don't you come around when the swellin' goes down?
Right now I'm doin' okay
Hit me back
I should know something in a couple of days

Girl, hit me back
I should know something in a couple of days
