It's as sad as it's true
But I can't believe a word that you say
I've been hoping for the best
But there's less and less more everyday
You can't where you been
Behind that little grin
I can see
Girl you can't fool me

You've gone 
A little too far this time
You stepped one doorstep over the line
Swore you'd always be mine
I'd never leave you behind
But you've gone 
A little too far this time

You can tell me how it happened
Still I'd never understand why
All I can keep thinking is
He sure must be one hell of a guy
You can't blame no one else
You brought it all on yourself
Now it's gone
And it's time on cuz

You've gone 
A little too far this time
You stepped one doorstep over the line
Swore you'd always be mine
I'd never leave you behind
But you've gone 
Just a little too far this time

You've gone 
A little too far this time
You stepped one doorstep over the line
Swore you'd always be mine
I'd never leave you behind
But you've gone 
A little too far this time

Girl you've gone
Just a little too far this time
