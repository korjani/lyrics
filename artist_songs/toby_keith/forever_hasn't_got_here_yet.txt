Girl whatcha talkin' 'bout, I ain't believin' this
I ain't settlin' for none of this foolishness
We can't let a sure thing drown in a puddle of doubt
It's just some rocky road but we've got solid ground
It's just a little bump we can work around
We've got a lifetime ahead so don't go quittin' me now

Come on baby we're still together
This ain't as good as it's gonna get
I swore I'd love you 'til the end of forever
And forever hasn't got here yet

Does it matter girl who's really right or wrong
This ain't the kinda thing we should sleep on
I say we start it all over tonight with a kiss
So slide over here mamma, it's gonna be alright
Let's write it off as just another angry night
I like it better when we're makin' up like this

Come on baby we're still together
This ain't as good as it's gonna get
I swore I'd love you 'til the end of forever
And forever hasn't got here yet

Come on baby we're still together
This ain't as good as it's gonna get
I'll still love you 'til the end of forever
And forever hasn't got here yet

I'll still love you 'til the end of forever
And forever hasn't got here yet
No it hasn't got here yet
