I don't need this conversation
'Cause I don't need to see you cry
You need one more confirmation
Like I need one more reason why

I know this might not be the answer
Oh, that you came here to get
We both know that girl is somethin'
That I'm still not over yet

I cant go on using you
Girl, it feels like I'm losin' you
A love like yours is hard to find
But you caught me at a bad time

I knew that you'd be waiting
The night I made that desperate call
You weren't everything I needed
Just the softest place to fall

So I'm not gonna lie to you
Just keep stringing you along
Thought by now that I'd be better
But I guess I'm not that strong

And I can't go on using you
Oh, it feels like I'm losin' you
A love like yours is hard to find
You've caught me at a bad time

A love like yours is hard to find
You've caught me at a bad time
