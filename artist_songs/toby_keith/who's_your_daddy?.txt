Here you come knockin’ on my door baby 
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you’re lookin’ right, lookin’ good, lookin’ like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while
You run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you 
You know I got it 
Come and get it

Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby? 
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend? 

And who’s the one guy that you come runnin’ to 
When your lovelife starts tumblin’? 
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan

Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby? 
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?

You might’ve run on a little tough luck baby 
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you 
You know I got it
So come and get it

Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby? 
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?
