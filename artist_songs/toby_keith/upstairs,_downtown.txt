Route 14 Box 308
She said goodbye at the cattle-guard gate
Hoping she would find her a place in the world
With her mind made up and tears in her eyes
It almost made her daddy cry
He said don't forget to call when you get there girl.

Driving on that two lane road hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind

Moving upstairs, downtown
Life's too short to be hanging around
She's eighteen and it's time she got out of the wood
She's getting out while the getting's good

All bills paid and a room with a view
She's unpacked a dish or two
She just got her phone turned on today
There's a big, old world waiting just outside
As she's thumbing through the classifieds
Looking for work and any old job's okay

Driving on that cross-town freeway hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind

Living upstairs, downtown
Life's too short to be hanging around
She's eighteen and it's time she got out of the wood
She's getting out while the getting's good

Then she lost her job at the grocery store
And the wolf came knocking at the door
The red notice said they turned off her telephone
There's nothing left for her to do so she's packed up a thing or two
Loaded her car down, now she's headed home

Driving on that two lane road hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind

Living upstairs, downtown
Life's too short to be hanging around
She's eighteen and it's time she got back to the wood
She's getting out while the getting's good
