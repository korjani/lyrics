[Verse 1]

I see her layin' by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say

[Verse 2]

She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex

[Pre Chorus]

And she'll go out dancin' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limosine
I know where she's goin'
She's goin' downtown
I'm goin' downtown, too, and take a look around

[Chorus]

See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm tryin' hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man

[Verse 3]

I'm just sittin' 'round waitin' on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waitin'
And he'll be right there

[Pre Chorus]

Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's gettin' clogged up or maybe startin' to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy

[Chorus 2]

See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man...man

[Tag Chorus]

See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm tryin' hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man...no
