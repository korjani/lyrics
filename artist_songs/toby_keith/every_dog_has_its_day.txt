I was hangin' out a last night at the top cat when the band slowed down to Merle
Man I hit it 'cross the bar room trying to find my baby girl
Some drunk tried to punk me, and ask my baby "do you dance" she said "yes I do, but not with you, I'm waitin' on my man" 

See every dog has it's day dog, when the big dog throws him a bone
One moment in the sunshine when your ducks lined up in a row
Lucky dog get a big ol' bed, stray dog gets the porch
Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just aint yours

Well I flipped her around and I kissed her and she said lets do one more
And we were half way through a two step when he stepped out on the floor
He jerked me back and said "im cuttin' in, girl lets docee do" she doubled up her fist and caught him right square on the nose

Every dog has it's day dog, when the big dog throws him a bone
One moment in the sunshine when the ducks line up in a row
Lucky dog gets a big ol' bed, stray dog gets the porch
Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just aint yours

Fat dog, skinny dog, little itty bitty dog, hot dog, kurd dog, weenie dog, bird dog, hound dog, cow dog, bow wow wow dog, wonder dog, barkin' dog, chasing' parked car dog.

Every dog has it's day dog, when the big dog throws him a bone
One moment in the sunshine, when your ducks line up in a row
Yeah lucky dog gets gets a big ol' bed, stray dog gets the porch
Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just aint yours
Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just aint yours
