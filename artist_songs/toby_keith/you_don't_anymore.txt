We stood at the altar, repeating our vows for life
For better or worse, forever a husband and wife
Love's not always easy and dreams don't all come true
Why'd you lose your faith in me, I never gave up on you

When I said "I Do," I did, and the words were truly spoken
I gave you my heart to hold thinkin' it would go unbroken
You drifted so far you can't see the stars that we wished upon before
When I said "I Do," I did, but you don't anymore

These days nobody seems to try
To love through the hard times instead of just saying goodbye
We built this world around us, together hand in hand
And even if you walk away, it won't change where I stand

When I said "I Do," I did, and the words were truly spoken
I gave you my heart to hold thinkin' it would go unbroken
You drifted so far you can't see the stars that we wished upon before
When I said "I Do," I did, but you don't anymore
You drifted so far you can't see the stars that we wished upon before
When I said "I Do," I did, but you don't anymore
