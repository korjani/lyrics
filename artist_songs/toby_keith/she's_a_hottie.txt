She's sittin' by the water where the river gets wide, 
Think about swimming to the other side, 
Got a Malboro red, and a can of cold Bud 
Toes squished down in the Arkansas mud, 

Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her. 
Son, you ought to see her sister! 
You've got to give a little something to a cool dark cat, 
Finding him a woman who could shake like that, 
Hottie, she's a Hottie! Got a smokin' little body 
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo) 
She's rockin' that cowboy hat 
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty 
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey 

She's slappin' down a dam 
Where the moss gets thick, 
Yellin' Yee Haw! she's a redneck chick, 
Spittin' in the fire, puttin' on a show, 
Struttin like a chicken to the radio, 
Hey Slick! She's a hick! 
Hmmm and her butter milk lipstick 
Give a little something to a cool dark cat, 
Finding him a woman who could shake like that, 

Hottie, she's a Hottie! She got a smokin' little body 
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo) 
She's rockin' that cowboy hat 
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty 
Singing Kayay digidigy, 
Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey 

Dress her up boys, I took her from the farm, 
I brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm, 
You've got to give a little somethin' to a cool dark cat, 
Finding him a woman who could walk like that! 
She's a Hottie, she's a Hottie! She's got a smokin' little body 
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo) 
She's rockin' that cowboy hat 
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty 
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey 
Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy 
Yey hey Hey hey Hey 

Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, Yey Hey hey Hey
