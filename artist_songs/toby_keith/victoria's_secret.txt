Word sure gets around in a tattle tale town
That why she never goes out at night
But when her kids go to school and her husband's gone too
She gets in her care and she drives
To a little motel on the outskirts of town
Puts on her perfume and turns the bed down
And I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

Her husband's always working and he's never home
When he's there with her he's still gone
And she can't stand living and loving alone
Well she's got her children to raise, that's why she can't let it show
I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

It's PTA meetings, warm social greetings
A woman's work never gets done
It's church Sunday, it starts again Monday
Seems she's always on the run
And she gets so lonely it tears her in two
That's when she does what a woman must do
And I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

Her husband's always working and he's never home
When he's there with her he's still gone
And she can't stand living and loving alone
Well she's got her children to raise, that's why she can't let it show
I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

Ah she's got her children to raise that's why she can't let it show
I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

Yeah I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret
