I took her daddy’s old two-horse trailer 
I patched a place in the floor that was bare
And we loaded up her barrel pony 
And a riggin’ bag is all that I had 
Left with our suitcases filled with desire 
Four hundred dollars, two good spare tires 

[Chorus:]
Now our windshield’s a painting that hangs in our room 
Changes with each mile like a radio tune 
We got up above, we’ll make it on love 
Under the rodeo moon 

Sometimes we sleep in a hotel 
When we’re ridin’ that hot hand of luck 
Sometimes we crash at a friend’s house 
Sometimes we just sleep in the truck 
At nighttime you’ll find us out in the fast lane 
Stayin’ one step ahead of snow, wind, and rain 

[Chorus]
Yeah we left with our suitcases filled with desire 
Four hundred dollars, two good spare tires 

[Chorus]
