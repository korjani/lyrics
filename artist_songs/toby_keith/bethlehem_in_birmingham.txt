Christmas Eve in Birmingham
It's a long, long way from Bethlehem
Mary and Joe live outside of town
On an old, run-down farm
Mary says, Joe, you'd better get the car
My contractions ain't that far apart
But that Falcon stalled after sixty yards
Out behind the barn

So away to the stables go Mary and Joe
Now, it's not much shelter, but it keeps them from the cold
Mary's hurtin', Joe prays to God for a helping hand
They need a Bethlehem miracle tonight in Birmingham

A kerosene lantern is the only light
Joe says, Mary, don't give up the fight
She's gonna keep pushin' till the baby cries
If it takes her last breath
And as the dawn begins to break
Across the fields, valleys and the lakes
A baby's cry greets the light of day
Merry Christmas and God bless

So away in the stables lay Mary, the baby and Joe
It's not much shelter, but it keeps them from the cold
Mary's cradles her baby, Joe thanks God for the helping hand
There was a Bethlehem miracle last night in Birmingham
