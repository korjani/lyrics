Note to self
Better call
She'll be mad as hell
If I know her at all
Cuz today's her birthday
And I almost forgot
Note to self
I better not

Note to self
On my way home
Don't forget the roses
and Dom Perignon
You know how she loves a
Great big suprise
Note to self
You're skating on thin ice

Hmm I ain't gonna screw it up this time
Hmmm I'm gonna really make her proud she's mine

Note to self
Remember when
You use to light her up
When you walked in
And she stole your breath away
That's the way it was
Everytime you kissed her
And she still does

Hmm I ain't gonna mess it up this time
Hmmmmmmm I'm gonna really make her proud she's mine

Turning down the street
I'm pulling in the drive
Door ain't lock
So I step inside
She ain't here to greet me
So what's goin on?
Note self
She's already gone

Hmmmm gone
Hmmmmmmmm gone

Hmmmmmm I guess I really messed it up this time...
