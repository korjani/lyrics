My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a greyhound, and I went
To stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
A hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't
Last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbin' drillin' rig, I'm oil field trash and
Proud as I can be
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee

I've played every beer joint tavern from New York city out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
I am a red, white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U

A star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass wont
Ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and
Play it loud
As long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

I've played every beer joint tavern from New York city out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out ever basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
Son I'm a red, white, and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U
That's right a red, white, and blue
Blood graduate of honkytonk U
