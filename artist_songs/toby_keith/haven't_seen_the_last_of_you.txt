Woke up this morning
Reached out for you
Forgot that you were gone
But you can’t undo in a night
What you’ve been doing for so long
Got to wrap my brain around this thing
And it ain’t happened yet
Cos I can’t forget you, I can’t go get you
I can’t lie here in bed

I’ll have these memories of you in my mind if I don’t go insane
And I’ll dream about you girl if I don’t lie here wide awake
I know it’s ended, I know it’s finished
It’s done but I’m not through
Staring at the ceiling
I got a feeling
I haven’t seen the last of you

Carrying on like nothing’s wrong
In the spot we hung out in
Explaining why we said goodbye
Running to our friends
Ride home on the road you rode last night
When you rode out
Walked through the door and cross the floor
Feel you in this house

I’ll have these memories of you in my mind if I don’t go insane
And I’ll dream about you girl if I don’t lie here wide awake
I know it’s ended, I know it’s finished
It’s done but I’m not through
Staring at the ceiling
I got a feeling
I haven’t seen the last of you

Girl I’m gonna miss it but it was always missing something
You left before you hated me but I knew that it was coming
You might not be looking to find me but girl I bet you do
Staring at the ceiling
I got a feeling
I haven’t seen the last of you
I’ve got a feeling
I got a feeling
I haven’t seen the last of you
