[Chorus:]

Don't leave, I think I love you
I just saw the rest of my life, honey you're in it
Won't you hear what I say, give me a minute
Don't leave, I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, And you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good

Now baby Don't tell me that I missed my chance
I haven't heard last call, would you like to dance?
I've been sitting here waiting on you all night
Why don't you give me that old good-to-go green light
Am I coming on strong, baby movin' kinda fast
I'm rushing along but at least I gotta ask
I couldn't live with myself if you got away
I'm a love sick puppy, baby what do you say?

[Chorus]

It's late and been a long night, you're tired I know
Aw, don't break my heart, baby please don't go
It Ain't the shikey talkin', ain't this neon light
You see I've fallen stone-cold in love at first sight
Gonna cut to the chase, baby get right to it
I got a lot to say and a short time to do it
Aw, Don't walk away honey I'm just trying to
Aw... listen to me talkin', I'm a babblin' fool

[chorus]

Really baby, don't leave
I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, and you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good
