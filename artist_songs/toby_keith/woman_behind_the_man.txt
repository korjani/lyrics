Had this dream forever 
And it's comin' true at last 
Now lookin' back, the hard times 
Were just lessons from the past 
I finally climbed the highest mountain 
Now I'm standing tall 
There were sacrifices made 
But now the price is paid 
To you I owe it all 

You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I am who I am 
You've always been my guiding light 
Leading the way through love and life 
You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I'm who I am 

I know I never told you 
How much I depend on you 
But at my weakest moment 
You were strong and pulled me through 
You've been standing in the shadows 
You're still trying to 
But to watch you step aside 
Let me take this ride 
Is something I can't do 

You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I am who I am 
You've always been my guiding light 
Leading the way through love and life 
You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I'm who I am 

You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I am who I am 
You've always been my guiding light 
Leading the way through love and life 
You're not the woman behind the man 
You are the reason I'm who I am
