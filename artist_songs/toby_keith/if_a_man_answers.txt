You said you need a little time
A little time to yourself
I'm staring down this telephone wonderin'
There might be someone else

If a man answers when I call
I'll just hang up I won't say anything at all
If a man answers I know what I'll do
I'll lie here awake so I don't dream about you
If a man answers this time of night
At least I'll know somebody's holding you tight
If a man answers I won't call again
And I'll know where I stand while I twist in the wind

Oh baby I'm just missin' you
I'm crazy still in love with you
I know my heart will break in two
If a man answers, if a man answers

I just gotta tell you girl
Maybe somehow make you see
How much I want you to come back to me
But if a man answers you'll never know
He'll let you sleep while I let you go

Oh baby I'm just missin' you
I'm crazy still in love with you
I know my heart will break in two
If a man answers, if a man answers

If a man answers you'll never know
If a man answers I'll let you go
If a man answers this time of night
If a man answers he's holding you tight

If a man answers, if a man answers
If a man answers, if a man answers
If a man answers, oh if a man answers
If a man answers, if a man answers
