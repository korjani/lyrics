There's a band called The Lonely playin' downtown tonight
And man, they know their way around the blues
There's not an empty space in the parkin' lot
And there's a line stretchin' around the block
And the sad man standin' at the door says the place is full of broken hearts

If you're hear to see The Lonely, if you're hear to see The Lonely
It's standin' room only for The Lonely

Oh, you can dance with a stranger under the smoky blue lights
You can stand alone with lovers who love to lose
You can drown in your pain if there's room at the bar
You can hide your tears, you can cry in the dark
While The Lonely sings a song straight to your broken heart

If you're hear to see The Lonely, if you're hear to see The Lonely
It's standin' room only

If you're hear to see The Lonely, if you're hear to see The Lonely
It's standin' room only
If you're hear to see The Lonely, if you're hear to see The Lonely
If you're hear to see The Lonely, if you're hear to see The Lonely
