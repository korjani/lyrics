He turned 87 on the 2nd day of June.
In case nobody's countin' Son, that's many a moon.
You'll find him down on Main Street. That's where he likes to walk.
It's worth the price of admission just to hear that old man talk.

He's the last livin' cowboy in this town.
He rode off into the sunset, yet naw, he's still kickin' round.
You'll find him halfway liquored up on Caddo County shine,
Or all the way drunk half the time.

He's got 40 head of cattle down on Turkey creek.
There's always some old stray dog round the cabin at his feet.
His family left for California back in '29.
When it was two bits for the whiskey, and tobacco was a dime.

He's the last livin' cowboy in this town.
He rode off into the sunset, yet he's still kickin' round.
You'll find him halfway liquored up on Caddo county shine,
Or all the way drunk half the time.

Keeps a jack knife in his pocket and pistol in his boot.
I've heard a lot of stories, but I've never seen him shoot.
A '60 model pickup's all I've ever seen him drive.
He 'aint rode a horse since the day ole Bully died.

He's the last livin' cowboy in this town.
He rode off into the sunset, yet he's still kickin' round.
You'll find him halfway liquored up on Caddo County shine,
Or all the way drunk half the time.

Yeah, you'll find him halfway liquored up on Caddo County shine,
Or all the way drunk half the time.
