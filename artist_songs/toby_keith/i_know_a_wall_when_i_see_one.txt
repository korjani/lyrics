Blue eyes, brown hair, yeah that's my past standing there
Turning every head in here tonight
That smile, that laugh, everyone is staring at
The one thing that stands between
Me and the rest of my life

I know a wall when I see one
And I'm looking at one right now
Heartaches written all over this one
One I can't get around
Where's a door when you need one
I know a wall when I see one

The hurt had stopped, at least that's what I thought
Up until what use to be walked in
Just flesh and bone, it might as well be stone
'Cause it's a memory I can't get past
That's what I'm up against

I know a wall when I see one
And I'm looking at one right now
Heartaches written all over this one
One I can't get around
Where's a door when you need one
I know a wall when I see one

After all my heart's been through
Look what it's run into

I know a wall when I see one
And I'm looking at one right now
Heartaches written all over this one
One I can't get around
Where's a door when you need one
I know a wall when I see one
I know a wall
