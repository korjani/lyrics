Someboyd told you that my broken heart started mending
I'm getting by, but the truth is that I'm still standing
Knee deep in yesterday's rain

Well I ain't high and dry, I ain't got a big boat
But I got a new umbrella and an overcoat
And if the good Lord's willing and the sun breaks through
That'll be one more day that I made it without you
That I made it without you

I don't care what the future holds
And don't care about what you've been told
Don't want to hear what the weatherman has to say
'Cause I'm standing knee deep in yesterday's rain

All those fools go rushing, they don't hesitate
And the lonely go looking where the losers wait
And I'm thinking, somewhere in the middle there's a love that's true
But I ain't found one yet, and I ain't got you
No I ain't got you baby

I don't care what the future holds
And don't care about what you've been told
Don't want to hear what the weatherman has to say
'Cause I'm standing knee deep in yesterday's rain
Yesterday's rain, yesterday's rain, yesterday's rain

Somebody told you that my broken heart started mending
