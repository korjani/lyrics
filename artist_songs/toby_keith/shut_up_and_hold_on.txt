Just got paid I got a little money
Aftershave and after a honey
Got my name on a shot of Jack whiskey
Gonna roll with me, you gotta roll quickly

Get in, Sit down, Shut up and hold on
Can't wait. Too late. It's time to get gone
Show up downtown, get us a buzz on
Get in, Sit down, Shut up and hold on
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Shoot a little pool, shoot a little 8 ball
Ain't goin' home
Make a little phone call
Feelin' pretty good
Stumble out the front door
She pulls up in a farm girl Ford singin'

Get in, Sit down, Shut up, and Hold on
Can't wait. Too late. It's time to get gone
Find us a dirt road get a groove on
Get in, Sit down, Shut up and Hold on

There's no time like night time and the moonlight
To have a good time
Baby let's throw down, don't slow down
If I'm gonna go down
I'm gonna go down crazy
Get in, Sit down, Shut up and Hold on
Can't wait. Too late. It's time to get gone
Find us a dirt road and get a groove on
Get in, Sit down, Shut up and Hold on
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Get in.
Sit down.
Shut up.
Hold on!

There's no time than the night time
In the moonlight, to have a good time
Baby lets throw down, don't slow down
If I go down, I'm gonna go down crazy
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
