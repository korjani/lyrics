Never owned a brand new car
Never worked in a white collar
Never held a woman longer
Than I held one single dollar
I never went out chasin’ rainbows 
‘Cause there can’t be that much to it 
Even if I found my pot of gold 
I know I’d piss right through it 

I can’t remember ever wanting
For one second of my life 
Even if I did it cost too much 
To ever pay the price
I don’t dance out on the dark side
Ain’t no secrets I have to tell
So you don’t have to say a prayer for me 
I just said one for myself 

[Chorus:]
I’m livin’ my life
Under my terms 
I’m callin’ the shots
As far as I can see
I don’t owe nobody nothin’
I don’t answer to a soul
Might not work for you 
But it works for me 

I’ve been bent and bruised and broken
And flat busted once or twice
I brought most of it upon myself
But I never compromised 
My pride’s too hard to swallow
So I’ve chewed a lot of it 
Mild-mannered and soft-hearted
And hard-headed as you get
I live out on the backroads 
Where I walk my country mile
And if it’s so good in the city 
Why don’t anybody smile?
The traffic’s always heavy
And the air ain’t fit to breathe
I ain’t saying that it’s wrong for you 
It just don’t make sense to me

[Chorus]
