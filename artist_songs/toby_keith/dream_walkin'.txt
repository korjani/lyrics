She left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle
On a table beside my bed
With a short little note that said I had a good time
It was written in lipstick red
She didn't sign her name I wonder 
If that a little secret that she keeps
Ooo... she's walkin' around in my sleep

Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's callin' my name again
Day's breakin' I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

She took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
And she never even bothered to ask
You could say I haven't seen her since late last summer
But every night she comes back
Just like smoke through the keyhole
She slips in so silently 
Ooo... she's walkin' around in my sleep

Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's callin' my name again
Day's breakin' I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in
I'm on a roll now I gotta know how this dream ends

Ooo... there's a thin line between dreams and memories
I'll be losin' my mind 'till she comes back to me

Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's callin' my name again
Day's breakin I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in
I'm on a roll now I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now I gotta know how this dream ends

She's walkin' around in my sleep
She's walkin' around in my sleep
